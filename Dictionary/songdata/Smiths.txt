Spending warm summer days indoors  
Writing frightening verse  
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg  
  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
Ask me, ask me, ask me  
  
Because if it's not love  
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb  
That will bring us together

Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
I'm tired and I  
I want to go to bed  
  
Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
And then leave me alone  
Don't try to wake me in the morning  
'Cause I will be gone  
Don't feel bad for me  
I want you to know  
Deep in the cell of my heart  
I will feel so glad to go

I would rather not go  
Back to the old house

Back to the old house  
There's too many  
Bad memories  
Too many memories  
There...  
There...  
There...  
When you cycled by  
Here began all my dreams  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
And you never knew  
How much I really liked you  
Because I never even told you  
Oh, and I meant to  
Are you still there ?  
Or...have you moved away ?  
Or have you moved away ?  
Oh...  
I would love to go  
Back to the old house  
But I never will  
I never will...  
I never will...  
I never will...

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking  
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth  
In your head  
  
Oh...sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking  
When I said by rights you should be  
Bludgeoned in your bed

Well, it happens a lot 'round here  
And if you think Peace  
Is a common goal  
That goes to show  
How little you know  
  
The death of a disco dancer  
Well, I'd rather not get involved  
I never talk to my neighbour

Girlfriend in a coma, I know  
I know - it's really serious  
  
There were times when I could  
Have "murdered" her  
(but you know, I would hate  
Anything to happen to her)  
  
No, I don't want to see her  
  
Do you really think

Call me morbid, call me pale  
I've spent six years on your trail  
Six long years  
On your trail  
  
Call me morbid, call me pale  
I've spent six years on your trail  
Six full years of my life on your trail  
  
And if you have five seconds to spare  
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:  
Sixteen, clumsy and shy  
I went to London and I  
I booked myself in at the Y... W.C.A.  
I said: "I like it here - can I stay?  
I like it here - can I stay?  
Do you have a vacancy  
For a back-scrubber?"  
  
She was left behind, and sour  
And she wrote to me, equally dour  
She said: "In the days when you were  
Hopelessly poor  
I just liked you more..."  
  
And if you have five seconds to spare  
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:  
Sixteen, clumsy and shy

Call me morbid, call me pale  
I've spent too long on your trail  
Far too long  
Chasing your tail  
Oh...

Hand in glove  
The sun shines out of our behinds  
No, it's not like any other love  
This one is different - because it's us  
  
Hand in glove  
We can go wherever we please  
And everything depends upon  
How near you stand to me  
  
And if the people stare  
Then the people stare  
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care  
  
Kiss my shades  
  
Hand in glove  
The good people laugh  
Yes, we may be hidden by rags  
But we've something they'll never have

Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care  
  
Kiss my shades...oh...  
  
So, hand in glove I stake my claim  
I'll fight to the last breath  
  
If they dare touch a hair on your head  
I'll fight to the last breath  
  
For the good life is out there somewhere  
So stay on my arm, you little charmer  
  
But I know my luck too well  
Yes, I know my luck too well  
And I'll probably never see you again  
I'll probably never see you again  
I'll probably never see you again  
Oh

All the streets are crammed with things  
Eager to be held  
I know what hands are for  
And I'd like to help myself  
You ask me the time  
But I sense something more  
And I would like to give  
What I think you're asking for  
You handsome devil  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it  
A boy in the bush  
Is worth two in the hand  
I think I can help you get through your exams  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Oh, let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it  
And when we're in your scholarly room  
Who will swallow whom ?

You handsome devil  
Oh, let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
There's more to life than books, you know  
But not much more  
Oh, there's more to life than books, you know  
But not much more, not much more  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Ow

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour  
But heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
In my life  
Why do I give valuable time  
To people who don't care if I live or die?  
  
Two lovers entwined pass me by  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
In my life  
Oh, why do I give valuable time  
To people who don't care if I live or die?  
  
What she asked of me at the end of the day  
Caligula would have blushed  
  
"You've been in the house too long" she said  
And I (naturally) fled  
  
In my life  
Why do I smile  
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does

There's a club if you'd like to go  
You could meet somebody who really loves you  
So you go and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home and you cry  
And you want to die  
  
When you say it's gonna happen "now"  
Well when exactly do you mean?  
See I've already waited too long  
And all my hope is gone  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?

Bought on stolen wine  
A nod was the first step  
You knew very well  
What was coming next  
  
Bought on stolen wine  
A nod was the first step  
You knew very well  
What was coming next  
  
Did I really walk all this way  
Just to hear you say :  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight" ?  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"  
  
Oh, but you will  
For you must  
  
I don't owe you anything, no  
But you owe me something  
Repay me now  
  
You should never go to them  
Let them come to you  
Just like I do  
Just like I do  
  
You should not go to them  
Let them come to you  
Just like I do  
Just like I do

But you will  
For you must  
  
I don't owe you anything, no  
But you owe me something  
Repay me now  
  
Too freely on your lips  
Words prematurely sad  
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight  
  
Life is never kind  
Life is never kind  
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight

Hate, love and war  
Force emotions to the fore  
But not for me, of course  
Of course  
I keep mine hidden  
Oh...  
  
I keep mine hidden  
But it's so easy for you  
Because you let yours flail  
Into public view  
Oh, oh...  
  
Yellow and green  
A stumbling block  
I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock  
With a past where to be 'touched'  
Meant to be 'mental'  
  
Ooh, I keep mine hidden  
The lies are so easy for you  
Because you let yours slide  
Into public view  
Oh...  
  
Use your loaf!

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
And as I climb into an empty bed  
Oh well. Enough said.  
I know it's over - still I cling  
I don't know where else I can go  
Oh...  
  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
See, the sea wants to take me  
The knife wants to slit me  
Do you think you can help me?  
  
Sad veiled bride, please be happy  
Handsome groom, give her room  
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly  
(Though she needs you  
More than she loves you)  
And I know it's over - still I cling  
I don't know where else I can go  
Over and over and over and over  
Over and over, la...  
  
I know it's over  
And it never really began  
But in my heart it was so real  
And you even spoke to me, and said :  
"If you're so funny  
Then why are you on your own tonight ?  
And if you're so clever  
Then why are you on your own tonight ?  
If you're so very entertaining  
Then why are you on your own tonight ?  
If you're so very good-looking  
Why do you sleep alone tonight ?  
I know...  
  
'Cause tonight is just like any other night  
That's why you're on your own tonight  
With your triumphs and your charms  
While they're in each other's arms..."  
It's so easy to laugh  
It's so easy to hate  
It takes strength to be gentle and kind  
Over, over, over, over  
  
It's so easy to laugh  
It's so easy to hate  
It takes guts to be gentle and kind  
Over, over  
Love is natural and real  
But not for you, my love  
Not tonight, my love  
Love is natural and real  
But not for such as you and I, my love  
  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my ...  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can even feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my...

The lanes were silent  
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles  
I doused our friendly venture  
With a hard-faced  
Three-word gesture  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
...And now I'm not too sure  
  
I grabbed you by the guilded beams  
Uh, that's what tradition means  
And I doused another venture  
With a gesture  
That was...absolutely vile  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me

Uh, that's what tradition means  
And now eighteen months' hard labour  
Seems...fair enough  
  
I started something

Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me

I started something  
And now I'm not too sure  
  
OK Stephen? ...Do that again?

On the day that your mentality  
Decides to try to catch up with your biology  
  
Come round ...  
'Cause I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad  
It's all over, all over, all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
  
I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad  
It's all over, all over, all over my face  
  
A double bed  
And a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
A double bed  
And a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
And I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad  
It's all over, all over my face  
  
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails  
Raised on Prisoner's Aid  
He killed a policeman when he was  
Thirteen  
And somehow that really impressed  
Me  
And it's written all over my face  
  
Oh, these are the riches of the poor  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad  
It's written all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
  
And if you ever need self-validation  
Just meet me in the alley by the  
Railway station  
It's all over my face  
Oh...

I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And ambition  
The zeal I feel  
This is my time  
  
The note I wrote  
As she read, she said  
"Has the Perrier gone  
Straight to my head  
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"  
  
"Yes!"  
No - no - no - no - no - no  
No - no - no - no - no - no  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
Life tends to come and go  
That's OK  
As long as you know  
Life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know, know, know, know, know  
Know, know, know, know  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
I want the freedom and I want the guile  
I want the freedom and the guile  
Oh, life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know, know, know, know  
Know, know, know, know  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
I'll see you somewhere  
I'll see you sometime  
Darling...

I left the North  
I traveled South  
I found a tiny house  
And I can't help the way I feel  
Oh yes, you can kick me  
  
And you can punch me  
And you can break my face  
But you won't change the way I feel  
'Cause I love you  
Oh...  
  
And is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ?  
I say NO, you say YES  
(and you will change your mind)  
  
I left the South  
I traveled North  
I got confused - I killed a horse  
I can't help the way I feel  
Oh yes, you can punch me  
  
And you can butt me  
And you can break my spine  
But you won't change the way I feel  
'Cause I love you  
Oh ...  
  
And is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ?  
I say NO, you say YES  
(But you will change your mind)  
  
I left the North again  
I traveled South again  
And I got confused - I killed a nun  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell)  
  
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ?  
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes  
And I realized, I realized  
I could never  
I could never, never, never, go back home again

Jeane,  
The low life has lost its appeal  
And I'm tired of walking these streets  
To a room with its cupboards bare  
Jeane,  
I'm not sure what happiness means  
But I look in your eyes and I know...  
That it isn't there  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...  
Oh Jeane...  
  
There's ice on the sink where we bathe  
So how can you call this a home  
When you know its a grave  
Yet you still have that greedy grace...  
As you tidy the place  
But it will never be clean...  
Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...  
  
Gash on the nail  
Its just a fairytale...  
And I don't believe in magic anymore, Jeane...  
  
But I think you know,  
I really think you know  
Oh yes I think you know the truth, Jeane  
  
No heavenly choirs not for me  
And no not for you  
Because I think you know  
I really think you know  
I think you know the truth  
Oh Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...

Smoke  
Lingers 'round your fingers  
Train  
Heave on - to Euston  
Do you think you've made  
The right decision this time?  
Oh...  
  
You left  
Your tired family grieving  
And you think they're sad because you're leaving  
But did you see Jealousy in the eyes  
Of the ones who had to stay behind?  
And do you think you've made  
The right decision this time?  
  
You left  
Your girlfriend on the platform  
With this really ragged notion that you'll return  
But she knows  
That when he goes  
He really goes  
And do you think you've made  
The right decision this time?

Heifer whines could be human cries  
Closer comes the screaming knife  
This beautiful creature must die  
This beautiful creature must die  
A death for no reason  
And death for no reason is MURDER  
  
And the flesh you so fancifully fry  
Is not succulent, tasty or kind  
It's death for no reason  
And death for no reason is MURDER  
  
And the calf that you carve with a smile  
Is MURDER  
And the turkey you festively slice  
Is MURDER  
Do you know how animals die ?  
  
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely  
It's not "comforting", cheery or kind  
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench  
Of MURDER  
  
It's not "natural", "normal" or kind  
The flesh you so fancifully fry  
The meat in your mouth  
As you savour the flavour  
Of MURDER  
  
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER  
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER  
Oh...and who hears when animals cry ?

So, goodbye  
Please stay with your own kind  
And I'll stay with mine  
  
There's something against us  
It's not time  
It's not time  
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
  
I know I need hardly say  
How much I love your casual way  
Oh, but please put your tongue away  
A little higher and we're well away  
The dark nights are drawing in  
And your humor is as black as them  
I look at yours, you laugh at mine  
And "love" is just a miserable lie  
You have destroyed my flower-like life  
Not once - twice  
You have corrupt my innocent mind  
Not once - twice  
I know the wind-swept mystical air  
It means : I'd like to see your underwear  
I recognize that mystical air  
It means : I'd like to seize your underwear  
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?  
Just a rented room in Whalley Range  
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?  
...Whalley Range !  
Into the depths of the criminal world  
I followed her ...  
  
I need advice, I need advice  
I need advice, I need advice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
Nobody ever looks at me twice  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The world  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The world  
  
I'm just a country-mile behind  
The whole world  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh, oh...  
  
Take me when you go  
Oh oh, oh ...  
  
I need advice, I need advice

When you walk without ease  
On these  
Streets where you were raised  
I had a really bad dream  
It lasted twenty years, seven months, and twenty seven days  
I never, I'm alone, and I  
Never, ever oh, had no one ever  
  
Now I'm outside your house  
I'm alone  
And I'm outside your house  
I hate to intrude  
Oh, alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone  
I'm alone  
I'm alone  
And I never, never, oh, had no one ever  
I never had no one ever  
I never had no, no one ever  
Had no one never  
Never, no  
Oh

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world  
I am a man of means (of slender means)  
Each household appliance  
Is like a new science in my town  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
It's such a sad sound  
No...  
It's such a sad thing  
  
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen  
Every sensible child will know what this means  
The poor and the needy  
Are selfish and greedy on her terms  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
It's such a sad sound  
No...  
It's such a sad thing  
  
And when I'm lying in my bed  
I think about life  
And I think about death  
And neither one particularly appeals to me  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie  
In the middle of the street and die  
I'd lie down and die...  
Oh, oh

At the record company meeting  
On their hands - a dead star  
And oh, the plans they weave  
And oh, the sickening greed  
  
At the record company party  
On their hands - a dead star  
The sycophantic slags all say :  
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"  
  
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!  
Re-evaluate the songs  
Double-pack with a photograph  
Extra track (and a tacky badge)  
  
A-list, playlist  
"Please them , please them !"  
"Please them !"  
(sadly, this was your life)  
  
But you could have said no  
If you'd wanted to  
You could have said no  
If you'd wanted to  
  
BPI, MTV, BBC  
"Please them ! Please then!"  
(sadly this was your life)  
  
But you could have said no  
If you'd wanted to  
You could have walked away  
...Couldn't you?  
  
I touched you at the soundcheck  
You had no real way of knowing  
In my heart I begged "Take me with you ...  
I don't care where you're going..."  
  
But to you I was faceless  
I was fawning, I was boring  
Just a child from those ugly new houses  
Who could never begin to know  
  
Who could never really know  
Oh...  
  
Best of! Most of!  
Satiate the need  
Slip them into different sleeves!  
Buy both, and feel deceived  
  
Climber - new entry, re-entry  
World tour! ("media whore")  
"Please the Press in Belgium!"  
(This was your life...)  
  
And when it fails to recoup ?  
Well, maybe :  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
  
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck  
You're just the same as I am  
What makes most people feel happy  
Leads us headlong into harm  
  
So, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'  
I danced my legs down to the knees  
But me and my 'true love'  
Will never meet again...  
  
At the record company meeting  
On their hands - at last! - A dead star !  
But they can never taint you in my eyes  
No, they can never touch you now  
  
No, they cannot hurt you, my darling  
They cannot touch you now  
But me and my 'true love'  
Will never meet again

Panic on the streets of London  
Panic on the streets of Birmingham  
I wonder to myself  
Could life ever be sane again?  
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down  
I wonder to myself  
Hopes may rise on the grasmere  
But honey pie, you're not safe here  
So you run down  
To the safety of the town  
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle  
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside  
I wonder to myself  
  
Burn down the disco  
Hang the blessed dj  
Because the music that they constantly play  
It says nothing to me about my life  
Hang the blessed dj  
Because the music they constantly play  
  
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down  
Provincial towns you jog 'round  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj  
Hang the dj

Good times for a change  
See, the luck I've had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
  
So please please please  
Let me, let me, let me  
Let me get what I want  
This time  
  
Haven't had a dream in a long time  
See, the life I've had  
Can make a good man bad  
  
So for once in my life  
Let me get what I want  
Lord knows, it would be the first time  
Lord knows, it would be the first time

Upon the sand, upon the bay  
"There is a quick and easy way" you say  
Before you illustrate  
I'd rather state :  
"I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not the man you think I am"  
  
And sorrow's native son  
He will not smile for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh...  
  
End of the pier, end of the bay  
You tug my arm, and say : "give in to lust,  
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll  
Soon be dust... "  
  
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not the man you think I am  
  
And sorrow's native son  
He will not rise for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh really ?  
Oh...  
  
I could have been wild and I could have  
Been free  
But nature played this trick on me  
  
She wants it now  
And she will not wait  
But she's too rough  
And I'm too delicate  
  
Then, on the sand  
Another man, he takes her hand  
A smile lights up her stupid face  
(and well, it would)  
  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith...  
Oh...  
  
Hand in glove...  
The sun shines out of our behinds...  
Oh...

It's time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
  
It's time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
You made him old  
  
Reel around the fountain  
Slap me on the patio  
I'll take it now  
Oh...  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Well, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead  
And they were so wrong  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh, well, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people said that you were easily led  
And they were half-right  
Oh, they...oh, they were half-right, oh  
  
It's time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
It's time that the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
You made him old  
  
Oh, reel around the fountain  
Slap me on the patio  
I'll take it now  
Ah...oh...  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people see no worth in you  
Oh, but I do.  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people see no worth in you  
I do.  
Oh, I...oh, I do  
Oh...  
  
I dreamt about you last night  
And I fell out of bed twice  
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly  
But "take me to the haven of your bed"  
Was something that you never said  
Two lumps, please  
You're the bee's knees  
But so am I  
  
Oh, meet me at the fountain  
Shove me on the patio  
I'll take it slowly  
Oh...  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people see no worth in you  
Oh, but I do.  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh, no, I wouldn't say no  
Oh, people see no worth in you  
I do.  
Oh, I...I do  
Oh, I do  
Oh, I do  
Oh, I do

A sad fact widely known  
The most impassionate song  
To a lonely soul  
Is so easily outgrown  
But don't forget the songs  
That made you smile  
And the songs that made you cry  
When you lay in awe  
On the bedroom floor  
And said : "Oh, oh, smother me Mother..."  
No...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
  
The passing of time  
And all of its crimes  
Is making me sad again  
The passing of time  
And all of its sickening crimes  
Is making me sad again  
But don't forget the songs  
That made you cry  
And the songs that saved your life  
Yes, you're older now  
And you're a clever swine  
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you  
  
The passing of time leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled (the passing...)  
The passing of time  
Leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled  
I'm here with the cause  
I'm holding the torch  
In the corner of your room  
Can you hear me?  
And when you're dancing and laughing  
And finally living  
Hear my voice in your head  
And think of me kindly  
No ...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
No...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
  
Do you  
Love me like you used to?  
Oh...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
  
You're clever  
Everybody's clever nowadays  
You're clever  
Everybody's clever nowadays  
  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping

The last night of the fair  
By the big wheel generator  
A boy is stabbed  
And his money is grabbed  
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine  
  
She is famous  
She is funny  
An engagement ring  
Doesn't mean a thing  
To a mind consumed by brass (money)  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone...  
...But my faith in love is still devout  
  
The last night of the fair  
From a seat on a whirling waltzer  
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye  
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)  
From a seat on a whirling waltzer  
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye  
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone...  
...But my faith in love is still devout  
  
Then someone falls in love  
And someone's beaten up  
Someone's beaten up  
And the senses being dulled are mine  
And someone falls in love  
And someone's beaten up  
And the senses being dulled are mine  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone ...  
...But my faith in love is still devout  
  
This is the last night of the fair  
And the grease in the hair  
Of a speedway operator  
Is all a tremulous heart requires  
A schoolgirl is denied  
She said : "How quickly would I die  
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"  
La...  
  
This is the last night of the fair  
And the grease in the hair  
Of a speedway operator  
Is all a tremulous heart requires  
A schoolgirl is denied  
She said : "How quickly would I die  
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"  
La...  
  
So...scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen  
(This means you really love me)  
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen  
(This means you really love me)  
Oh...  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I just might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout  
I might walk home alone  
But my faith in love is still devout

Is it wrong to want to live on your own?  
No, it's not wrong - but I must know  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad?  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear  
And don't go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
Oh...  
  
Is it wrong not to always be glad ?  
No, it's not wrong - but I must add  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad ?  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear  
And don't go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh, la...  
You're a girl and I'm a boy  
La...  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh, la...  
I'm a girl and you're a boy  
La...  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
La...  
Throw your homework onto the fire  
Come out and find the one that you love  
Come out and find the one you love

Learn to love me  
Assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a list of crime  
My only weakness is...well, never mind, never mind  
  
Oh, shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
  
Learn to love me  
And assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow, and always  
My only weakness is a listed crime  
But last night the plans of a future war  
Was all I saw on Channel Four  
  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
  
A heartless hand on my shoulder  
A push - and it's over  
Alabaster crashes down  
(Six months is a long time)  
Tried living in the real world  
Instead of a shell  
But before I began...  
I was bored before I even began  
  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Take over

I decree today that life  
Is simply taking and not giving  
England is mine - it owes me a living  
But ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye  
Oh, ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye  
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore  
No, we cannot cling to those dreams  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body?  
I dunno  
  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasn't like the old days anymore  
No, it wasn't like those days  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body?  
I dunno  
  
Ask me why, and I'll die  
Oh, ask me why, and I'll die  
And if you must, go to work - tomorrow  
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother  
For there are brighter sides to life  
And I should know, because I've seen them  
But not very often  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasn't like the old days anymore  
No, it wasn't like those days  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
Oh, am I still ill?  
Oh

All the lies that you make up  
What's at the back of your mind?  
Oh, your face I can see  
And it's desperately kind  
But what's at the back of your mind?  
  
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way  
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins  
Amid concrete and clay  
And general decay  
Nature must still find a way  
So ignore all the codes of the day  
Let your juvenile impulses sway  
This way and that way  
This way, that way  
God, how sex implores you  
To let yourself lose yourself  
  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Let your puny body, lie down, lie down  
As we lie, you say  
As we lie, you say  
Stretch out and...  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Let your puny body lie down, lie down  
  
As we lie, you say :  
Will the world end in the night time?  
(I really don't know)  
Or will the world end in the day time?  
(I really don't know)  
And is there any point ever having children?  
Oh, I don't know  
All I do know is we're here and it's now  
  
So...stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
There is no debate, no debate, no debate  
How can you consciously contemplate  
When there's no debate, no debate?  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Oh...

Over the moor, take me to the moor  
Dig a shallow grave  
And I'll lay me down  
  
Over the moor, take me to the moor  
Dig a shallow grave  
And I'll lay me down  
  
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads  
Oh John, you'll never be a man  
And you'll never see your home again  
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for  
  
Edward, see those alluring lights ?  
Tonight will be your very last night  
  
A woman said : "I know my son is dead  
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"  
  
Hindley wakes and Hindley says :  
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says :  
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"  
  
But fresh lilaced moorland fields  
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death  
Fresh lilaced moorland fields  
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death  
  
Hindley wakes and says :  
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says :  
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"  
  
But this is no easy ride  
For a child cries :  
  
"Oh, find me...find me, nothing more  
We are on a sullen misty moor  
We may be dead and we may be gone  
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side  
Until the day you die  
This is no easy ride  
We will haunt you when you laugh  
Yes, you could say we're a team  
You might sleep  
You might sleep  
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !  
Oh, you might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !  
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !"  
  
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for  
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for  
  
Oh, find me, find me !  
Find me !  
I'll haunt you when you laugh  
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh  
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !  
Oh...  
Over the moors, I'm on the moor  
Oh, over the moor  
Oh, the child is on the moor

He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
And he said that he'd never, never do it again  
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)  
  
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again  
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)  
  
Poor old man  
He had an "accident" with a three-bar fire  
But that's o.k.  
Because he wasn't very happy anyway  
Poor woman  
Strangled in her very own bed as she read  
But that's o.k.  
Because she was old and she would have died anyway  
Don't blame  
  
The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again  
(not until the next time)  
  
Jury, you've heard every word  
So before you decide  
Would you look into those "mother me" eyes  
I love you for you, my love, you my love  
You my love, you my love  
Jury, you've heard every word  
But before you decide  
Would you look into those "mother me" eyes  
I love you for you my love, you my love  
I love you just for you, my love  
Don't blame  
  
The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never do it again  
And...  
"In the midst of life we are in death etc."  
Don't forget the hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never do it again  
And...  
"In the midst of life we are in death etc."  
  
Etc! etc! etc! etc!  
In the midst of life we are in death etc!  
Etc! etc! etc! etc!  
In the midst of life we are in debt etc!  
  
Just will you free me?  
Will you find me?  
Will you free me?  
Will you find me?  
Will you free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me?  
Jury will you free me?  
Will you find me?  
Will you free me?  
Will you find me?  
How will you find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me?  
Oh etc! etc! etc! etc! etc! etc!  
Etc! etc! etc! etc!  
In the midst of life we are in debt etc!  
Oh...oh...

The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A murderous desire for love  
How can they look into my eyes  
And still they don't believe me?  
How can they hear me say those words  
Still they don't believe me?  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever believe me?  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever, they ever, believe me?  
Oh  
  
The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A plundering desire for love  
How can they see the Love in our eyes  
And still they don't believe us?  
And after all this time  
They don't want to believe us  
And if they don't believe us now  
Will they ever believe us?  
And when you want to live  
How do you start?  
Where do you go?  
Who do you need to know?  
  
Oh  
Oh no  
Oh  
La

Please don't cry  
For the ghost and the storm outside  
Will not invade this sacred shrine  
Nor infiltrate your mind  
My life down I shall lie  
If the bogey-man should try  
To play tricks on your sacred mind  
To tease, torment, and tantalize  
Wavering shadows loom  
A piano plays in an empty room  
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight  
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright  
I'll still be by your side  
For you are all that matters  
And I'll love you to till the day I die  
There never need be longing in your eyes  
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine  
Ceiling shadows shimmy by  
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey  
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes  
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes  
My life down I shall lie  
Should restless spirits try  
To play tricks on your sacred mind  
I once had a child, and it saved my life  
And I never even asked his name  
I just looked into his wondrous eyes  
And said : "never never never again"  
And all too soon I did return  
Just like a moth to a flame  
So rattle my bones all over the stones  
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns  
Oh, see how words as old as sin  
Fit me like a glove  
I'm here and here I'll stay  
Together we lie, together we pray  
There never need be longing in your eyes  
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine  
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine  
Mine  
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy  
Although you're only three, sonny boy  
You're - you're mine  
And your mother she just never knew  
Oh, your mother...  
As long...as long...as long  
I did my best for her  
I did my best for her  
As long...as long...as long as...as long  
I did my best for her  
I did my best for her  
Oh...

Belligerent ghouls  
Run Manchester schools  
  
Spineless swines  
Cemented minds  
  
Sir leads the troops  
Jealous of youth  
Same old suit since 1962  
  
He does the military two-step  
Down the nape of my neck  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
Give up education  
As a bad mistake  
  
Mid-week on the playing fields  
Sir thwacks you on the knees  
  
Knees you in the groin  
Elbow in the face  
Bruises bigger than dinner plates  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
  
Da-da-da ...  
  
Belligerent ghouls  
Run Manchester schools  
  
Spineless bastards all ...  
  
Sir leads the troops  
Jealous of youth  
Same old jokes since 1902  
  
He does the military two-step  
Down the nape of my neck  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
Give up life  
As a bad mistake  
  
Please excuse me from gym  
I've got this terrible cold coming on  
He grabs and devours  
He kicks me in the showers  
Kicks me in the showers  
And he grabs and devours  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay...  
  
Da-da-da ...

Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty,  
Put me on the train for London Town,  
Take me anywhere,  
Drop me anywhere,  
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham  
But I don't care,  
I should like to see my...  
  
I don't bless them  
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes  
Hemmed in like a boar between arches  
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling  
I'm truly sorry - but it sounds like a wonderful thing  
  
I said Charles, don't you ever crave  
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail  
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?  
Oh...  
And so, I checked all the registered historical facts  
And I was shocked into shame to discover  
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendant  
Of some old queen or other  
  
Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?  
  
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs  
I swear to God  
I swear : I never even knew what drugs were  
Oh...  
So, I broke into the palace  
With a sponge and a rusty spanner  
She said : "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"  
I said : "That's nothing - you should hear me play piano"  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron  
No-one talks about castration  
Oh...  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
Like love and law and poverty  
Oh, these are the things that kill me  
  
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But the rain that flattens my hair...  
Oh, these are the things that kill me  
  
All their lies about make-up and long hair, are still there  
  
Past the pub who saps your body  
And the church who'll snatch your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
Past the pub that wrecks your body  
And the church - all they want is your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely

Take me out tonight  
Where there's music and there's people  
And they're young and alive  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one  
Anymore  
  
Take me out tonight  
Because I want to see people and I  
Want to see life  
Driving in your car  
Oh, please don't drop me home  
Because it's not my home, it's their  
Home, and I'm welcome no more  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine  
  
Take me out tonight  
Take me anywhere, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
And in the darkened underpass  
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last  
(But then a strange fear gripped me and I  
Just couldn't ask)  
  
Take me out tonight  
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one,  
Oh, I haven't got one  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine  
  
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out

Punctured bicycle  
On a hillside desolate  
Will nature make a man of me yet?  
  
When in this charming car  
This charming man  
  
Why pamper life's complexity  
When the leather runs smooth  
On the passenger's seat?  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I haven't got a stitch to wear  
This man said "it's gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care"  
  
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said "return the ring"  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
  
I would go out tonight  
But I haven't got a stitch to wear  
This man said "it's gruesome  
That someone so handsome should care"  
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man  
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man  
  
Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy  
Who never knew his place  
He said "return the ring"  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things  
He knows so much about these things

In a river the color of lead  
Immerse the baby's head  
Wrap her up in the News Of The World  
Dump her on a doorstep, girl  
  
This night has opened my eyes  
And I will never sleep again  
You kicked and cried like a bullied child  
A grown man of twenty-five  
  
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills  
But he didn't and he never will  
Oh, save your life  
Because you've only got one  
  
The dream has gone  
But the baby is real  
Oh, you did a good thing  
She could have been a poet  
  
Or, she could have been a fool  
Oh, you did a bad thing  
And I'm not happy  
And I'm not sad  
  
A shoeless child on a swing  
Reminds you of your own again  
She took away your troubles  
Oh, but then again  
  
She left pain  
So, please save your life  
Because you've only got one  
The dream has gone  
  
But the baby is real  
Oh, you did a good thing  
She could have been a poet  
Or, she could have been a fool  
  
Oh, you did a bad thing  
And I'm not happy  
And I'm not sad  
Oh...  
  
And I'm not happy  
And I'm not sad  
Oh...  
And I'm not happy  
  
And I'm not sad

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
'Cause you're evil  
And you lie  
And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad  
(But I won't cry)  
  
Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually it's Nothing  
Surely you're happy  
It should be this way ?  
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"  
And : "May the lines sag, may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight"  
  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
'Cause you're evil  
And you lie  
And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad  
(But I won't cry)  
  
Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually it's Nothing  
Surely you're happy  
It should be this way ?  
I said "No"  
And then I shot myself  
So, drink, drink, drink  
And be ill tonight  
  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Oh, unhappy birthday  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind

Oh...  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
Oh...  
  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
Oh, message received  
Loud and clear  
Loud and clear  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
For message received  
Loud and clear  
Loud and clear  
Message received  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
  
I wear black on the outside  
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside  
I wear black on the outside  
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside  
  
And if I seem a little strange  
Well, that's because I am  
If I seem a little strange  
That's because I am  
  
But I know that you would like me  
If only you could see me  
If only you could meet me  
  
Oh...  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
Mmm...  
Oh...

I was minding my business  
Lifting some lead off  
The roof of the Holy Name church  
It was worthwhile living a laughable life  
To set my eyes on the blistering sight  
Of a Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
A scanty bit of a thing  
With a decorative ring  
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose  
As Rose collects the money in a canister  
Who comes sliding down the bannister ?  
The Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
The monkish monsignor  
With a head full of plaster  
Said : "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again  
My God!  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh...  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh...  
  
The next day in the pulpit  
With freedom and ease  
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again and again and again  
  
In the fabric of a tutu  
Any man could get used to  
And I am the living sign  
And I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign  
Sign  
I am a living sign

Well I wonder  
Do you hear me when you sleep ?  
I hoarsely cry  
Oh...  
  
Well I wonder  
Do you see me when we pass ?  
I half die...  
Oh...  
  
Please keep me in mind  
Please keep me in mind  
  
Gasping - but somehow still alive  
This is the fierce last stand of all I am  
  
Gasping - dying - but somehow still alive  
This is the final stand of all I am  
  
Please keep me in mind  
  
Well I wonder  
Well I wonder  
Please keep me in mind  
Keep me in mind  
Keep me in mind

All men have secrets and here is mine  
So let it be known  
For we have been through hell and high tide  
I think I can rely on you...  
And yet you start to recoil  
Heavy words are so lightly thrown  
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you  
  
So, what difference does it make?  
So, what difference does it make?  
It makes none  
But now you have gone  
And you must be looking very old tonight  
  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied, and why?  
Because you asked me to!  
But now you make me feel so ashamed  
Because I've only got two hands  
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh  
  
So, what difference does it make?  
Oh, what difference does it make?  
Oh, it makes none  
But now you have gone  
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight  
  
Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole, and then I lied  
Just because you asked me to  
But now you know the truth about me  
You won't see me anymore  
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh  
  
But no more apologies  
No more, no more apologies  
Oh, I'm too tired  
I'm so sick and tired  
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today  
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh  
  
Oh, my sacred one...  
Oh...

What she said :  
"How come someone hasn't noticed  
That I'm dead  
And decided to bury me?  
God knows, I'm ready!"  
La-la-la...  
  
What she said was sad  
But then, all the rejection she's had  
To pretend to be happy  
Could only be idiocy  
La-la-la...  
  
What she said was not for the job or  
Lover that she never had  
Oh...  
No no no...  
  
What she read  
All heady books  
She'd sit and prophesise  
(It took a tattooed boy from  
Birkenhead  
To really really open her eyes)  
  
What she read  
All heady books  
She'd sit and prophesise  
(It took a tattooed boy from  
Birkenhead  
To really really open her eyes)  
  
What she said :  
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an  
Early death  
And I need to cling to something!"  
  
What she said :  
"I smoke 'cause I'm hoping for an  
Early death  
And I need to cling to something!"  
No no no no...

"Um ... this song was written by ... erm, erm..."  
What would you sell?  
Loose glasses and suit  
Heart and soul  
Won't wear out  
  
That's not enough!  
I wonder what's inside  
Fish fillet knife  
Can cut  
Right through my eye...  
  
I'm looking for some words  
To call my own  
Worn-out phrases  
And a hand-me-down  
  
They'll knock me  
Under where I stand  
Sad on his back  
In a corned beef pan  
  
Going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the rust inside...  
  
This is the way...  
Franken-star is born  
  
Bits and pieces  
Others have worn  
All held together by a management glue  
Too much glue  
Watch the stars turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
  
I'm going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the halls of rust  
Eeh...  
  
I, I, I, I, I...  
Thank you...

As merry as the days were long  
I was right and you were wrong  
  
Back at the old grey school  
I would win and you would lose  
  
But you've got everything now  
You've got everything now  
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life  
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life  
  
No, I've never had a job  
Because I've never wanted one  
  
I've seen you smile  
But I've never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor?  
I cannot say...oh  
  
You are your mother's only son  
And you're a desperate one  
Oh...  
  
But I don't want a lover  
I just want to be seen...oh...in the back of your car  
  
A friendship sadly lost?  
Well this is true...and yet, it's false  
Oh...  
  
But did I ever tell you, by the way?  
I never did like your face  
  
But you've got everything now  
You've got everything now  
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life  
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life  
  
No, I've never had a job  
Because I'm too shy  
  
I've seen you smile  
But I've never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor ?  
I cannot say...oh  
  
Oh...  
You are your mother's only son  
And you're a desperate one  
Oh...  
  
But I don't want a lover  
I just want to be tied... oh...to the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
Oh...
