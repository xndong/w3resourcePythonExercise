My life is changing in so many ways  
I don't know who to trust anymore  
There's a shadow running through my days  
Like a beggar going from door to door.  
  
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid  
Find a place nearby for her to stay.  
Just someone to keep my house clean,  
Fix my meals and go away.  
  
A maid. A man needs a maid.  
A maid.  
  
It's hard to make that change  
When life and love turns strange.  
And old.  
  
To give a love, you gotta live a love.  
To live a love, you gotta be "part of"  
When will I see you again?  
  
A while ago somewhere I don't know when  
I was watching a movie with a friend.  
I fell in love with the actress.  
She was playing a part that I could understand.  
  
A maid. A man needs a maid.  
A maid.  
  
When will I see you again?

The fruit of love was in the future  
Around the corner and over the hill  
The act of love was slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
  
The holy war was slowly building  
Heroes leaving for the great crusade  
Seek reward in the ever after  
Ever after  
Ever after  
  
Don't want to have to lose you baby  
Don't want to have to take you back  
You know I'll never lose you baby  
Abuse you baby  
Use you baby  
  
You know I'll always help you baby  
But I just can't do that  
I know I said I'd help you baby  
Here's my wallet  
Call me sometime  
  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
  
The fruit of love was in the future  
Around the corner and over the hill  
The act of love was slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love

Ain't it the truth  
Ain't it the truth, now, baby  
Ain't it the truth, now  
What I say?  
  
Eat watermelon  
Eat peaches and cream  
Eat ripe tomatoes  
You know what I mean.  
  
Ain't it the truth  
Ain't it the truth, now, baby  
Ain't it the truth, now  
What I say?  
  
Your majesty  
Your curvaceousness  
Your highness  
Your soulfulness.  
  
Make love to me, babe  
Make love to me  
Make me feel all right, now  
Make me feel so good.

Well, they say that Santa Fe is less than ninety miles away,  
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car.  
Oh, Albuquerque.  
  
I've been flyin' down the road, and I've been starvin' to be alone,  
And independent from the scene that I've known.  
Albuquerque.  
  
So I'll stop when I can, find some fried eggs and country ham.  
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am.  
Oh, Albuquerque,  
Albuquerque.

"There must be some kind of way out of here"  
Said a joker to the thief  
"There is too much confusion, I can't get no relief  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, ploughmen dig my earth  
None of them along the line, nobody up it is worth"  
  
"No reason to get excited"  
The thief he kindly spoke  
"There are many here among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
But you and I have been through that and it is not our fate  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late"  
  
All along the watchtower, princess kept the view  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too  
Outside in the cold distance a wildcat did growl  
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl

Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
There's a moon so fine  
There for you, my Amber Jean.  
  
Still some lines  
That should get crossed  
Still some coins  
That might be tossed  
Still some love  
That hasn't been lost  
There for you, my Amber Jean.  
  
Amber Jean, oh, Amber Jean,  
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen.  
  
Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
There's a moon so fine  
There for you, my Amber Jean.

Back in the old folky days  
The air was magic when we played.  
The riverboat was rockin' in the rain  
Midnight was the time for the raid.  
  
Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela,  
They tore you down and plowed you under.  
You're only real with your make-up on  
How could I see you and stay too long?  
  
All along the Navajo Trail,  
Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.  
Waitresses are cryin' in the rain  
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?  
  
Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids  
Sure ain't happy, neither are the kids.  
She needs someone that she can scream at  
And I'm such a heel for makin' her feel so bad.  
  
I guess I'll call it sickness gone  
It's hard to say the meaning of this song.  
An ambulance can only go so fast  
It's easy to get buried in the past  
When you try to make a good thing last.  
  
I saw today in the entertainment section  
There's room at the top for private detection.  
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter,  
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.  
  
So all you critics sit alone  
You're no better than me for what you've shown.  
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams  
We could get together for some scenes.  
  
I never knew a man could tell so many lies  
He had a different story for every set of eyes.  
How can he remember who he's talkin' to?  
'Cause I know it ain't me, and I hope it isn't you.  
  
Well, I'm up in T.O. keepin' jive alive,  
And out on the corner it's half past five.  
But the subways are empty  
And so are the cafes.  
  
Except for the Farmer's Market  
And I still can hear him say:  
You're all just pissin' in the wind  
You don't know it but you are.  
  
And there ain't nothin' like a friend  
Who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind.  
  
I never knew a man could tell so many lies  
He had a different story for every set of eyes  
How can he remember who he's talking to?  
Cause I know it ain't me, and hope it isn't you.

I used to see you  
On every T. V.  
Your smiling face  
Looked back at me.  
I used to see you  
On every T. V.  
Your smiling face  
Looked back at me.  
Then they caught you  
With the girl next door,  
People's money  
Piled on the floor,  
Accusations  
That you try to deny,  
Revelations  
And rumors begin to fly.  
  
Now you think about  
Reaching out  
Maybe get some help  
From above.  
Now you think about  
Reaching out  
Maybe get some help  
From above.  
Reporters crowd around  
Your house.  
Going through your garbage  
Like a pack of hounds,  
Speculating what they  
May find out,  
It don't matter now,  
You're all washed up.  
  
You wake up in the middle  
Of the night.  
Your sheets are wet  
And your face is white,  
You tried to make  
A good thing last,  
How could something so good,  
Go bad, so fast?  
  
American dream, American dream  
American dream, American dream.  
  
Don't know when  
Things went wrong,  
Might have been when you  
Were young and strong.  
Don't know when  
Things went wrong,  
Might have been when you  
Were young and strong.

Some see life as a broken promise  
Some see life as an endless fight  
They think they live in the age of darkness  
They think they live in the age of light  
  
It's an angry world  
And everything is gonna be all right  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
  
Some see life as hope eternal  
Some see life as a business plan  
Some wish some will go to hell's inferno  
For screwing with their life in Freedom Land  
  
It's an angry world  
For the business man and the fisherman  
It's an angry world  
And no doubt everything will go as planned  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
Yeah, it's an angry world

Are there any more  
Real cowboys  
Left out in these hills?  
Will the fire hit the iron  
One more time?  
And will one more  
Dusty pick-up  
Coming rolling down the road  
With a load of feed  
Before the sun gets high?  
Well, I hope that  
Working cowboy never dies.  
  
Not the one  
That's snortin' cocaine  
When the honky-tonk's all closed  
But the one  
That prays for more rain  
Heaven knows  
That the good feed  
Brings the money  
And the money buys the clothes  
Not the diamond sequins  
Shining on tv  
But the kind the  
Working cowboy really needs.  
  
Are there any more  
Country families  
Still working hand in hand  
Trying hard to stay together  
And make a stand?  
While the rows and rows of houses  
Come creepin' up on the land  
Where the cattle graze and  
An old grey barn still stands  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land?  
  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land?

Bad news is come to town  
He's walking  
Three feet off the ground  
He's ordering another round.  
Bound by his own ideas,  
Lost, doesn't know  
Where she is found.  
  
Bad news is fighting mad  
He went and lost  
The biggest prize  
He ever had  
But a prizefighter  
Can't be sad  
When he smiles under  
Golden lights and lamps  
Taking daylight fights  
Again and again.

One mornin' when I was ridin'  
In my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin' down  
My eyes caught the color  
As it lead me down the road  
Dippin' and bobbin' in the sun  
I've never seen that blue before  
'Cept in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
So I followed all the way  
To the top of the hill  
That's where she kept on climbin' lord  
Someday I will  
  
[Chorus]  
Beautiful bluebird  
See how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window  
Where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird  
I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Well it kind of struck me funny  
Sort of made me smile  
After all these years on this old road  
How God could show me somethin'  
Never say a word  
There's so much that I don't know  
I've never seen that blue before  
Except in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
I followed all the way to the top of the hill  
That's where she kept on climbin' lord  
And someday I will  
  
[Chorus: x2]

One morning when I was ridin' in my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin' down  
My eyes caught the color as it led me down the road  
Dippin' and bobbin' in the sun  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
I've never seen that blue before except in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
And just like a lover I watched her fly away  
And that's what I remember now  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you

Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
I'm singing out  
The same old song  
Can't go back  
The way I started from  
The road goes on and on  
Won't you help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Take my way on home  
Help me make my way on home  
After Berlin.  
  
Lights are shining  
In the German sky  
Cosmic walls  
Between the moon and I  
Don't know where I started from  
So won't you take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Take me, take me,  
Just the way I am  
Ah, take me, just the way I am  
After Berlin.  
  
All day cruising  
Down the corridor  
Seeing things  
I never seen before  
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin  
Where they lock you out  
Or lock you in  
Won't you save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
Save me, save me,  
From the final day  
Save me from the final day  
After Berlin.  
  
Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
I'm singing out  
The same old song  
I can't go back  
The way I used to go  
The road goes on and on  
Won't you help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me,  
Find my way back home  
Won't you help me  
Make my way on home  
After Berlin.  
  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me.  
Help me, help me,  
Help me, help me.

Been burned and with both feet on the ground,  
I've learned that it's painful comin' down.  
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay.  
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',  
No time left and I know I'm losin'.  
  
Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down,  
Crashed, and my ears can't hear a sound.  
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay.  
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',  
No time left and I know I'm losin'.  
  
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',  
No time left and I know I'm losin'.  
  
Burned and with both feet on the ground.  
I've learned that it's painful comin' down.  
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay.  
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',  
No time left and I know I'm losin'.

I am a lonely visitor.  
I came to late to cause a stir,  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal.  
I hardly slept the night you wept  
Our secret's safe and still well kept  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul.  
  
Traffic cops are all color blind.  
People steal from their own kind.  
Evening comes to early for a stroll.  
Down neon streets the streaker streaks.  
The speaker speaks,  
But the truth still leaks,  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got it,  
Soul.  
  
The podium rocks in the crowded waves.  
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves  
That went down long before  
He played this role  
For the hotel queens and the magazines,  
Test tube genes and slot machines  
Where even Richard Nixon got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got it,  
Soul.  
  
Hospitals have made him cry,  
But there's always a free way in his eye,  
Though his beach just got  
Too crowded for his stroll.  
Roads stretch out like healthy veins,  
And wild gift horses strain the reins,  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul.  
  
I am a lonely visitor.  
I came to late to cause a stir,  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal.

Daylight breaks and I go to bed  
And I find myself worryin' about things you said  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
Well, I lost my job thinkin' about you  
Now there's another man workin' in my place  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
Well, my money's gone and so are you  
My friends all tell me I have been a fool  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.

Silk scarf and a napkin hidden in a drawer  
Two hundred bucks in an envelope labeled Lenore  
  
"Maybe she shouldn't see this  
She should never know"  
Said the widow's best friend Ann  
"I'll just take it and go  
I'll give it her the money later  
Say it was in his shoe  
That way she'll never find out  
That'll do"  
  
"Carmichael was a credit to the force  
In everything he did  
It's like we've got a big hole in our side  
Where he fit  
If any of you officers would like to say a word  
Now would be the time to be heard"  
"Thank you chief, I sure would  
He was a partner of mine  
He was always very careful  
Played it straight down the line"  
  
One by one the officers spoke  
And the service drew to a close  
He had no living relatives but his wife-who never showed  
She just couldn't face the men--they all understood  
They got in their cars and drove home  
As directly as they could  
  
"Carmichael, you asshole!"  
The new widow sobbed beneath her vale  
"Shot down in the line of duty  
Is this how justice never fails?  
I wish that things were better  
When we said goodbye today  
But we had our share of good times though along the way  
  
Remember 'Hey mister Las Vegas-You used to be so cool!'?  
We met Wayne Newton down on Pebble Beach and you acted like a fool  
But we both just couldn't stop laughing-it seemed so funny to us  
We left our luggage back in the room and almost missed the bus  
That was a great vacation--maybe the best of all  
But goddamn it, Carmichael, you're dead now and I'm talking to the wall"  
  
The force got back to normal  
Carmichael was replaced  
For one year nobody parked a car in Carmichael's space

I want to live with a cinnamon girl  
I could be happy the rest of my life  
With a cinnamon girl.  
  
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night  
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,  
My cinnamon girl.  
  
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow  
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows  
For his cinnamon girl.  
  
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night  
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,  
My cinnamon girl.  
  
Pa sent me money now  
I'm gonna make it somehow  
I need another chance  
You see your baby loves to dance  
Yeah...yeah...yeah.

Cars and trucks  
Fly by me on the corner  
But I'm all right  
Standin' proud before the signal  
When I see the light  
I know I'm more than just a number.  
And I stand before you  
Or else we just don't see the other  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age.  
  
Bikes and vans  
Fly by me on the desert  
But I'm all right  
Standing out here in the hot sun  
When I see the light  
I feel like more than just a number  
And I stand before you  
Or else we just don't see the other  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age.  
  
Precious metal lines  
Molded into highways  
Running through me  
So microscopically  
Days and nights  
Weeks and months and seasons  
Rolling through me  
So chronologically.  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age.  
  
I need you  
To let me know that there's a heartbeat  
Let it pound and pound  
And I'll be flying like a free bird  
And you need me  
Like ugly needs a mirror  
And day by day  
This horizon's getting clearer  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age.

He came dancing across the water  
With his galleons and guns  
Looking for the new world  
In that palace in the sun.  
  
On the shore lay Montezuma  
With his coca leaves and pearls  
In his halls he often wondered  
With the secrets of the worlds.  
  
And his subjects gathered 'round him  
Like the leaves around a tree  
In their clothes of many colors  
For the angry gods to see.  
  
And the women all were beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
They offered life in sacrifice  
So that others could go on.  
  
Hate was just a legend  
And war was never known  
The people worked together  
And they lifted many stones.  
  
They carried them to the flat lands  
And they died along the way  
But they built up with their bare hands  
What we still can't do today.  
  
And I know she's living there  
And she loves me to this day  
I still can't remember when  
Or how I lost my way.  
  
He came dancing across the water  
Cortez, Cortez  
What a killer.

Hello cowgirl in the sand  
Is this place at your command?  
Can I stay here for a while?  
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game  
  
Hello ruby in the dust  
Has your band begun to rust?  
After all the sin we had  
I was hopin' that we'd turn bad  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game  
  
Hello woman of my dreams  
Is this not the way it seems?  
Purple words on a gray background  
To be a woman and to be turned down  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

Well, the cop made the showdown  
He was sure he was right  
He had all of the lowdown  
From the bank heist last night  
His best friend was the robber  
And his wife was a thief  
All the children were killers  
They couldn't get no relief  
The bungalow was surrounded  
When a voice loud and clear  
Said, Come on out with your hands up  
Or we'll blow you out of here.  
There was a face in the window  
The TV cameras rolled  
Then they cut to the announcer  
And the story was told.  
  
The artist looked at the producer  
The producer sat back  
He said, What we have got here  
Is a perfect track  
But we don't have a vocal  
And we don't have a song  
If we could get these things accomplished  
Nothin' else could go wrong.  
So he balanced the ashtray  
As he picked up the phone  
And said, Send me a songwriter  
Who's drifted far from home  
And make sure that he's hungry  
Make sure he's alone  
Send me a cheeseburger  
And a new Rolling Stone.  
Yeah.  
  
There's still crime in the city,  
Said the cop on the beat,  
I don't know if I can stop it  
I feel like meat on the street  
They paint my car like a target  
I take my orders from fools  
Meanwhile some kid blows my head off  
Well, I play by their rules  
That's why I'm doin' it my way  
I took the law in my hands  
  
So here I am in the alleyway  
A wad of cash in my pants  
I get paid by a ten year old  
He says he looks up to me  
There's still crime in the city  
But it's good to be free.  
Yeah.  
  
Now I come from a family  
That has a broken home  
Sometimes I talk to Daddy  
On the telephone  
When he says that he loves me  
I know that he does  
But I wish I could see him  
I wish I knew where he was  
But that's the way all my friends are  
Except maybe one or two  
Wish I could see him this weekend  
Wish I could walk in his shoes  
But now I'm doin' my own thing  
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad  
Although my home has been broken  
It's the best home I ever had  
Yeah.  
  
Well, I keep gettin' younger  
My life's been funny that way  
Before I ever learned to talk  
I forgot what to say  
I sassed back to my mom  
I sassed back to my teacher  
I got thrown out of Bible school  
For sassin' back at the preacher  
Then I grew up to be a fireman  
Put out every fire in town  
Put out anything smokin'  
But when I put the hose down  
The judge sent me to prison  
He gave me life without parole  
Wish I never put the hose down  
Wish I never got old.

Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Well, old man river just keeps on rollin'  
On down the line  
Like my tears just keep on flowin'  
All the time  
Can't you hear me cry.  
  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Well, somewhere there's a rainbow for me,  
I know it's my time  
I am getting so tired  
Of standing in this light  
Can't you hear me cry.  
  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo,  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, boo, hoo,  
Boo, hoo, hoo, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry.

Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
Who's gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise?  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
  
You say that all your life  
You've been a free bird  
There's been nobody over you  
And you always have to  
Have the last word  
Because one feels better than two.  
  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
Who's gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise?  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
  
You say your life's  
Like riding on a fast train  
It's easy to see far away  
But right up close  
It's just a blurry haze  
Flyin' by from day to day.  
  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?

My old dad went a walkin' one day,  
Pushing tall weeds right outta his way,  
My old dad went a walkin' one day,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt,  
Daddy went a walkin' just to feel the earth,  
Got a little dirty but that's all right,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road,  
You've got to let him go,  
Old man crossing the road,  
He's feelin' fine  
  
Daddy went a ridin' in his old car,  
Took the dog with him 'cause it ain't too far,  
Daddy went ridin' in his old car,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Brown leather boots and an old straw hat,  
Daddy's getting wood with the barnyard cat,  
Got a little dirty but that's all right,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road,  
You've got to let him go,  
Old man crossing the road,  
He's feelin' fine  
  
Mama's waiting  
At the top of the hill,  
They'll be laughing,  
Oh the stories they'll tell...  
When he holds her  
In his arms again,  
They'll be sweethearts  
With time on their hands

Never thought love  
had a rainbow on it  
Used to think a cloud  
was a nightmare  
That was up until  
I first met you  
Now I go around  
hoping you care.  
  
Dance, dance,  
feel it all around you  
Dance, dance, dance,  
Never thought love  
had a rainbow on it  
See the girl dance  
See the girl dance.  
  
Mississippi mud  
never touched her fingers  
California sand  
lies in her hand  
Love her more than life  
as the daylight lingers  
Early in the morning  
I'll be her man.  
  
Dance, dance,  
feel it all around you  
Dance, dance, dance,  
Mississippi mud  
never touched her fingers  
See the girl dance  
See the girl dance.

Danger bird, he flies alone  
And he rides the wind  
Back to his home  
Although his wings  
Have turned to stone  
  
And we used  
To be so calm  
Now I think  
About you  
All day long  
'Cause you've been  
With another man  
Here you are  
And here I am.  
  
That's the moment  
That he cracked  
Long ago in the  
Museum with his  
Friends.  
  
The jailbird takes the raps  
And he finds himself  
Spread-eagled on the tracks  
But the training that he learned  
Will get him nowhere fast.  
  
And I know we  
Should be free  
But freedom's just  
A prison to me  
'Cause I lied  
To keep it kind  
When I left you  
Far behind.  
  
With the rain  
Pounding on his  
Back he recalls  
The moment that  
He cracked long  
Ago in the museum  
With his friends.  
And like those  
Memories the rain  
Keeps pounding  
Down, down, down.  
  
And though these wings  
Have turned to stone  
I can fly fly fly away.  
Watch me fly above the city  
Like a shadow on the sky.  
Fly, fly, fly.

People say don't rock the boat,  
Let things go their own way  
Ideas that once seem so right,  
Now have gotten hard to say  
I wish I could talk to you,  
You could talk to me  
'Cause there's very few of us left  
My friend  
From the days that used to be.  
  
Seem like such a simple thing  
To follow one's own dream  
But possessions and concession  
Are not often what they seem  
They drag you down  
And load you down  
In disguise of security.  
But we never had  
To make those deals  
In the days that used to be.  
  
Talk to me, my long lost friend,  
Tell me how you are  
Are you happy with  
Your circumstance,  
Are you driving a new car  
Does it get you where you wanna go,  
With a seven year warranty  
Or just another  
Hundred thousand miles away  
From days that used to be.

On the lake,  
The deep forbidden lake,  
The old boats go gliding by,  
And the leaves  
Are falling from the trees  
And landing on the logs and I  
See the turtles  
Heading for the bog  
And falling off the log.  
They make the water splash,  
And feeling no backlash,  
They climb the happy banks.  
  
On the boats,  
The old and creaky boats,  
The shoreline goes gliding by,  
And the wind,  
There was a dying breeze,  
Is making the banners fly.  
See the colors,  
Floating in the sky,  
The pride of the captain's eye,  
As he glides  
His slender craft inside  
And opens up the door.  
  
On the coast,  
The long and tempting coast,  
The cards on the table lie,  
And a speech,  
So eloquent in reach,  
Was made by a passerby,  
Passing by the way between  
Here and left behind.  
And it ripples through the crowds  
Who run and cast their doubts  
In the deep forbidden lake.  
  
Yes, it echoes through the crowds  
Who run and cast their doubts  
In the deep forbidden lake.

Got a woman that loves me  
And I love her so  
But she's all dressed up now  
With nowhere to go.  
  
All our old hang-outs  
Are boarded up and closed  
Or bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.  
  
But things ain't that bad  
We still got the kids  
We're goin' out to the movies  
Right after this.  
  
Goin' back to school  
Savin' up my tuition  
Gonna rewrite all the rules  
On the old blackboard.  
  
'Cause it seems things today  
There ain't no magic in 'em  
They don't cut the grade  
Like they used to.  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.  
  
Is there anybody out there  
With a voice loud and clear  
Gonna sing all the words  
We all want to hear.  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.

Well the red light shines  
On the streets of hate  
Where the devil dines  
Who knows what he ate  
  
"It's a simple thing  
Trying to stay afloat"  
The captain said  
Without his boat  
  
Some things are getting better  
Other things a little worse  
It's a situation  
Much like a curse  
  
"It's the devil's sidewalk  
It's the devil's door  
I've tried to avoid it"  
Said the captain of the shore  
  
There's a garden growing  
And a million weeds  
With no way of knowing  
Who's done which deed  
  
"That's an honest tale"  
Said the helmsman to the mate  
"About a woman delicious  
And a matter of fate"  
  
Big wheel keep rollin'  
Down on me  
"One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free"  
  
John Lennon said that  
And "I believe in love"  
But I believe in action  
When push comes to shove  
  
"Who cares what you believe,"  
Said the captain, amazed  
"If you stood in my shoes  
Your eyes would be glazed"  
  
So, my fair damsel  
Won't you take your leave  
Are you headed for the country?  
Where you wear the greensleeves  
  
And the children laugh  
And the old folks sing  
And the church bell tolls  
For a miraculous thing  
  
Where the big red furnace  
Just blooms and glows  
Where the big heart beats  
Where the big wheel rolls

Old man lying by the side of the road  
With the lorries rolling by,  
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load  
And the building scrape the sky,  
Cold wind ripping down the allay at dawn  
And the morning paper flies,  
Dead man lying by the side of the road  
With the daylight in his eyes.  
  
Don't let it bring you down  
It's only castles burning,  
Find someone who's turning  
And you will come around.  
  
Blind man running through the light of the night  
With an answer in his hand,  
Come on down to the river of sight  
And you can really understand,  
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain,  
Can you hear the sirens moan?  
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane,  
If you're walking home alone.  
  
Don't let it bring you down  
It's only castles burning,  
Just find someone who's turning  
And you will come around.  
  
Don't let it bring you down  
It's only castles burning,  
Just find someone who's turning  
And you will come around.

Young Pegi just died today  
Young Pegi just died today  
And I guess  
Nobody even knows the case  
But the way the story goes  
She just ran out of clothes  
No will this world  
Just for the peg down  
Last words, can't talk  
And then she wrote.  
  
Some people can't stand no rain  
Some people can't stand no rain  
When it's cloudy outside  
You can't see the sun  
But on a bright and sunny day  
The people all go away  
Except one  
Oh no don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Don't see no tears around me  
Don't see no tears around me  
I don't take too much stock  
In the things people say  
I'm not saying that they're wrong  
They've just  
Been standing around too long  
Gone bad,  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Can't ride my broom no more  
Can't ride my broom no more  
'Cause the landlady's taken  
To sweeping the floor  
I guess I'll go back to my place  
And occupy a little space  
John Doe,  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
The streets are crammed, can't walk  
Might find somebody and talk  
I can't find nobody who  
Say boo, guess who  
'Cause that street  
Is paved with aires  
And everybody is putting on theirs  
Can't breathe  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
He's standing outside my door  
He's standing outside my door  
But he won't ring the bell  
And he's just to scared to knock  
And he's puzzled  
And he's young  
And he's doing what's  
Already been done  
One more  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright  
O yeah, I'm alright.  
  
Oh no, don't pity me babe  
I know I'm alright.

There's just one thing  
I'm askin' of you  
There's just one thing,  
Baby, I'm askin' of you  
Don't ever leave me, baby  
No matter what you do  
There's just one thing  
I'm askin' of you.  
  
Don't take your love away from me  
Don't take your love away from me  
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby  
How wrong you would be  
Don't take your love away from me.  
  
When I make a promise,  
You can bet that it's true  
When I make a promise,  
Baby, you can bet that it's true  
So put your chips down, baby  
Empty your pockets, too  
'Cause when I make a promise,  
You can bet that it's true.  
  
Don't take your love away from me  
Don't take your love away from me  
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby  
How wrong you would be  
Don't take your love away from me.

Back in the country, living on the Double E  
In the sunshine of her life  
There's already a young fellow but Mom and Daddy won't let her leave  
Mom and Poppa won't let her go  
  
But when they go out dancin'  
She breaks out on her own  
She's hot enough to burn the house down  
But Mom and Poppa don't know  
  
When Edith and Earl renamed the Double E  
They nearly made history  
The locals rose up, some of them were mad as hell  
Cause it used to be the Double L  
  
Change comes slow in the country  
When you're new there's a lot of distrust  
Years fly by uneventful  
Memories turn to dust  
  
Meanwhile Granny has got her bright colors on  
And the sun's shinin' in her eyes  
Cruisin' by the bars and honky-tonks where she met Grandpa  
And caught that young man's eye  
  
Dusty white El Dorado  
Cruisin' through the trees  
Slippin' through the shadows  
Of what used to be  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Grandma's okay, not the same since Grandpa's gone  
She's living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love

Come to see her in the river  
She'll be there to wave to you.  
In the hope that you'll forgive her,  
She will join you there...  
  
Find out that now was  
the answer to answers,  
that you gave later.  
She did the things that  
we both did before now,  
but who forgave her.  
  
Now you see how down you've fallen,  
Now you hear your conscious call.  
Thank yourself alone for stallin',  
I'm not there to call...  
  
Call me a fool cause  
I need her, and see her,  
but now you're down.  
Something inside you  
will tell you I'm wise to  
what you're spreadin' round.  
  
If I could stand to see her cryin',  
I would tell her not to care.  
When she learns of all your lyin',  
Would she join you there...  
  
Find out that now was  
the answer to answers,  
that you gave later.

In the crystal ball  
The gypsy sees the villa  
The riders on the hill  
The fire in the fields  
She sees the mission bell  
Swinging in the silence  
Now the shooting starts  
The bullets pierce the hearts  
The senoritas crying at the well.  
  
Up in the Gold Hotel  
The money hits the table  
The heavies all are there  
That's why the deal's goin' down  
Beautiful women all dressed in  
Diamonds and sable  
Down upon the street  
Beside a garbage heap  
A Mariachi band begins to play.  
  
Somewhere a blues guitar  
Plays echoes in the alleyway  
The Tijuana dawn  
Claims another day  
The golden sun  
Rises on the runway  
The pilot understands  
The money changes hands  
Inside the jet the briefcase snaps. Goodbye.  
  
In Eldorado town  
There lives a great bullfighter  
His eyes are screaming blue  
His hair is red as blood  
And when the gate goes up  
The crowd gets so excited  
And he comes dancin' out  
Dressed in gold lame  
He kills the bull and lives another day.

When you hear that rooster crowing  
In the dawn, in the dawn  
There's really no way of knowing  
What goes on, what goes on  
  
The world is full of questions  
Some are answered, some are not  
The only faith you're keepin'  
Is the faith that you still got  
  
I love the sound of laughter  
And music in the air  
And in the ever after  
I know it's always there  
  
A man had many boxes  
And he liked them quite a lot  
But they would not be opened  
Cause the value would be shot  
  
Sometimes when I go walkin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
That's where I do my prayin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
  
The world is full of answers  
Some are right, some are wrong  
The one that I believe in is a wish in a song  
  
I love to see you smilin'  
And hear your voice so fair  
And in the ever after  
I know you're always there

Know you got to run,  
Know you got to hide  
Still there is a great life  
Lingerin' deep within your eyes.  
  
Open up, open up, baby let me in.  
  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself, my friend.  
  
Everybody, I love you  
Everybody, I do  
  
Though your heart is in anger  
I need your love to get through  
When I tell you I love you  
You can believe that it's true  
  
Everybody, I love you  
Everybody, I do.

I think I'd like to go  
Back home  
And take it easy  
There's a woman that  
I'd like to get to know  
Living there  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What it's like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this day-to-day  
Running around,  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere.  
  
Everybody, everybody knows  
Everybody knows.  
  
Every time I think about  
Back home  
It's cool and breezy  
I wish that I could be there  
Right now  
Just passing time.  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What it's like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this day-to-day  
Running around,  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere.  
  
Everybody, everybody knows  
Everybody knows.

If you're looking for me  
You'll find me resting in the shade  
Of the mountains and trees  
Beneath the cool summer breeze  
And I don't mind if you stay  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
People talking to me  
Someone saying that I'm not the same  
That's not so easy to be  
But when I'll learn to be free  
I wonder if I'll miss the pain  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
All I want you to know  
Is that I love you so much  
I can hardly stand it  
When everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  

Well I hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of a dying breed  
Living off the land  
And taking what he needs  
Don't say much for the future  
When a family can't survive  
I'd hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind.  
  
In the struggle for parity  
Not one man's voice can sound  
Cause the foundation  
Of the conglomerate  
Is firmly in the ground.  
Yeah, they want to feed the world  
But for power and for greed  
Then they'll cut off the supply  
Until they get what they need.  
  
Well I dreamed I saw a dust bowl  
Where the farmers used to live  
Earth was flying through the sky  
It had nothing left to give  
Tractors were burning  
On the Whitehouse lawn  
Just woke up one morning  
And the farmers all were gone  
  
I hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of a dying breed  
Living off the land  
And taking what he needs.  
Don't say much for the future  
When a family can't survive.  
I'd hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind.  
  
Don't say much for the future  
When a family can't survive.  
I'd hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind.

High on a balcony,  
Right where we used to be,  
This city dancing  
Like a sparkling sea.  
I wanna catch a wave,  
I wanna swim to shore.  
Walk on that same beach  
Like I did before.  
  
I really want the sun,  
Want the sun to rise,  
I really want  
To end the night.  
I really wanna feel,  
Wanna feel your love.  
I wanna feel your love.  
  
I think of our old friends,  
I count my enemies.  
I hear you tell me how  
I don't know love.  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna lay right down.  
Wish I was swimming  
In the sound of love.  
  
I really want the night,  
Want the night to end.  
I really want  
The sun to rise.  
I really wanna feel,  
Wanna feel your love.  
I wanna feel your love.  
  
And now the night is still,  
The mansion on the hill,  
The children sleeping  
In their endless dreams.  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
Feel your love,  
Feel your love.  
  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
I wanna feel your love,  
Feel your love,  
Feel your love.

I've been wrong before  
And I'll be there again  
I don't have any answers my friend  
Just this pile of old questions  
My memory left me here  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
I'm going' back to my house  
But I'm not goin' now  
It's too early to be leaving here, somehow  
Let me bore you with this story  
"How my lover let me down"  
While I borrow seeds of sadness  
From the ground.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
When I'm all done cultivatin'  
I'll be rockin' on the porch  
Tryin' to picture you and where you are  
And there'll be no hesitatin'  
When Cupid lights the torch  
With those headlights comin' down the hill  
Between the stars.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.

I told you babe once before  
Don't want you hangin'  
Around my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
I told you babe, you're no good,  
Don't want you  
Messin' up my neighborhood.  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder, babe  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
Ah, here's your  
Ticket for the coast,  
Start light,  
Leave here baby,  
Stay out of sight.  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
You better find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
I told you baby, once before  
Don't want you messin'  
Outside my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.

Back in the days of covered wagons  
A man had his own way  
Whether talkin' to a woman  
Or crossing the you. S. A.  
No telephones were ringing  
No angry words exchanged.  
I wish I was back in the saddle now  
Riding on the range.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.  
  
Well, I used to be so happy,  
When you gave good 'phone.  
I could call you up from anywhere  
For a little bit of home  
But now my heart is aching  
After every call  
By the way you talk you'd think  
You never gave good 'phone at all.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts.  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.

Today's the day our younger son  
Is goin' off to war  
Fightin' in the age old battle  
We've sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin' in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Church bells are ringin'  
As the families stand and wave  
Some of them are cryin'  
But the soldiers look so brave  
Lookin' straight ahead  
Like they know just where they're goin'  
Past the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Sister has her headphones on  
She hears the music blasting  
She sees here brother marchin' by  
Their bond is everlasting  
Listening to Bob Dylan singin'  
In 1963  
Watchin' the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
She sees the president speakin'  
On a flat-screen TV  
In the window of the old appliance store  
She turns to see her brother again  
But he's already walkin' past  
The flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Have you seen the flags of freedom?  
What color are they now?  
Do you think that you believe in yours  
More than they do theirs somehow?  
When you see the flags of freedom flyin'  
  
Todays' the day our younger son  
Is goin' off to war  
Fighting in the age old battle  
We've sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin' in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'

Is my world not falling down  
I'm in pieces on the ground  
And my eyes aren't open  
And I'm standing on my knees  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Turn me up or turn me down  
Turn me off or turn me round  
I wish I could have met you in a place  
Where we both belong  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you  
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child  
Sometimes I feel like a kid  
But baby, since I have changed  
I can't take nothing home  
City lights at a country fair  
Never shine but always glare  
If I'm bright enough to see you  
You're just too dark to care  
But if crying and holding on  
And flying on the ground is wrong  
Then I'm sorry to let you down  
But you're from my side of town  
And I miss you  

Well, I went with Mary Lou  
Tried Peggy Sue  
Had a date with Donna  
And Barbara Ann too  
But I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Well, I went out with Jenny  
Took out skinny Minnie  
Long tall Sally  
And short fat Fanny.  
But I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Did the bop with Miss Ann  
The swim with Mary Ann,  
The stroll with Betty Lou  
Screwed runaround Sue  
But she wasn't  
As good as Wanda,  
No, she'll never be  
As good as Wanda.  
I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.

Who put the palm over my blond?  
Who put all the tar on the morning sand?  
Who took everything from where it once was  
And put it where it was last seen?  
  
Fontainebleau, they painted it green  
Fontainebleau, for the well-to-do  
At the Fontainebleau.  
  
There's a palace in the gravy  
That's holding on and on and on  
Even after all the blue-haired ladies  
And the wheelchairs are gone.  
  
I guess the reason I'm so scared of it  
Is I stayed there once and I almost fit  
I left before I got out of it  
People were drownin' in their own  
  
Fontainebleau  
Fontainebleau, was that me?  
Fontainebleau, well I guess I'll see  
Fontainebleau.  
  
Fontainebleau, where the surfer works  
Fontainebleau, 'til the break of day  
Fontainebleau, 'cause it takes a shark  
Fontainebleau, to catch a wave at the Fontainebleau.

All through the lonesome night  
I tossed and I turned  
Lost in these dreams of you  
Since the day I learned  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
A fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
Fool for your love.  
  
Look how your eyes have changed,  
All the love has gone  
Where did I lose you babe,  
What did I do wrong  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
I'm a fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
Fool for your love.  
  
Now you won't say goodbye,  
But you don't want to stay  
I never thought that I  
Would lose you this way.  
  
A fool for your love.  
  
All through the lonesome night  
I tossed and I turned  
Lost in these dreams of you  
Since the day I learned  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
A fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
  
Fool for your love.  
A fool for your love,  
I hold on your love.  
I'm just a fool in love with you.  
  
I'm a fool, fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for you.

All the sailors with their seasick mamas  
Hear the sirens on the shore,  
Singin' songs for pimps with tailors  
Who charge ten dollars at the door.  
  
You can really learn a lot that way  
It will change you in the middle of the day.  
Though your confidence may be shattered,  
It doesn't matter.  
  
All the great explorers  
Are now in granite laid, (in Granite Lake?)  
Under white sheets for the great unveiling  
At the big parade.  
  
You can really learn a lot that way  
It will change you in the middle of the day.  
Though your confidence may be shattered,  
It doesn't matter.  
  
All the bush league batters  
Are left to die on the diamond.  
In the stands the home crowd scatters  
For the turnstiles,  
For the turnstiles,  
For the turnstiles.

Got a pot belly,  
It's not too big  
Gets in my way  
When I'm driving my rig  
  
Driving this country  
In a big old rig  
Things I've seen  
Mean a lot  
  
Friend has a pickup  
Drives his kid to school  
Then he takes his wife  
To beauty school  
  
Now she's doin' nails  
Gonna get a job  
Got a good teacher  
  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
I don't which way I'm gonna turn  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
  
About this year  
We salute the troops  
They're all still there  
In a fucking war  
It's no good  
Whose idea was that?  
  
I've got hope  
But you can't eat hope  
I'm not done  
Not giving up  
Not cashing in  
Too late  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
It's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
  
I'm a big rock star  
My sales have tanked  
But I still got you  
Thanks  
Download this  
Sounds like shit  
  
Keep on bloggin'  
'Til the power goes out  
Your battery's dead  
Twist and shout  
  
On the radio  
Those were the days  
Bring 'em back  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
Bailout coming but it's not for you  
  
Got my flat screen  
Got it repo'd now  
They picked it up  
Left a hole in the wall  
Last Saturday  
Missed the Raiders game  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do

Think I'll go out to Alberta  
Weather's good there in the fall  
I got some friends that I could go to working for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind  
If I ask you one more time  
But we've been through this a hundred times or more  
  
chorus: Four strong winds that blow lonely  
Seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change, Come what may.  
If all the good times are all gone  
Then I'm bound for movin' on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are lookin' good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare.  
But, by then it would be winter  
Not too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold 'way out there.

From Hank to Hendrix  
I walked these streets with you  
Here I am with this old guitar  
Doin' what I do.  
  
I always expected  
That you should see me through  
I never believed in much  
But I believed in you.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
From Marilyn to Madonna  
I always loved your smile  
Now we're headed for the big divorce  
California-style.  
  
I found myself singin'  
Like a long-lost friend  
The same thing that makes you live  
Can kill you in the end.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
Sometime it's distorted  
Not clear to you  
Sometimes the beauty of love  
Just comes ringin' through.  
  
New glass in the window  
New leaf on the tree  
New distance between us  
You and me.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still walk side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?

Mindless drifter on the road  
Carry such an easy load  
It's how you look,  
And how you feel  
You must have  
A heart of steel.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
I can see you on a hill  
Comatose but walking still  
Curves beneath  
Your flowing gown  
Only I could  
Bring you down.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
Dogs that lick  
And dogs that bite  
Hounds that howl  
Through the night  
Broken leashes  
Are all over the floor  
Keys left hanging  
In a swinging door.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
Keep fuckin' up!

Fill her up! [Repeats]  
  
Her engine's running and the fuel is clean  
She only uses it 'cause she's a machine  
She don't use much though, just to get around  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
The awesome power of electricity  
Stored for you in a giant battery  
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
Fill her up! [Repeats]  
  
The world is ready for a whole new game  
Some old-timers wanna stay the same  
They like to advertise how clean and green they are  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
But she don't listen to what they say  
She burned the mess they clean(?) instead  
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
Fill her up! [Repeats]  
  
She's not the car that she used to be  
Keep ready for you, and she's ready for me  
Into the future that's her destiny  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line) [Repeats]

Try to find  
The perfect time  
To say something to you  
Filled with meaning  
Filled with truth  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
I'd wake up someday  
And the pain will all be gone  
Help me now I'm sinking fast,  
I gotta get along  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway Of Love  
  
Background noise  
On a changing sky  
You'll be making love to me  
I still feel you  
In my heart's eye  
  
But I'm just a dusty soul  
With nothing much to say  
Down here in the hay,  
Bound to stay that way  
I've got almost everything  
Except that little key  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
Some will say  
There's a place on high  
Where angels rip their wings  
And babys learn to fly  
Some will say  
There's a place on high  
  
But I'd like to stay down here,  
Try to love someone  
Here in this life  
Where we watch the bouncing sun  
I'd just like to hold her hair  
And bring her back to me  
At the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
I'd make up some game  
And the pain would all be gone  
Help me now I'm sinking fast,  
I gotta get along  
To the gateway of love  
Gateway of Love

God save our gracious Queen,  
Long live our noble Queen,  
God save the Queen  
  
Send her victorious,  
Happy and glorious,  
Long to reign over us  
God save the Queen.  
  
(Long may she reign)  
  
O Lord, our God, arise,  
Scatter the evil lies  
And make them fall.  
  
Confound their politics,  
Frustrate their empty tricks,  
On thee our hopes we fix  
God save the Queen.  
  
(Long may she reign)  
(God save the Queen)  
  
My country dissipates  
Sweet land of liberty  
On thee I see  
  
Land where my fathers died  
Land of the ? cry  
From every mountainside  
Let freedom reign  
  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign

There's plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do what  
They're able to do  
We got so much to be happy about.  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
She's strong and she's soft  
And she's honest to me  
She really helps me  
To be a good man.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand  
What life without them would be.  
  
There's plenty of wheat  
On the prairies  
Lots of coal in the mines  
We got soldiers so strong  
They can bury their dead  
And still not go back  
Shooting blind.  
  
There's women and men  
On the workforce  
Doing forty hours  
Plus overtime  
So the hostages  
Held at the airport  
Can come home  
To something worthwhile.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand  
What life without them would be.  
  
And there's plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do  
What they're able to do  
We got so much to be happy about.  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
She's strong and she's soft  
And she's honest to me  
It really helps me  
To be a good man.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand.  
No, nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan.

In a foreign land  
There were creatures at play  
Running hand in hand  
Leading nowhere to stay  
Driven to the mountains high  
They were sunken in the cities deep  
Livin' in my sleep.  
  
I feel like goin' back  
Back where there's nowhere to stay  
When fire fills the sky  
I'll still remember that day  
These rocks I'm climbin' down  
Have already left the ground  
Careening through space.  
  
I used to build these buildings  
I used to walk next to you  
Their shadows tore us apart  
And now we do what we do  
Driven to the mountains high  
Sunken in the cities deep  
Livin' in our sleep.  
  
I feel like goin' back  
Back where there's nowhere to stay.

Now that the holidays have come  
They can relax and watch the sun  
Rise above all of the beautiful things  
They've done.  
  
Go to the country take the dog  
Look at the sky without the smog  
See the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs  
Eat hot dogs.  
  
What a pity  
That the people from the city  
Can't relate to the slower things  
That the country brings.  
  
Time itself is bought and sold.  
The spreading fear of growing old  
Contains a thousand foolish games  
That we play.  
  
While people planning trips to stars  
Allow another boulevard to claim  
A quiet country lane  
It's insane.  
  
So the subtle face is a loser  
This time around.  
Here we are in the years  
Where the showman shifts the gears  
Lives become careers  
Children cry in fear  
Let us out of here!

Well, I've seen some women  
They put your soul on ice  
They want a piece of the action  
But they never let you roll the dice.  
  
That's the kind of woman  
Bring a good man down  
That's the kind of woman  
I don't want around  
Hey hey.  
  
I got a woman that dances  
She knows how to jump and shout  
Now she don't want to use me  
'Cause she knows how it wears me out.  
  
Yeah, she's the woman  
With the magic touch  
She don't want to lose me  
'Cause she loves me too much  
Hey hey.  
  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me.  
Yeah, she knows how to please me  
She knows how to set me free.  
  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off that M.T.V.  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off your M.T.V.  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me.

Take my advice  
Don't listen to me  
It ain't paradise  
But it used to be  
There was a time  
When the river was wide  
And the water came running down  
To the rising tide  
But the wooden ships  
Were just a hippie dream  
Just a hippie dream.  
  
Don't bat an eye  
Don't waste a word  
Don't mention nothin'  
That could go unheard  
'Cause the tie-dye sails  
Are the screamin' sheets  
And the dusty trail  
Leads to blood in the streets  
And the wooden ships  
Are a hippie dream  
Capsized in excess  
If you know what I mean.  
  
Just because it's over for you  
Don't mean it's over for me  
It's a victory for the heart  
Every time the music starts  
So please don't kill the machine  
Don't kill the machine  
Don't kill the machine.  
  
Another flower child goes to seed  
In an ether-filled room of meat-hooks  
It's so ugly  
So ugly.

When I was a hitchhiker on the road  
I had to count on you  
But you needed me to ease the load  
And for conversation too  
Or judge you, just pass on through.  
  
You didn't see me in Toronto  
When I first tried out some hash  
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again  
But I didn't have the cash  
I didn't have the cash  
  
Then I tried amphetamines  
And my head was in a glass  
Taped underneath the speedometer wires  
Of my '48 Buick's dash.  
But I knew that wouldn't last.  
  
Then came California  
When I first saw open water  
In the land of opportunity  
I knew I was getting hotter  
I knew I was getting hotter.  
  
But the neon lights  
And the endless nights  
Fame took me by surprise  
The doctor gave me Valium  
But I still couldn't close my eyes  
I still couldn't close my eyes.  
  
Then came paranoia  
And it ran away with me  
I would not sign my autograph  
Or appear on TV  
Or see or be seen  
  
Living in the country  
Looked good to me  
Smoking grass while the summer passed  
In the real organic sea  
Where everything was green  
  
Then we had a kid and we split apart  
I was living on the road  
And a little cocaine went a long, long way  
To ease that different load  
And my head did explode  
My head did explode.  
  
I thought I was an Aztec  
Or a runner in Peru  
I could build such beautiful buildings  
To house the chosen few  
Like an Inca from Peru.  
  
How many years have come and gone  
Like friends and enemies  
I tried leave my past behind  
But it's catching up with me  
It's catching up with me  
  
I don't know how I'm standin' here  
Livin' in my life  
I'm thankful for my children  
And my faithful wife

Hello, my old friend.  
It's good to see you smiling.  
You've been around so long, you must be strong.  
And single life really has its fine points,  
Like friends to help you out when things go wrong.  
  
Hold back the tears  
That you've been cryin'.  
Push off the fears  
When they come around.  
  
Hold back the tears,  
And keep on trying.  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love.  
  
Two lying fools,  
And then four cryin' eyes,  
Counting on one another to survive.  
Crazy love must surely have this pain,  
If getting up means going down again.  
  
Hold back the tears  
That you've been cryin'.  
Push off the fears  
When they come around.  
  
Hold back the tears,  
And keep on trying.  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love.

Hold on to your love  
Hold on to your love  
Though you may feel tired and blue.  
The things you say,  
The things you dream you might do,  
Come true if you  
Hold on to your love.  
  
How long the day?  
How dark the night spent apart?  
Is this the way to learn?  
Go your own way  
Although you may break a heart  
Don't let it start  
Hold on to your love.  
  
Hold on to your love.  
Hold on to your love.  
  
The things you say,  
The things you dream you might do,  
If only you hold on to your love.  
Hold on to your love.

When I hold you in my arms  
It's a breath of fresh air,  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there,  
All those people with their faces  
Walkin' up the street,  
They don't have to say a thing  
Just look around and you see.  
  
New buildings going up,  
Old buildings coming down,  
New signs going up,  
Old signs coming down,  
You gotta hold onto something in this life.  
  
Well the older generation  
They got something to say,  
But they better say it fast  
Or get outta the way.  
All those gangsters with their crimes  
They make it look so good,  
We've been blowing up the planet  
Just like the old neighbourhood.  
  
New buildings going up,  
Old buildings coming down,  
New signs going up,  
Old signs coming down,  
You gotta hold onto something in this life.  
  
If I only had a heart  
It would beat all night for you,  
If I only had a heart  
I would cry the whole day through,  
When I hold you in my arms  
It's like a breath of fresh air,  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there.  
  
Old heart's going up,  
Old heart's coming down,  
My feelings going up,  
My feelings coming down,  
You gotta hold onto someone in this life.  
  
When I hold you in my arms  
It's a breath of fresh air.  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there.

I'm not the same man  
I was a while ago  
I've learned some new things,  
I hope that it shows.  
  
I'm free to give my love,  
But you're not the one  
I'm thinking of,  
So for me  
The wheels are turning  
Got to keep  
The homefires burning.  
  
I'll walk these borders  
In search of a line,  
Between young lovers  
Who live separate lives.  
  
How long can this go on?  
I can hear another song,  
Late at night  
When I've been drinking  
Substitute comes at me winking.

Homegrown's all right with me.  
Homegrown is the way it should be.  
Homegrown is a good thing.  
Plant that bell and let it ring.  
  
The sun comes up in the morning,  
Shines that light around.  
One day, without no warning,  
Things start jumping up from the ground.  
  
Well, homegrown's all right with me.  
Homegrown is the way it should be.  
Homegrown is a good thing.  
Plant that bell and let it ring.

In the land of the broken hearted  
People lookin' for the horseshoe man  
They've been picking up little pieces  
They've been puttin' 'em all in his hand  
  
And the way the story started  
Two lovers long ago  
Took a vow to live with heart break  
Took a chance but how could they know love?  
  
How could they know love?  
Love, how could they know love  
  
Horseshoe man's been working his magic  
Fixin' heart break everywhere  
He's the one we all can count on  
When we're lost and don't know where love is  
  
He takes the pieces in his hand  
And shakes 'em up like he doesn't care  
He says there will always be heart break  
Because love is everywhere  
  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know  
  
Love don't care if you're wrong or right  
Love don't know if you're black or white  
Love ain't lookin' for perfection  
Love's the answer  
Love's the question  
  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know about love

I come down from the misty mountain  
I got lost on the human highway  
Take my head refreshing fountain  
Take my eyes from what they've seen.  
Take my head and change my mind  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
I come down from the crooked mansion  
I went lookin' for the D.J.'s daughter  
Since that day I heard it mentioned  
That my name is on the line.  
Now, my name is on the line  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
Now, my name is on the line  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
I come down from the misty mountain  
I got lost on the human highway  
Take my head refreshing fountain  
Take my eyes from what they've seen.  
Take my head and change my mind  
How could people get so unkind.

I am a child, I last a while  
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile  
You hold my hand, buff up my hair  
It's lots of fun to have you there  
  
I gave to you, now you give to me  
I'd like to know what you've learned  
The sky is blue and so is the sea  
What is the color when black is burned?  
What is the color?  
  
You are a man, you understand  
You pick me up and you lay me down again  
You make the rules, you say what's fair  
It's lots of fun to have you there

Now that you found yourself losing your mind  
Are you here again?  
Finding that what you once thought was real  
Is gone, and changing?  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day?  
How can I place you above me?  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
I believe in you.  
  
Coming to you at night I see my questions  
I feel my doubts  
Wishing that maybe in a year or two  
We could laugh and let it all out  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day?  
How can I place you above me?  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
I believe in you.

For the love of man  
Who could understand  
What goes on  
What is right  
And what is wrong  
Why the angels cry  
And the heaven's sigh  
When a child is born to live  
But not like you and I.  
  
Let the angels ring the bells  
In the holy hall  
May they hear the voice  
That calls to them  
For the love of man  
Who will understand  
It's alright  
I know it's alright.  
  
Down the dusty road  
To the forest church  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why  
On the ocean wave  
In the billowing sky  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why.  
  
Let the angels ring the bells  
In the holy hall  
Let them hear  
The voice that calls.  
For the love of man  
Who will understand  
It's alright  
But I wonder why.  
  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.

Well, I'm goin', I'm goin'  
Goin' on a downhill slide.  
I'm goin', I'm goin'  
Goin' on a downhill slide.  
Things feel so easy  
I'm never gonna change my mind.  
  
I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'.  
  
Well, ride me babe  
Hang on to my hat  
Ride me babe  
Hang on to my hat  
I'll howl like a wolf  
Scream like an alley cat.  
  
I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'.  
  
Don't wanna change my mind.  
Don't wanna reel it in.  
Don't wanna stop  
This slidin' honey  
That's the shape I'm in.  
  
I'm goin', I'm goin'  
On a downhill slide.  
Things feels so easy  
I'm never gonna change my mind.  
  
I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'.  
  
Goin', goin',  
Goin', goin', goin'.  
  
I'm goin' on a downhill slide.  
  
Watch me now, watch me now.  
  
Goin', goin',  
Goin', goin', goin'.

I'm an accident  
I was driving way too fast  
Couldn't stop though  
So I let the moment last  
I'm for rollin'  
I'm for tossin' in my sleep  
It's not guilt though  
It's not the company I keep  
  
People my age  
They don't do the things I do  
They go somehwere  
While I run away with you  
I got my friends  
And I got my children too  
I got her love  
She's got my love too  
  
I can't hear you  
But I feel the things you say  
I can't see you  
But I see what's in my way  
Now I'm floatin'  
Cause I'm not tied to the ground  
Words I've spoken  
Seem to leave a hollow sound  
  
On the long plain  
See the rider in the night  
See the chieftain  
See the braves in cool moonlight  
Who will love them  
When they take another life  
Who will hold them  
When they tremble for the knife  
  
Voicemail numbers  
On an old computer screen  
Rows of lovers  
Parked forever in a dream  
Screaming sirens  
Echoing across the bay  
To the old boats  
From the city far away  
  
Homeless heroes  
Walk the streets of their hometown  
Rows of zeros  
On a field that's turning brown  
They play baseball  
They play football under lights  
They play card games  
And we watch them every night  
  
Need distraction  
Need romance and candlelight  
Need random violence  
Need entertainment tonight  
Need the evidence  
Want the testimony of  
Expert witnesses  
On the brutal crimes of love  
  
I was too tired  
To see the news when I got home  
Pulled the curtain  
Fell into bed alone  
Started dreaming  
Saw the rider once again  
In the doorway  
Where she stood and watched for him  
Watched for him  
  
I'm not present  
I'm a drug that makes you dream  
I'm an aerostar  
I'm a cutlass supreme  
In the wrong lane  
Trying to turn against the flow  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the giant undertow  
  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the giant undertow  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the giant undertow  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean

Baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I said, baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I'll send you flowers  
Every day girl,  
If you will promise to be mine,  
Forever more.  
And if you say  
The words I long to hear,  
You know how happy I'll be.  
  
So baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.

Children are laughing  
In the sun  
I count the voices  
One by one  
But I'm not there  
To share the fun  
I'm out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home.  
  
I'm happy singing  
In a crowd  
The lights are bright,  
The music's loud  
I like to look  
In every face  
But out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home.  
  
Out in the dusty  
Desert wind  
The fox goes looking  
For a friend  
She sees a light  
Around the bend  
I'm out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home.
