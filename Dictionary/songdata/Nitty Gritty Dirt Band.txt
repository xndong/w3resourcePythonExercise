I beg your pardon momma  
What did you say?  
My mind was drifted off on Martinique Bay  
It's not that I'm not interested you see  
Augusta Georgia is just no place to be  
  
I think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin' rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
We'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove  
  
Keep on talkin' momma I can't hear  
Your voice it tickles down inside of my ear  
I feel a tropical vacation this year  
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer  
  
I think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin' rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
We'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove  
  
Voila! An American Dream  
Well we can travel girl without any means  
When it's as easy as closin' your eyes  
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign  
  
Just keep talkin' momma I like that sound  
It goes so easy with that rain fallin' down  
I think a tropical vacation this year  
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer, and  
  
Voila! An American Dream  
Yeah we can travel girl without any means  
When it's as easy as closin' your eyes  
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign  
  
Just think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin' rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
Split the difference go to Coconut Grove

A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside it'll soon fall apart.  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love, so it goes.  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, you don't mean a thing  
He would walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
He knows what it means to be a wealthy man.  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Colossus will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love, so it goes.  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away  
There's just one thing's put here to stay  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love.

Some people say that the fate of a man  
Is written down in the palm of his hand  
Others say they can see it all in the cards and how they fall  
I don't need my fortune told  
As long as I've got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as you're loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I can't read 'em, but I love the light  
Heaven knows I'm right where I want to be  
As long as you're loving me  
  
I don't need a crystal ball  
Wouldn't even want to know at all  
I've got everything I need  
As long as you're loving me  
  
Who knows what tomorrow brings?  
One day changes everything  
I'm willing to wait and see  
As long as you're loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I can't read 'em, but I love the light  
Heaven knows I'm right where I want to be  
As long as you're loving me  
  
I don't need my fortune told  
As long as I've got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as you're loving me  
  
I've got everything I need as long as you're loving me  
As long as you're loving me  
Oh, as long as you're loving me

She looked so proud and held her head up high  
And her eyes were softer than a summer sky  
And in the distance there were clouds  
Somebody made her cry  
And the salt of the tears she couldn't hide  
Told her broken hearts need time to mend  
Mostly thinkin' that this girl might need a friend  
But suddenly her eyes met mine, world went in a spin  
And I knew I'd never be the same again  
  
Baby blues oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven and my refuge  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
  
Now I'm with those blue eyes everyday  
And even in the silence they have so much to say  
Talk to my heart, bring some sunshine and the rain  
Make me look at love a brand new way  
  
Baby blues oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven when I found you  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby blues  
  
Oh baby baby oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven when I found you  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby blues  
  
Baby blues  
Baby blues  
All caught up in those baby baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby baby blues  
Baby blues

In 1814 we took a little trip,  
Along with colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.  
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,  
And we fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',  
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.  
  
Oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come.  
There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on a drum.  
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.  
We stood behind our cotton bales and didn?t say a thing.  
  
Old hickory said we could take 'em by surprise,  
If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eyes.  
We held our fire till we seen their faces well,  
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em a little, well, we  
  
Fired our guns and the British kept a comin',  
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.  
  
We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down,  
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round.  
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind,  
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',  
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',  
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.

Here on the hilltop where we fell in love  
Many moons later, now we're giving up  
I start the engine, you start to cry  
It's a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye.  
  
How many times have we wished on a star,  
Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car  
We saw Halley's comet in lunar eclipse  
And I sure saw heaven when I tasted your lips.  
  
So blow out the stars, turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end  
  
When our love was new as the first evening star  
We both said I'll worship you just as you are  
Then I tried to change you, girl, and I don't know why  
You tried to change me, hey we might as well try.  
  
To blow out the stars, turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end.  
  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end

There she sits buddy just gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt  
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts  
Drives just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
So when I die buddy throw my body in the back  
And take me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in a Mercury '49  
Junior Johnson running in the woods of Caroline  
Even Burt Reynolds in a Black Trans Am  
Are gonna meet me down at the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Driving all alone in a Colorado night  
You're my last love, baby you're my last chance  
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur

Hey baby, it's beginning to feel  
Like we've been spinning our wheels  
Hangin' round this town too long  
Why don't we catch a ride  
Sail away on the outbound tide  
It's time that we be movin' on  
Let's catch the next dream outta here  
Close our eyes and disappear  
We'll say so long and we'll be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
Were as free as the night is young  
To go as far as our hearts can run  
Let's set our sights on paradise  
Throw caution to the wind  
And never look back again  
We'll ride our love on through the night  
Chorus  
We'll say so long  
And we'll be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
Just close your eyes  
And we can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo  
On the next dream  
On the next dream outta here  
We can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo

Darling what are we goin' through  
It's no secret what I do  
Always through revolving doors  
Each time's harder than before  
What goes around comes around  
I'll be with you when I can  
I know it's hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Seems I'm gone before I left  
Always just one step ahead  
For you it's longer, marking time  
Lovin' me as I pass by  
Chorus  
When daddy's on the doorstep  
He won't take you for granted  
It's better than the very first time  
You can count on me, eventually  
Can't make up for the time we've lost  
Stolen from myself the most  
I keep your picture close to me  
Take it out for the boys to see  
What goes around comes around  
I'll be home when I can  
Sometimes it's hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Woohoo mmmhmmm  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
Around and round and round

Looking out the window of this hollywood hotel,  
You'd never know that it was christmas eve.  
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,  
And the temperature is 84 degrees.  
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below  
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene  
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,  
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.  
  
But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air  
From telluride to boulder down below  
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere  
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow  
  
I remember christmases when I was just a boy  
In the morning I would run to see the tree.  
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy  
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.  
Now the sun is setting in the california sky  
And I can't find the spirit anywhere  
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye  
I'm going back home toook for christmas there  
  
But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air  
From telluride to boulder down below  
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere  
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

You wanted to be street wise  
Went and got involved  
Now you're trapped and helpless  
Problems you can't solve  
One side and the other  
There's no shelter  
In a crossfire  
Had to play with big boys  
Grew up much too fast  
They ran and left you  
Facing things you can't resist  
Better keep your head down  
Finally had your showdown  
Crossfire  
You and I  
Friends long gone  
Lies on lies  
On and on and on  
You and I  
Bridges burn  
Lies on lies  
Who's gonna rescue you  
Tell me who's gonna  
Who's gonna wear the bleeding heart  
Put it on the line  
When you gonna pay attention  
Sentence fits the crime  
Can't hold out much longer  
Shots are coming closer  
Crossfire  
And it's one side and the other  
There's no shelter  
In a crossfire  
Oh it's one side and the other  
There's no shelter  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire

I played a wedding for the money,  
And I wished that I could tell the bride and groom  
Just what I thought of marriage  
And what's in store after their honeymoon.  
  
And I was grumblin' to the dancers  
'Bout how men and women ought to live apart  
And how a promise never made can not be broken  
And can never break your heart  
  
When suddenly from out of nowhere,  
A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,  
And all her crinolines were billowing  
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.  
Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests  
As each of them was drawn inside her dream,  
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet  
And hollered at her "dance little jean"  
  
Dance, little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people you love, stood up and said "I do"  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had  
Was answered today  
Your mama's marrying your dad  
  
Well, my cynical heart just melted  
'Cause I knew what this get together meant  
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion  
That the little girl had spent.  
Well they told the band to pack it up  
About the time the couple cut the cake,  
But we played as long as they stayed  
For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.  
  
Dance, little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people you love, stood up and said "I do"  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had  
Was answered today  
Your mama's marrying your dad

Baby it's no mystery  
You don't have to tell me  
What you're doing here  
With all the stars in your blue eyes  
Washed away by disappointed tears  
  
You say another love has left you  
Feeling sad and insecure  
You'd like to think that it's all worth it  
But now you're not so sure  
Baby just because it's painful  
It doesn't mean it's real  
Sometimes we're simply desperate  
For something to feel, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
  
It's the same old bedtime story  
The same old dreams of glory  
We all hold on to  
It's all so beautifully tragic  
So painfully romantic  
But so far from the truth  
  
Baby I could slay your dragons  
But I'd rather set them free  
All I'm really asking is a chance to make you see  
There doesn't have to be a struggle  
There doesn't have to be a fight  
Before you taste the victory  
Before you feel it's right, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
  
Oh we all look for love in our lives  
But sometimes all you've gotta do is just open up your eyes  
But does there have to be a reason  
Or does there have to be a storm  
Before we we look for shelter in each others arms  
Baby leave behind this madness  
I'll give you tenderness  
I don't wanna see you have to settle for less, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
Don't underestimate love

Don't You Hear Jerusalem Moan  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't never let a chicken get big enough to crow  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Thank God there's a heaven and a ringing in my soul and my soul's got free  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Well a hard-shell preacher you can tell him how he do  
Well he chews his own tobacco and he drinks his own brew.  
Well a Baptist preacher you can tell him by his coat  
Has a bottle in his pocket that he can't hardly tote  
Well a Cambellite preacher his soul is saved  
Well he has to be baptized every other day  
Well the Holy Roller preacher he sure is a sight  
Well he gets em all a-rolling and he kicks out the light  
Well the Presbyterian preacher he lives in town  
His neck's so stiff he can't hardly look around.  
  

Seems like lately we're losin' touch  
Work to hard and worry too much  
I think it's time for me and you  
To get back to what we used to do  
  
We'd steal away on a Saturday night  
Meet in the field when the time was right  
Just us two and a starry sky  
Felt like paradise  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
Like it did back then, it'll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
  
Remember all the songs that we used to know  
Dancin' in the dark to the radio  
Lost in the rythmn, kickin' up some heat  
The memories are still so sweet  
  
Time's gone by but it's plain to see  
I still love you and you still love me  
Let's shake these troubles put 'em all aside  
see'mon we're gonna take that ride  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
  
Like it did back then, it'll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
Down that road

All alone in a sleepless night  
Passing time with a runaway moon  
Talkin' to myself  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
It's been too long since I held you girl  
Twice a thousand miles  
But my heart won't beat alone  
I need the love I left behind  
  
Hold back the dawn awhile  
This will all work out  
Don't let this dream die  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
And I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again  
  
Now the night is dark with diamonds  
And I'm standing inside the rain  
Giving up your love  
Was the worst mistake I made  
There's a sound I hear in the distance  
Seems it's calling out my name  
Well I'll pay most any price  
I just hope I'm not too late  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Oh, it's true  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
I see a fire in the sky  
Just like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love

Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust  
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost  
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed  
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read  
  
[Chorus:]  
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room  
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon

Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite,  
Shinin' thru the trees,  
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs  
Are floatin on the breeze  
Baby get ready.....  
  
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump road  
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows  
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo  
  
You and me going fishing in the dark,  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows.  
Down by the river in the full moon light,  
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night  
Just movin' slow...  
  
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's come  
And the days are gettin' long  
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along  
Baby get ready.....  
  
And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite  
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night  
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo.  
  
Repeat the chorus (x3)  
  
You and me going fishin in the dark!

(Here we go)  
  
Same these days, I think about her  
Dream up ways to live with out her  
We made vows that I can not excuse  
Yes forever don't last the way it used too  
  
We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with  
The law says you might confess to  
Enough coals, hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose  
That forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Hammers, razors fill the trash  
You throw'em out when you use the last  
Get a new form son, don't become confused  
If forever don't last the way it used to  
  
Forever don't last, forever don't last  
Forever don't last, forever don't last the way it used too  
Forever don't last, forever don't last  
Forever don't last, forever don't last  
  
(Take a break)

Oh, hello, this is your heart speaking

Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
And get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Moonlit shadow, she starts a trippin' firelight  
Jumpin' the trees lyin' across the right of way  
Silvery mornin' it glistens down the valley  
But she don't stop 'til we ride the night away  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Blonde braids tangle at the misty break of mornin'  
Catchin' light through a dusty window pane  
Lost in lust, in denial of the warnin'  
She digs her heels in this stallion's flank again  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You paid the price, you get to play  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You're gonna ride to the break of day  
  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You paid the price, you get to play  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You're gonna ride to the break of day

When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go  
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
When you and your baby have a fallin' out  
Just call me up sweet mama and we'll go steppin' out  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
We're goin' to the city to the city fair  
If you go to the city then you will find me there  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.  
  
When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go  
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'  
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby  
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.

I can see your heart is aching  
She hurt you more than she knew  
Should you ever want to love again  
I'll be faithful to you  
  
You've been crying like the willow  
When the night bird sings so blue  
Trust was broken but hearts will give  
And I'll be faithful to you  
  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Where a promise don't hold true  
Here's a vow you can be sure of  
I'll be faithful to you  
  
So let me dry away your lonesome tears  
Like the sun melts morning dew  
And I will wrap you up in true, true love  
I'll be faithful to you  
  
And I will wrap you up in true, true love  
I'll be faithful to you

Never had trouble sleepin'  
Always had someone next to me  
Nights I won't remember  
I fooled around til the fool was me  
  
Never thought much about you  
On and off like a well worn shoe  
Now I worry where you're walkin'  
I guess the shoe's on another foot  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt, I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy, it must be love  
  
Lately I'm hearin' rumors  
You've been makin' serious plans  
Should I have held you when I had you  
Right here in the palm of my hand  
  
Chorus  
  
This much heartache, it must be love  
  
Ohoh a little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt, I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy  
A little more pain and I'll know it  
A little more hurt and I'll know it's love  
Over and over til it's over  
Drives me crazy, drives me crazy  
  
This much heartache, it must be love  
  
Must be love, it must be love  
Oh it must be love, must be love  
It must be love, must be love  
It must be love, oh it must be love  
Must be love, oh it must be love

My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
It's a long way from here to over yonder  
My feet, they're getting mighty sore  
I ain't comin' back, you've made your mind to wander  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
I'll be a long time gone from you, baby  
You'll never hear me knock upon your door  
Thought you were worth it once but I was crazy  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be  
You're gonna give your love to me  
I'm gonna love you night and day  
Well love is love and not fade away  
Well love is love and not fade away  
  
My love bigger than a Cadillac  
I try to show it and you're drivin' me back  
Your love for me has got to be real  
For you to know just how I feel  
Love is real and not fade away  
Well love is real and not fade away  
  
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be  
You're gonna give your love to me  
Love to last more than one day  
Well love is love and not fade away  
Well love is love and not fade away  
Well love is love and not fade away  
Love, love is love and not fade away  
Not fade away  
Not fade away

Oh what a love, that'll bind the wounds of a loss and heal my heart  
Oh what a love, to cast away the pain  
Oh what a love, that'll bear for me the cost of a brand new start  
Oh what a love, to let me begin again  
Oh what a life, that'll brighten up the corners of a lonely life  
Oh what a life, to cast away the rain  
Oh what a life to remove the gloom I face in the dark alone  
Oh what a life, I believe I can see again  
I remember the day  
We walked on the beach till sunset, then we sang  
And the songs we played were a promise of love that'll last beyond the grave  
Oh what a song, learned from the sea taught slowly to the young  
Oh what a song, to cast away the rain  
Oh what a song, to break the bonds of fear and still the sound  
Oh what a song, I believe I can sing again  
I remember the day we met at a place of hope, I took what you gave  
And the words we'd say were a promise of love that'll honor beyond the grave  
Chorus  

If this is our last dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
I don't want to be the one  
To say the night is over  
I don't want to be the one  
To say goodbye  
Let's face the music  
There's no turning back  
Just take my hand  
  
If this is our la-a-a-ast dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
Baby let me waltz away  
The memories of hard times  
Let me wipe away  
The tears from your eyes  
Can we be tender  
Just one more time  
We have tonight  
  
If this is our la-a-a-ast dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let me walk you home to your door  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let's have one more night together  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let me waltz you around across the floor  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)

When I look into your eyes  
See the world cut down to size  
Baby don't apologize  
Takin' me one step over the line  
  
When I touch your secret skin  
Babe I know it ain't no sin  
I feel you startin' to give in  
Now let's go one step over the line  
  
I know it's just your daddy's car  
Your daddy never went this far  
Baby we know who we are  
Let's go one step over the line  
  
I can be your drivin' wheel  
We could make those tires squeal  
Ooo I like the way it feels  
Takin' it one step over the line  
  
One step forward and two steps back  
It's for the first time baby  
I'm talkin' cake walkin' into the black  
A crossin' red line and I don't mean maybe  
  
I hear they buried lover's lane  
In a sea of tears and blame  
It's you and me go up in flames  
Baby, one step over the line  
  
They're drawin' boxes on the ground  
Just to make us look on down  
All we gotta do is look around  
And take it one step over the line  
  
A one step over the line  
Come on baby, one step over the line

I made a living writing lover's dream words,  
I found the notes to hang them on  
I fround a way to play with the meaning of things  
And I came up with a couple good songs.  
And so I oughta have an easy answer,  
I oughta have some pretty things to say,  
But I haven't found the combination  
That'll make you change your mind and wanna stay.  
So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket  
And I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours  
Listen to the laughter of the children  
She scratched on the back of a bill  
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse  
On the burnt crust browning pan hill  
To where they don't take sad for an answer,  
A place at the corner of your heart,  
Where music meets with memories,  
So you can recognize the feeling from the start  
How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?  
I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours  
They'll put us on the radio so you'll know that I am yours  

I've known for a long time  
The kind of girl you are  
And a smile that covers teardrops  
The way your head yields to your heart  
Of things you've kept inside  
That most girls couldn't bear  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
Yes, I've known of all the heartaches  
And I've known of all the pain  
I've seen you when the the sun shines  
And I've seen you when it rains  
I've seen you make a look of love  
From just an icy stare  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
I know I've been blind  
To not have loved you all this time  
To not have loved you all this time  
But the image of you wasn't clear  
I guess I've been standing too near  
It's taken me a while  
But I have finally found  
What you are to me  
And that's what really counts  
And what you are to me  
Is something we can share  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
Yes, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care

Well the little things that you say and do  
Make me want to be with you  
Oh, rave on it's a crazy feeling  
And I know it's got me reelin'  
  
When you say I love you  
Rave on  
The way you dance and hold me tight  
The way you kiss when we goodnight  
  
Rave on its a crazy feeling  
And I know its got me reelin'  
When you say I love you  
Oh, Rave on  
  
Well rave on its a crazy feeling  
And I know its got me reelin'  
I'm so glad your revealing your love for me  
Rave on, Rave on, tell me,  
  
Tell me not to be lonely,  
Tell me, you love me only  
Rave on to me

Headed south on 65, route 5 or 6 I'll drive  
There's a place where the folks from dixie go  
You don't need no cowboy boots, trade'em in for a bathing suit  
Hang out on the Gulf Of Mexico  
  
On a weekend holiday  
We don't parlez vous francais  
Turnin' it up from a sunny day  
Then we dance the night away  
On the redneck riviera  
On the red-ed neck riviera  
On the redneck riviera  
It's a paradise, oh yeah  
(Oh) yeah  
  
Sippin' hospitality under proud umbrella trees  
Good ol' boys and the long necks scattered 'round  
Girls come rushin' from a far when I strum "Louie Louie" on my old guitar  
String bikini, happy hunting ground  
  
Chorus  
  
We don't have to parlez vous francais  
Well the surf is up in Alabam'  
Mississippi, Florida and the Gulf shore sand  
Stoke your fire with a sunny day, yeah  
Just like them folks in St. Tropez  
  
On the redneck riviera  
On the red-ed neck riviera  
On the redneck riviera  
It's a paradise, oh yeah  
It's a paradise, oh yeah  
It's a paradise, Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh, the surf is up in Florida down  
Panama City to the Destin Sound  
You can stoke your fire with a sunny day, yeah  
Just like them folks in St. Topez  
  
Hey this is the south  
Not the south of France

I've got ripplin' water to wake me  
To the mornin', my woman, and love.  
Tall pine trees are pointin' us easily to heaven above.  
Blue spruce clinin' to the grade in the evening  
They take the chill away fine.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
There's a worn red chair by the window  
That we found at a sale down the way  
When some old women said that they  
Needed more room for the winter.  
People like pullin' at the stuffin' when they sit down.  
It helps passin' the time.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
And oh, like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away.  
And you make me feel fine.  
And you make my world a warmer place  
By the sparklin' of your diamond face.  
On a frayed spot put a little lace.  
And you make me feel fine.  
Warm as the mountain sunshine  
On the edge of the snow line  
In a meadow of columbine.  
  
Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for  
What you got on your mind.  
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.  
Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is  
Slightly less than divine.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
Ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes  
In the walls that are keepin' me warm.  
The closest I've been to my family for days is my music.  
Silently starin' at the mornin' sky  
It's just like hearin' her callin' my name.  
Cut the telephone line and the story might change.  
  
And oh, like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away.  
And you make me feel fine.  
And you make my world

She  
She came from the land of the cotton  
A land that was nearly forgotten  
By everyone  
  
And she  
She worked and she slaved so hard  
Big old field was her backyard  
In the Delta sun  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Oh my, she sure could sing  
  
And he  
Looked down and he took a little pity  
Whole town swore, he decided  
He would help us out  
  
And he  
Didn't mind that she wasn't very pretty  
'Cause deep inside his heart he knew  
She was the only one  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Hey, she sure could sing  
  
She had faith, she had believing  
She led all the people together in singing  
And she prayed every night to the Lord up above  
Singing, "Hallelujah"  
  
They  
Used to walk, singing songs by the river  
Even when she knew for sure  
She'd have to go away  
  
She  
Never knew what a life was to give her  
Never had to worry about it  
For one single day  
  
Oh my, she sure could sing  
Oh yeah, she sure could sing  
  
She was singing, singing, "Hallelujah"  
  
And she  
She came from the land of the cotton  
A land that was nearly forgotten  
By everyone  
  
And she  
She worked and she slaved so hard  
The big old field was her backyard  
In the Delta sun  
  
Oh, oh, she sure could sing  
Yeah, she sure could sing  
Oh yeah, she sure could sing  
Yeah, she sure could sing

Once I had a heart cold as ice  
And love to me was only for fun  
And I made a mark for each broken heart  
Like nuches on the but of a gun  
  
Once I had a track on my sleeve  
And a reputation all over town  
I was heartless and cold and wherever I go  
I shut down every young girl I found  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
Who thought that someone like you  
Would take a desperado like me  
But all here I am, I'm week as a lamb  
With my bleading heart there at your feet  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
Shut full of love

You've got to be the rich man  
You keep your momma worrying  
They say that life's a bitch man  
So you run and you run and you run  
Got to be the fat man  
To keep the pretty woman happy  
Cause if she get's the itch man  
She'll run and she'll run and she'll run  
You never hear the shot  
That brings you down  
One day you wake up  
A hole in your life  
Don't know you've fallen  
Until you hit the ground  
Too many pieces to pick up  
And put back  
Got to be chic man  
Drive a Masarati  
Don't want to be no geek man  
So you run and you run and you run  
Your down friends are comin' around  
One day you wake up  
Flat on your face  
The only difference is  
You're all alone  
Too many pieces to pick up  
And put back  
Run and run  
Run and run  
You've got to be the rich man  
You keep the finest all to yourself  
They say that life's a bitch man  
Cause you run and you run and you run  
Yes you run  
And you run

You run

Yes you run

Run and run

I am loyal on those who care  
Who care about the fate of love  
I know there's many others just like me  
I know they too had enough  
Of these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Wooh ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
I've seen it in your eyes, you felt the heat  
There was a time when you believed  
Love is the only way to make it through  
Hardly another casualty  
From these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
Look at all these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Wooh ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love

Dark cloud is coming  
Headed straight for your heart  
Might get just a little bit crazy, baby  
Might try to tear us apart  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
Everybody wants love to be easy  
But it's never been that way  
Each love starts out with blue skies  
Sometimes those blue skies turn grey  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the strong love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightning strikes  
Hold on, darling  
It's gonna be alright  
  
'Cause when the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain

I remember our first night together  
It was rainin' cats and dogs, when we made love  
Made the most of all that stormy weather  
That's what this ol' night reminds me of  
  
Thunder and lightning  
Nothing like a storm  
Cozy up beside me honey  
And let me keep you warm  
Nothing more invitin'  
Then a good one comin' down  
Born two rainy day lovers  
Who love to hear the sound  
Of thunder and lightning

Always brings a sparkle to your eye  
It's music to my ears each time the wind blows  
We know how to spend a stormy night

She's a young one  
Hard to find  
Can't be shaken  
Or handed a line  
Her eyes are loaded  
Point at you  
With a look  
That's too good to be true  
  
She takes your daydreams  
No concern  
All your night times  
You toss and you turn  
So independent  
Never alone  
She's a jewel  
That's much too hot to be worn  
  
She's a lovely, lovely girl  
High, lookin' down  
Upon her world  
Well I'll take a chance  
And play the fool  
But I know  
She's just too good to be true  
  
She's a young one  
Vanity's child  
Cosmopolitan  
Queen of the night  
So I'll catch her in the morning  
Sweet rendezvous  
But I know  
That girl's too good to be true  
  
She's a lovely, lovely girl  
High, in her lovely, lovely world  
Wooh, I'll take the chance  
And play the fool  
I know that girl's too beautiful  
She's too good to be true  
Much too good to be true  
She's too good to be true  
Woohoh, too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Girl's too good to be true

Feelin' kinda sad and lonely  
I lost my sweet one and only  
Gonna find my baby I don't mean no maybe  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna her home to me  
She said that she would never leave me  
Now she's gone away and it grieves me  
I was fast a-sleepin' when she come a-midnight creepin'  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
My bags are packed for to travel  
Gonna cover many miles of gravel  
Gonna find my baby 'cause she's the finest lady  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Going down Texas going to Georgia  
Oklahoma, Mississippi border  
Going to Alabammy going to Louisiana, Tennessee  
I'm a-gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring home with me  
(she heard the sky was fallin')  
I'm a-gonna find my baby gonna bring her with me

If my feet don't fail and my heart gets well,  
I'll be out of here by noon.  
Packin' my load on the road,  
You can color me gone.  
  
Settlin' in for a long hard ride,  
Miss you sittin' on the shotgun side.  
Difficult journey when your navigator is gone.  
  
It's Trying times when the I'll winds blow.  
Trying times when the rivers won't flow.  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show.  
Trying times when the going gets tough.  
Trying times when you pack it all up.  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love.  
Lose somebody you love.  
  
The sun's coming up on the Interstate, now,  
In the eastboud lane, I'm facin' the crowd.  
Wishing I could jump up out of this traffic and fly.  
Got a pain in my heart and I'm flat on my back,  
Like a blind horse walkin' down a railroad track  
I didn't know nothing till the train came whistlin' by.  
  
It's Trying times when the I'll winds blow.  
Trying times when the rivers won't flow.  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show.  
Trying times when the going gets tough.  
Trying times when you pack it all up.  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love.  
Lose somebody you love. Repeat 3x

Oh the the night is so still, not a baby will cry  
Not a chill wind will blow, disturbing the sky  
But there's no peace in me, I'm burning for you  
I'm walking the floor in the devil's shoes.  
  
When I get my rewards, I will bring them to you  
I shall ask for your love, and swear mine is true  
Will you cast me aside, and see me no more?  
How can I win your heart when I get my rewards?  
  
They say that your hair can never touch mine  
That a poor boy can't hope for a woman so fine  
But I work till I fall, determined to win  
Driven by need to see you again

I want to stand upon a rock, and watch the river flow  
With the blue sky above me and the valley down below.  
I want to hold my head up high, and listen to the wind  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again  
  
I want to sing the kind of songs that my dad sang to me,  
And try to be the man he hoped that I would be  
He said you only get one chance, you'd better do the best you can,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat, and hold your hand in mine,  
And hear you say you'll love me until the end of time.  
I want to find forever in every moment that we spend,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat  
And hold your hand in mine  
And hear you say you'll love me  
Until the end of time  
  
I want to stand upon a rock, like I did when I was young,  
And hold you close beside me, and watch our children run  
Cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind,  
And when it's gone, it won't be back again  
We only get one chance, so listen to the wind,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.

I was standing by my window  
On one cold and cloudy day  
When I saw that hearse come rolling  
For to carry my mother away  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
I said to that undertaker  
Undertaker please drive slow  
For this lady you are carrying  
Lord, I hate to see her go  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
Oh, I followed close behind her  
Tried to hold up and be brave  
But I could not hide my sorrow  
When they laid her in the grave  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
I went back home, my home was lonesome  
Missed my mother, she was gone  
All of my brothers, sisters crying  
What a home so sad and lone  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
We sang the songs of childhood  
Hymns of faith that made us strong  
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us  
Hear the angels sing along  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
There's a better home a-waiting  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain  
If you're looking for a wife  
'Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter  
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife.  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there.  
  
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain  
I want his daughter for my wife  
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain  
Though Clifton Clowers, he may take my life.  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there.  
  
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain  
It's too lonesome down here below  
It's just not right to hide his daughter  
From the one who loves her so  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there  
  
But I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain  
I'm gonna take the girl I love  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
  
I'm a gonna climb up on that mountain  
And I'll get the one I Iove  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers,  
I'm gonna find the one I love,  
  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
I'm gonna find the one I love

Who did you say it was brother?  
Who was it who fell by the way?  
When whiskey and blood run together  
Did you hear anyone pray?  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
When I heard the crash on the highway  
I knew what it was from the start  
I went to the scene of destruction  
And a picture was stamped on my heart  
  
There was whiskey and blood all together  
Mixed with glass where they lay  
Death played her hand in destruction  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I wish I could change this sad story  
That I am now telling you  
But there is no way I can change it  
For somebody's life is now through  
  
Their soul has been called by the Master  
They died in a crash on the way  
And I heard the groans of the dying  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray

Clouds so swift, the rain won't lift  
Gates won't close, the railings froze  
So get your mind off wintertime  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Buy me a flute, and a gun that shoots  
Tail gates and substitutes  
Strap yourself to a tree with roots  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Well I don't care how many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
So pack up your money, and pick up your tent  
You ain't going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
And genghis khan he could not keep  
All his men supplied with sleep  
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep  
When we get up to it  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my bride's gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  

Here we go sailin' low  
Bet your mom and pop, baby, will never know  
We're steppin' by the river  
Where the woodchucks go  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
When the sun come up, we go down  
You can have your partner  
And you're foolin' around  
Spendin' my time on the open ground  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
You can bring a bottle  
And we'll drink it on the track  
Baby never comin' back  
Well I can just imagine  
About a hundred years ago  
Old Number 7  
Just a steamin' on to heaven  
With it's twenty cars a rockin' in tow  
Bringin' on the payroll  
  
Here comes the sun now, we're havin' fun  
You and me together baby, are number one  
I can feel another day's just begun  
Thanks to the Yukon Railroad  
  
You can bring a bottle  
And we'll drink it on the track  
Baby never comin' back  
Well I can just imagine  
About a hundred years ago  
Old Number 7  
Just a steamin' on to heaven  
With it's twenty cars a rockin' in tow  
Bringin' on the payroll  
  
Yeah  
  
Well here we go, sailin' low  
Bet your mom and pop, baby, will never know  
Steppin' by the river  
Where the woodchucks go  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
Thanks to the Yukon Railroad  
We love the Yukon Railroad
