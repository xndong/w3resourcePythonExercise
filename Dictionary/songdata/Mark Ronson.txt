Un, deux, trois  
Bang, bang, bang  
  
Feathers, I'm plucking feathers  
One by one, by one  
No more skylarking, around my head  
Your information  
But there's no hiding, behind moulting feathers  
  
On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the sho'  
40k contract, take it out the do'  
Dice, symbolize my life, roll 'em on the flo'  
From your grubby hands, as you hand the grandstand  
You live a shitty life, we live a bon, bon vie  
Hotter than the book, while we watch the tv  
Think you got us fooled, ooh never again  
First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
No way, no, (the clock) it's ticking forward  
No way, it's just a cruel, cruel world  
  
Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hittin'  
With late night divisions, and lab app decisions  
But based with decisions, to fight a fricassee  
And you've clearly decided, on how to handle me  
Difficile, imbecile, is it fake, is it real  
Are we dying on our feet, are we trying in our sleep  
There's a rumour goin' 'round, 'bout the suits runnin' town  
If you look into the sky, them birds fly high, high, high  
  
Numbers, you got that number  
You're looking outwards, and don't see the big picture  
Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words  
Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings (your own wings)  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth  
We're believin' in each other, not you, you, you  
  
Stories (you with the tall tales), how many stories (so many tall tales)  
We climb the structure (you scale the ladder)  
You build it higher (you make us madder)  
We take our aim (so now we're bearin' off)  
You perch above your nest (in your charms)  
The stories in your head (it's a crazy bald head)  
That's what got you dead  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
Un, deux, trois  
No one ever does it like that anymore  
Bang, bang, bang  
When feathers fly, you deny everything (alouette)  
Un, deux, trois  
No one ever does it like that anymore  
Bang, bang, bang (alouette)  
When feathers fly, you deny everything yo

In the backroom of the Elmaco casino  
Under the portrait of Doris Day  
You and I, and a pair of c-notes  
Soft candy betting, hard eight (our date?)  
  
Not quite how you laid it out for me  
When we split up that night, that night  
Comin' out of the sunset marquee  
Before you left to deal the fine white  
  
Is this how you've pictured me?  
Is this how you thought it would be?  
We got right with the usual (mutual?) problem  
That got right between you and me  
I told you the girl would be trouble  
I said she was going to break us  
Leave us lost in the rust and the rubble.  
  
[Outro]  
Nine exits north of Las Vegas, Vegas  
Nine exits north of Las Vegas

Run your fingers down the cool  
Underbelly of the blue evening  
Crank that vapor-wagon  
Start that kick dragon beating  
Step out on the patio  
Follow where your daddy-o's leading  
  
Wrestle with our shadow twins  
Hold'em till they're glowin' in warning  
Hit that bubble kit now  
Laughin' as you breathe out, easy  
Drop another daffodil  
We can push on through till morning  
  
Drop another daffodil sail off the map until morning  
  
Baby just say no to sleep  
Bodies got to keep exploring  
Sweet volcano violence  
Vast new continents spawning  
Drop another daffodil  
We can push on through till morning  
  
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning  
  
Put another record on  
Maybe Chaka Khan or Rocky  
Catch on fire above the  
Green empire of the kraken  
Flow with the isosceles  
To the beat of six knees knocking  
  
Drop another daffodil we can push on through till morning  
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning

(feat. Daptone Horns)  
  
Where do we go, nobody knows  
I've got to say I'm on my way down  
God give me style and give me grace  
God put a smile upon my face  
  
Where do we go to draw the line  
I've got to say I wasted all your time  
Oh honey honey  
Where do I go to fall from grace  
God put a smile upon your face yeah  
  
And ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you  
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to  
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line  
Your guess is as good as mine  
  
Where do we go, nobody knows  
Don't ever say you're on your way down when  
God gave you style and gave you grace,  
And put a smile upon your face oh yeah  
  
And ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you  
Yeah, when you work it out I want it to  
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line  
Your guess is as good as mine.  
  
It's as good as mine, It's as good as mine  
It's as good as mine  
  
As good as mine, as good as mine,  
As good as mine, as good as mine  
  
Where do we go, nobody knows  
Don't ever say you're on your way down when  
God gave you style and gave you grace  
And put a smile upon your face

[Verse 1]  
Start up the engine, we're heavy and rolling  
A tank full of gas and the night is young  
I don't know you, don't care where you're goin'  
To the heartline or the heart of the sun  
My sweet companion is known as the summer  
Black as the river, and rough to climb  
Smooth as glass, smooth as dark as melon  
Cold outside, when you climb inside  
  
[Chorus]  
The city is flowin'  
I found a way the move my weary soul  
Stay heavy and rolling  
  
[Verse 2]  
You feel it duckits, you feel an illusion  
Faithful pleasure with your pretty face  
You're confused more that Constitution  
It must twat you passing freely through space  
  
[Chorus]  
The city is flowin'  
I found a way the move my weary soul  
Stay heavy and rolling  
  
[Bridge]  
I was lost and lonely like you  
All the while broke inside  
Then I found something, lastly met you  
A beautiful lie  
Might have to wait to start in on your drinking  
All of Hell's Kitchen standing in that line  
I'll be here, living in my Lincoln  
Occupying space and conquering time  
  
[Chorus]  
The city is flowin'  
I found a way the move my weary soul  
Stay heavy and rolling

Oh yeah, alright  
Oh yeah, alright  
  
When I met you last night baby  
And you let me roll the dice  
You said I'd be your lucky lady  
I hit those numbers all night  
I can't lose, I can't lose when I'm 'round you  
Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
  
I can turn your luck around baby  
Ain't no hotter hand in town.  
Promise I can make love to you all night  
I bet you never felt this way before  
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor  
Roll with me, I won't bite  
Hands on, I'm going wild  
Oh baby you got to be my axe in the?  
I can't lose, I can't lose when I'm 'round you  
Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night  
  
I can't lose, I can't lose when I'm 'round you  
Uuuh, I can't lose, I can't lose, now I found you  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night  
Oh yeah, uuh alright  
Oh yeah, uuh all night

[Verse 1]  
Burnin' up, the second Adderall  
To take the edge off the crazy  
Jump out the window, a human cannonball  
Congratulations, baby!  
  
[Chorus]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pass like two auras, 2 frozen credit cards  
Another borrowed vacation  
Girl you're a day late, and 20. 000 short  
But let it be your -lizations  
  
[Chorus]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn  
  
[Verse 3]  
Bad girl, good moves  
Big dreams, but little fuse  
You start fires that you can't put out  
Just watch it burn! (Let it burn)  
  
A lifetime of heartbreak and outta cigarettes  
A melancholy equation  
Street summer memories, of the day we met  
Could change the radio station  
  
[Chorus X2]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn

Can't get the stink off  
He's been hanging round for days  
Comes like a comet  
Suckered you but not your friends  
One day he'll get to you  
And teach you how to be a holy cow  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
Don't get my sympathy  
Hanging out the 15th floor  
You've changed the locks three times  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I'll get you  
And teach you how to get to purest hell  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you, you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you, you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself, yourself, yourself

[Verse 1]  
I'm on the guests list down the Pollsberry Grand  
That hipster doorman, he don't know who I am  
When started and [?] proof I belong, so I pass  
Some bells and bees are like grinding bombs on the walls  
Some never learn to cut the lock from the stores  
Flora's the border between paradise  
I fight on  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz  
  
[Verse 2]  
I close the rumors that are trapped in the past  
My server jeans are more like I'm outta pants  
But I don't wanna go just yet so I suppose I should dance  
The music vibes are looking at you in dread  
Like get a-burning and can never get sad  
And I shoulda pretend that it never will end inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm young enough to know I'm too young to quit  
I'm old enough to wanna get over it  
But yearning is timeless and mine is as deep as the pill  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz

I'm on it, get on it  
The troops are on fire  
Ya know I need it much closer  
I'm tradin' just a little more  
  
Step on it, electronic  
The troops are on fire  
I'm much deeper, a sleeper  
Waitin' for the final trip  
  
Come on it, get on it  
I'm carving through a letter bomb  
I need it, loud potions  
These drugs are just an hour away  
  
Come on it, electronic  
A polyphonic prostitute  
The motors on fire  
Messiah for the animals  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
We got our backs to the wall  
Ah, get on and watch out  
Sayin', "You're gonna kill us all"  
  
Ah, I'm on it, get on it  
The troops are on fire  
You know I need it much closer  
I'm tradin' just a little more  
  
Step on it, electronic  
The troops are on fire  
I'm much deeper, a sleeper  
Messiah for the animals  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
Say, "We got our backs to the wall"  
Get on and watch out  
Ah, before you kill us all  
  
Ah, oh, come on  
Say, "We got our backs to the wall"  
Get on and watch out  
Ah, before you kill us all

The only one I know  
Has come to take me away  
The only one I know  
Is mine when she stitches me  
  
The only one I see  
Has found an aching in me  
The only one I see  
Has turned her tongue into me  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
The only one I know  
Never cries, never open her eyes  
The only one I know  
Wide awake and then she's away  
  
The only one I see  
Is mine when she walks down our street  
The only one I see  
Has carved her way in to me  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
And everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain

I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter  
He's gonna give me food and water  
I'm gonna eat that and look for more  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no  
And they didn't teach me that in school  
It's something that I learnt on my own  
That power is measured by the pound or the fist  
It's as clear as this, hey  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine  
I'm gonna put it in the juke box  
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
I've got a pocket full of pretty green  
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter  
He's gonna give me food and water  
I'm gonna eat that and look for more  
This is the pretty green, this is society  
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no  
(I've got a pocket full of pretty green)  

Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
Nothing's changed, I still love you  
Oh, I still love you, only slightly  
Only slightly less than I used to, my love  
I was delayed, I was waylaid, an emergency stop  
I smelt the last ten seconds of life, I crashed down  
On the crossbar and the pain was enough to make a shy  
Bald buddhist reflect and plan a mass murder  
Who said, I'd lied to her  
Oh, who said, I'd lied because I never, I never  
Who said I'd lied because I never  
I was detained, I was restrained  
And broke my spleen, and broke my knee  
And then he really lays into me  
Friday night in out patients, who said I'd lied to her  
Oh, who said, I'd lied because I never, I never  
Who said, I'd lied because I never  
And so I drank one, it became four  
And when I fell on the floor I drank more  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
Nothing's changed, I still love you  
Oh, I still love you only slightly  
Only slightly less than I used to, my love  

[Verse 1]  
Driving quick past [?] pass is 1000 feet high  
All in sky  
Pulling the clock down in the back of some pretty girl's ride  
You get high  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Avenues into this bowl for tips  
Foreign ships as long as girls ride on their [?]  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
We're always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
Summer is gone, summer breaking fall(?)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Give em new hell, got a new record to chill in your car  
Sing along  
It feels so good, doesn't know you're too bright and too calm  
Like a diamond  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Play your [?], playing away you forget [?]  
Baby girl, you can [?]  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
We're always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
[?]  
Summer is gone, summer breaking fall(?)

Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things, what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home,  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over  
Stop making a fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over Valerie?  
  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
  
Did you have to go to jail,  
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?  
I hope you didn't catch a tan,  
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya  
And are you shopping anywhere,  
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?  
And did you have to pay that fine  
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?  
  
'Cause since I've come on home,  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over  
Stop making a fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over Valerie?  
  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
  
Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things, what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home,  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over  
Stop making a fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over Valerie?  
  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
Valerie  
  
Why don't come over Valerie?
