No, the cabs here, they can't run down to your house  
Sometimes I'll sit and wish I were somewhere else  
So let's dim the daylights for us sweethearts that we are  
Sometimes I find myself still lying in your arms  
All the sweethearts of the world  
Are out dancing in the places  
Where me and all my friends go to hide our faces  
Avenues run one way  
Streets they run the same  
Something in the air here  
Still keeps me away  
Though the cabs here, they can't take me to your house  
I get directions and pretend I was somewhere else  
All the sweethearts of the world are out littering the bars  
And I am still avenues from any place you are  
You know avenues run one way  
The streets they run the same  
It's going to take a lot of shit for me  
To not stay away

Loving you has gotten weird  
You'll see the sun hanging low down by your window  
And all the rain left in the world  
Won't bring you home again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
And trusting you has gotten strange  
You'll close the door when the cold has gotten in  
And all the love left in the world  
Won't keep you warm again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
When you need a friend to be there for you  
I won't be one who will help you out  
And when you need someone who can let you in  
You can count me out  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
When your life has worn you out  
You'll have the past left for you to think about  
And all the money in the world  
Can't take you back again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
Oh, Carol Lynn  

The bar lights and the liquor  
And the way all the bottles they shine  
  
Well I got five more dollars, drink another  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
  
The bar lights and the women  
The empty pool hall and you and I  
  
Well I got five more dollars, drink another  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
  
Write your name down on a matchbook sleeve  
Call me up on Sunday for a drink  
Call me up on Sunday tell me anything  
  
The bar lights and the liquor  
The way all the bottles they shine  
  
Well I've got five more dollars that wont make you mine  
That won't make you mine  
That won't make you mine  

My heart is sinking fast just like the titanic  
My heart is pumping blood that's turning blue  
Well, I just want this cruise and I just can't imagine  
I'm drowning and it's all because of you  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I can't even fathom  
Why you left me alone to drown  
  
My heart is sinking fast just like the titanic  
Captain would you please go warn the crew  
Well, everything is built to last, but it don't last forever  
I'm sorry but the end is coming soon  
  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I can't even fathom  
Why you left me alone to drown  
  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I can't even fathom  
Why you left me all alone to drown  
  
Why you left me all alone to drown.

I don't know why we can't talk  
Every time we try we get choked up  
Running with the feelings that gets caught in your head  
'Til I can't remember what it was we said  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
  
I don't know why we can't win  
Every time we lose, we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I don't need another who wouldn't understand  
  
Take myself with thoughts of leaving  
Running out of things left to believe in  
Running out of money and time  
Running out of money and time  
You won't be mine  
  
I don't know why we can't win  
Every time we lose, we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I don't need another who wouldn't understand  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?  
All my friends say I'm in love  
Is this what I think they're thinking of?

Trust is a weird thing  
Make you crazy  
Make you jealous  
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing  
  
And I guess I have been mean  
But I'm only second guessing you  
'Cause you won't even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you  
  
And love is a wonderful thing  
Make you wanna  
Make you need to  
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing  
  
Baby I, I have been mean  
But I'm only second guessing you  
'Cause you won't even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you  
  
Baby I want you  
Honey I need you  
I know you want to  
I can feel you  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you

I try not to drink,  
'cause if I sit and think I'll go crazy  
Desperate ain't lonely  
Though I've been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime I'm lonesome in the nightime I'm sad  
  
The letter I wrote,  
Took words from my throat I was saying  
Lay on the roadside  
I guess the mailman was drunk  
The message was urgent  
How lazy a state where you don't live no-one  
  
So I try not to drink,  
'cause if I sit and think I'll go crazy  
Desperate ain't lonely  
Though I've been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime I'm lonesome in the nightime I'm sad  

Seen a lot of things we didn't want to see  
But I'm glad we did  
I know a lot of times we fell out of line,  
But we fell back in  
  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
It took a lot time for us to find the words we'd mean  
We spent a lot time before our dimes run out, nickel please  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
'Cause we won't have to live this way forever  
It's hard to compromise the things we have  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase

Why should I hate you?  
After all, it's been so long  
Since I lived in town.  
Let it go for now.  
  
Have a drink at your favorite bar 'til dark.  
Stumble into empty baseball park.  
Strike one and strike two,  
I guess we're both out.  
  
Stumble past the record store, end up at the movies,  
Try and think of something else, but nothin's comin' to me.  
  
Stumble past the record store, end up at the movies,  
Try and think of something else, but nothin's comin' to me.  
  
You do this to me.  
You do this, and I oblige  
And I fight.  
  
Why should I miss you?  
After all, it's been so long  
Since I felt your kiss.  
How did it come to this?  
  
Stumble past the record store, end up at the movies,  
Try and think of something else, but nothin's comin' to me  
  
Stumble past the record store, end up at the movies,

I let you do this to me.  
I must be crazy,  
I must be crazy,  
I must be crazy,  
I must be  
I must be  
I must be

She's got diamonds in her eyes

So the factory girl, she listens  
For the sound of her daddy's engine  
Till the work bell sounds and she leans down  
oh, the summers here are hot  
All she seems to do is work and sleep  
And wish that she was still with you  
now you don't know where she is  
Lyin' in her mother's bed  
Or who she's sleeping with  
all the kids would laugh at her  
'cause she seemed so sweet and pure  
I took this shift because of her  
and though I've never said a word  
I once smiled and looked at her  
Till the shift boss said "get back to work"  
now I don't know where she is  
Or whose bed she's sleeping in  
Or what man she's sleeping with

If angels are messengers from God  
Please send one down to me  
If angels are messengers from God  
I wrote a letter he should read  
Been living on Faithless Street  
All by myself  
Work your whole life for someone else  
Trying to find sanction  
Christ above man  
He never shed his peace on this land  
So I started this damn country band  
Been living on Faithless Street  
All by myself  
Work your whole life for someone else  
Trying to find sanction

He never shed his peace on this land  
So I started this damn country band  
Cause punk rock was too hard to sing

Well I was thinking that I should of  
But I didn't ever leave you  
But baby I'm leaving tonight  
And there's a trucker drinking coffee in the station who can give me a ride  
  
Well I was thinking about heading down to Mobile, Alabama  
And that was just last Saturday night  
Well I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
And I'm gonna tonight  
  
'Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
There's a bad moon rising behind  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you  
  
But I changed my mind  
Well I'm a fast talking, hell raising, son of a bitch  
And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight  
And I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
  
And I'm gonna tonight  
'Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
And there's a bad moon rising behind  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you

And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight  
  
'Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
And I'm gonna tonight  
Well I was sitting  
I was drinking on a barstool  
  
Thinking how true love could come as a lie  
And I never should have left you  
But I had to  
And I'll bet you there's a man there with you tonight  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I missed you  
But I didn't  
If I came back it wouldn't be right  
'Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
  
And I'm gonna tonight

I know the world is a mess  
I like the patterns on your dress  
Would you have a drink with me please  
Have a couple or three  
I see you walk by  
I don't speak but try  
Have a drink with me please  
Don't say anything  
I look like a mess  
The patterns of your dress...  
They blind me  
  
Here's to the rest of the world  
I guess that you deserve something  
You work so hard at  
Trying to be just like everyone else  
Except people like me  
  
Well, the lights shining down onto the street  
The city lingers as it overheats  
I'm on idle right now  
Don't feel so proud  
Wait for the others to join the crowd  
  
And they come  
Ones  
Threes  
Here's to the rest of the world  
Oh, I don't know  
Here's something that you deserve...  
A drink or two  
Come on and sit down with me  
And we'll pretend everything  
We'll pretend everything  
It's easy.  

Well I found a bunch of letters  
That were written for the fellow who broke your momma's heart  
And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume  
I'll bet she didn't know  
How to respond before the blankets of snow  
Caught him out wandering alone  
With no place to go  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were houses on the hill  
And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy  
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm  
  
Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box  
Labeled tinsel and lights  
Didn't know what I was I looking for  
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts  
Eisenhower sent him to war  
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart  
And when he hit shore  
Must have been a target for the gunman  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill  
Where he will lie  
Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were houses on the hill  
And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy  
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm

Can't send no fourteen year-old boy to no school  
The only thing i learned in the years i worked on my daddy's farm was,  
"Son, you better get them crops in when it turns cool."  
In the magazines, I saw the naked women  
I heard about the drinkin' and the bars  
If my daddy could've caught me, he'd a-killed me  
He said, "You might run, boy, but you ain't gonna get far."  
I hit town or you might say that it hit me  
Next mornin' there were things I knew more about  
The woman who had taken me in said, "Country boy, you're all right."  
The same way I turned her on, she turned me out  
The first law I broke, right away they got me  
I helped them build the country roads for awhile  
They fed me two times a day and knocked me down about four  
For thirty days I didn't even crack a smile  
I met a nice girl and she said I was her baby  
She let me go and would never tell me why  
I learned what it means to be somebody's baby  
They let you lie in your bed by yourself and cry  
The miles were good but the mileage is turnin' my hair gray  
I've met some people that knew me and call me friend  
Ain't no sense in wantin' my life to live over  
I'd find different ways to make those mistakes again  
So let me say this, I never tried to hurt anybody  
Though I guess there's a few that I still couldn't look in the eye  
If I've got one wish, I hope it rains at my funeral  
For once, I'd like to be the only one dry

Hang a picture up on your wall  
Tighten all the nails so it don't fall  
In this picture, could have been a picture of my face  
Something painful, went and took it's place  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
  
Drink your coffee in the morning,  
And at night, go and drink your beer  
All along you don't feel so welcome here  
And I walk by, and you steer clear  
You always said, it'd come passionate here  
Don't like what you see, you don't like what you hear  
  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown

The banks of the river run through my hometown  
'BOARDED ON THE dirt roads, and I scraped my knees  
Well they paved the roads eventually  
With neon signs and car dealerships and diners  
The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends  
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town  
Well, I moved away soon as I turned sixteen  
Figured I was old enough to go and work a job  
Well I floated down main street, pools of car lights  
WOE BECAME me, wishing I was still back home  
The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends  
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town  
Well, Jacksonville's a city with a hopeless streetlight  
Seems like you're lucky if it ever change from red to green  
I was born in an abundance of inherited sadness  
And .50 cent picture frames bought at a five and dime  
I ended up a soldier on the weekend  
Looking for a vacancy I was NEVER to find  
Somewhere the night sky hangs like a blanket  
Shoot it with my cap gun just to make it  
Seem like stars

Well I'm saving this dress for my wedding day  
Momma wouldn't have it any other way  
She says when she married  
Her waist was twenty three  
  
I guess I'll never wear it anyway  
I don't believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
I'm saving all my money for my wedding day  
You know my momma wouldn't have it any other way  
  
She says when she married  
She didn't have a dime  
But I guess I'll spend that money some other way  
Because I don't believe I care to marry  
  
Although I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
That matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
  
Well I'm saving my best thing for my wedding day  
Because my poppa wouldn't have it any other way  
He says if I lose it early  
I'll have thrown my life away  
  
But I swear I'll use my cherry my own way  
I don't believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die

Said you came from a Mining Town  
Til they closed the mining down  
Said your daddy was a drinker  
He had a picture of Jesus on his sinker  
  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
This town's only five miles wide  
Look everywhere there's a road sign  
  
Pawn shops and places to hide  
And cops sit around hungry  
Waiting to dine  
Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Said you came from a Mining Town  
  
'Til they closed the mining down  
Said your momma was a drinker  
She had a picture of Jesus on her sink  
And Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight  
Maybe I...  
  
Maybe I'm coming for you tonight

Mirror, mirror  
Up on the wall in the back of the room  
As I walk down the hall in the house where I stayed  
Tell me something about what I saw in the face of a man  
Who once felt it all but feels nothing today  
  
Knock knock  
Who's there  
I don't know, I can't say  
Ask me tomorrow  
I'll tell you the same  
  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now  
  
Trouble trouble  
Down in my hood where it's well understood  
They love when you're bad  
And they hate when you're good  
Tell me something about who we are at the end of our days  
When our souls become one but our lives separate  
  
Knock knock  
Who's there  
I don't know I can't say  
Ask me tomorrow  
I'll tell you the same  
  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now (It's bound to make you smile)  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now (It's bound to make you smile)  
  
It's bound to make you smile  

My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
I live without you  
Your pillow cold  
I am forsaken  
I can't go on  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
If I hadn't cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that we'd  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldn't a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
Five cups of coffee  
For the years gone wrong  
If I hadn't cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that we'd  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldn't a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
My love is gone  

On back down in my hometown  
Everybody's feelin' it bad  
No new breaks, whatever it takes  
Not to have to sway it on a classified ad  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa here I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
  
Up real late in New York state  
Talkin' to my baby at night  
She keeps me warm and protects me from harm  
Love just keeps on rollin' when the money gets tight  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa where I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
  
Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on down  
Back to the shanties and the cars by the lake  
Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on back  
Back to my baby and make it okay  
Yeah just make it okay  
  
On back down in my hometown  
Everybody's feelin' the same  
Good money spent on keepin' the rent  
Sent in to the man under a week late  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa were I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  

I'm about to have a nervous breakdown  
My head really hurts  
If I don't get the hell outta here  
I'm gonna go berserk, cause  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
I'm going berserk  
Always talk the same old talk  
The same old lies  
You see the way i am  
You stop anytime you can, cause  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
H'm going berserk  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
I'm going berserk

See old Mabel walk on down the house (??)  
Pickin flowers for someone else  
See old Mabel walk down the house  
Said son, better go on back inside  
Storm brewing from the northwest side  
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin  
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive  
  
See old Mabel walk on down the store  
Buying groceries to eat  
Walkin on down the street  
  
Said son, you better go on back inside  
Storm brewing from the northwest side  
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin  
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive  
  
See old Mabel walk on down the house  
Pickin flowers for someone else  
Old Mabel (?????)  
Family bible on the coffee table  
In old mabel's house

I go walkin' under a paper moon  
All the birds are singing  
Singing you a pretty tune  
All the constellations and all the stars above  
They all start to whistling  
They start singing along  
  
The world is not a monster  
And I'm not scared at all  
Floatin' through your heavens  
The world is in my arms  
  
Oh rainy day  
Don't follow me  
Cause I'm her baby doll  
She's my cup of tea  
  
I go walkin' under a paper moon  
And my eyes are made of crystals  
Plastic flowers bloom  
All the leaves are changing  
And the skies are blue  
All these seasons of distraction  
Can't take the smile God's given you  
  
The world is but a monster  
And I'm not scared at all  
I'm floatin' through the heavens  
The world is in my arms  
  
Oh rainy day  
Don't follow me  
Cause I'm her baby doll  
She's my cup of tea  
  
Love takes care of love  
Hate just burns you out  

A pawn shop ain't no place for a wedding ring  
Six months from now what will that money mean?  
You shop around looking for memories, somehow  
The satisfaction don't come that easy  
It's a shame you weren't satisfied with me  
You're the saddest thing I've ever seen  
  
A pawn shop ain't no place for a wedding ring

I get so tired of missing you  
I get so tired of wanting to  
Compare the things that are easy to do  
Like the reasons you lie to me  
The reasons I lie to you  
  
And I wish it was some kinda explosive device  
That only you could diffuse  
Reasons you lie to me  
Reasons I lie to you  
  
Wanna live in a beautiful house  
Somewhere up in the hills  
With some people making fun of us  
You refer to us as your two kids  
Then it wouldn't be somebody else  
That you'd grow accustomed to  
Reasons to lie to me  
Is a reason to lie to you  
  
I get so tired of missing you  
I get so tired of wanting to  
Compare the things that are easy to do  
Like the reasons you lie to me  
Reasons I lie to you

On the eastern highway we ride  
Windshield wipers disperse the rain from the sky  
What's left is ivy and vine  
All the letters I'd sent back home  
Never express the idea of how a young man  
Can be so far from home  
  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town  
Take your guns to town  
  
Don't take your guns to town  
Stumble down main street alone  
Just gotten home with my hand on the phone  
I was drinking alone on the quilted (?????????)  
  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town

Red ribbons hanging up  
Tennessee Square  
Old people laughing and singing  
And dancing down there  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
Ferris wheel lights look like pictures  
I'd seen in a book somewhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
It's difficult to go on  
Knowing you're out there somwhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere

So you're a trucker  
Hard driver  
Mr king of the road  
Feelin' lonely  
Drinkin' coffee  
She had only ever known  
Drove a lot today  
Was it yesterday?  
Just a memory you know  
You can't dilute it  
Or see to it  
Roll through it  
You head home  
There is a motel with a vacancy  
There is no possibility  
You could drive yourself to ever be  
The man you once were

You can't see through an old tune  
Roll through it  
And head home

There is no possibility.  
But you could drive yourself to ever be  
The man you once were.

Can you hear that lonesome moanin'  
Is that you or is that me  
My broken heart ain't aching for nothing  
That I can't touch or I can't see  
  
And do you hear that lonesome cryin'  
Thought I made it stop its singin'  
But my hands lay there on the bottle  
And I just drank till my heart would be  
Too drunk to dream.  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
There ain't no drinkin' when the bottle is dry  
Sugar, you can leave if you want to  
I ain't got no more tears to cry  
  
Do you hear that lonesome shuffle  
Of my feet walking out of the bar  
And I stumble down the same damn streets  
My daddy done stumbled before  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
All the flowers in your garden have died  
Baby, I'm gonna have to warn you  
I ain't got no more tears to cry  
  
Well sugar, you can leave if you want to  
There ain't no drinkin' when the bottle is dry  
Baby, I'm gonna have to warn you  
I ain't got no more tears to cry

Well I tried to find something  
Something to hold on to  
I thought it was you  
'Cause I'm sick and tired  
Of trying to make something  
  
Something out of nothing  
I guess that you were bluffing  
Now I think I'm losing my mind  
The pain in my heart  
  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
You're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
  
And I gave you it all, all  
All that I could give you  
You've taken what I've given  
And thrown it all away  
  
Like it's nothing  
Never meant nothing  
Now I'm left with nothing  
What an awful price I've paid  
  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
  
You're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
I've bet all my money and that's how it goes  
You ran a good race  
But you lost just by a nose  
  
It's true  
Baby you're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
The Top Dollar blues  
I gave you it all, all  
  
All that I could give you  
And the Top Dollar blues  
Top Dollar blues

Want to cross but I don't think I can  
It's too weak here even where I stand  
Come here darling let me see you hold my hand  
So we can mend your broken halo  
  
All I want from you  
And all I want from you, is for you to  
Turn around  
Turn around  
  
Want to damage, so I damaged it some  
We use to have it all now I just got some  
Silent perfections mystery all easy to fall from your lips  
All the while lies are told to me in shapeless secrets  
  
When all I want from you  
All I want from you  
Is for you to  
(Turn around Repeat x4)  
  
Can't your turn around  
Can't you turn around  
Can't you turn around  
Why can't you turn around  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around

Hangin' in the underground  
Before a train back out of town  
Away from you  
All the lights that disappear  
In the tunnels way down here  
It's quite a view  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
Then I wouldn't hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath  
  
Locked away in your room  
On the phone with someone who  
She thinks out loud  
Thought she found the right to leave  
Think of the things you used to need  
And I'd run out  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
But I hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath  
  
Anything that you put on me  
All the things your head needs, you believe  
Read my mind 'Cause I can't say anything  
The sick heart potion  
Two parts pain  
One part true again  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
But I hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath

Yeah, you say that all the time  
And you mean it only sometimes  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Waiting to derail  
Wanting needing fighting feeling  
Waiting to derail  
Needing wanting feeling fighting  
Waiting to derail  
Yeah, you say that only sometimes  
But you mean it all the same  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Just waiting to derail  
Wanting needing feeling wanting  
Waiting to derail  
Wanting changing  
Do you feel it?  
Do you feel it?  
Are you waiting to derail  
To derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Are you waiting?  
Yeah, you say that all the time  
But you mean it only sometimes  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Are you feeling better now  
That you're waiting to derail  
Wanting feeling trying embracing  
But you're waiting to derail  
Waiting. yeah, waiting to derail  
You're waiting to derail  
Yes you're waiting to derail
