Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road  
For in Belgravia  
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made  
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?  
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?  
  
Who's that sneaking 'round the door?  
You can't come here no more  
Can't you go home again?  
She used to sit alone for hours  
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that  
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers  
  
Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?  
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?

The landlady's husband came up to town today  
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry  
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched  
The tenant's boy said "How d'ya do" then swore in French  
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul  
You should both be shut down in the coal-hole  
That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night  
And a woman who teaches wrong from right  
  
[Chorus:]  
He's a Battered Old Bird  
And he's living up there  
There's a place where time stands still  
If you keep taking those little pink pills  
  
"Hush your mouth you hypocrite"  
His humour cut her deep  
The tight lipped leer of judgement  
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep  
"Filthy words on children's lips are better, my dear spouse  
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
On the first floor there are two old maids  
Each one wishing that the other was afraid  
And next door to them is a man so mild  
'Til he chopped off the head of a visitor's child  
He danced upon the bonfire  
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams  
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man  
He's in his overcoats more than out of them  
And the typewriter's rattling all through the night  
He's burgundy for breakfast tight  
He says "One day I'll throw away all of my cares  
And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
"Well here's a boy if ever there was  
Who's going to do big things  
That's what they all say and that's how the trouble begins  
I've seen them rise and fall  
Been through their big deals and smalls  
He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls"  
You think he should be sent outside playing with the traffic  
When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic

I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild  
I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child  
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived  
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived  
  
And they were surprised to see us  
So they greeted us with palms  
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms  
I might recite a small prayer  
  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise  
  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial  
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye  
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme  
  
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams  
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi  
For if I hold my hand outstretched  
A little bird comes to me  
  
I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
  
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
The player piano picks out "Life Goes On"  
Ring tone rang out "Jerusalem"  
  
And in this pit of sadness  
Where the rank of wretched plunge  
We've buried all the innocents  
Now we must bury revenge  
  
They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a
mustang  
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars
still spangle  
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine  
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to
Palestine  
  
Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces  
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces  
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance  
Though I seemed a long way from my home  
  
It really was no distance  
And I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
  
Found myself in bedlam  
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause  
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors  
And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause  
Wailing echoes down the corridors

History repeats the old conceits  
The glib replies the same defeats  
Keep your finger on important issues  
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues  
  
I'm just the oily slick  
On the windup world of the nervous tick  
In a very fashionable hovel  
  
I hang around dying to be tortured  
You'll never be alone in the bone orchard  
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel  
  
So in this almost empty gin palace  
Through a two-way looking glass  
You see your Alice  
  
You know she has no sense  
For all your jealousy  
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly  
  
Charged with insults and flattery  
Her body moves with malice  
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous  
  
And now you find you fit this identikit completely  
You say you have no secrets  
And then leave discreetly  
  
I might make it California's fault  
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault  
Just like the canals of mars and the great barrier reef  
I come to you beyond belief  
  
My hands were clammy and cunning  
She's been suitably stunning  
But I know there's not a hope in Hades  
All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle  
So-called gentlemen and ladies  
Dog fight like rose and thistle  
  
I've got a feeling  
I'm going to get a lot of grief  
Once this seemed so appealing  
Now I am beyond belief

Everyone is busy with the regular routine  
The sniper just takes his aim  
Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed  
Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze  
You go to a movie, you go to a show  
You think that you're living, you don't really know  
  
Big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
Oh, you talk about the new boss automatic clause  
But of course they make it all up for you  
Always fascinated by the weird edge of town  
Come home disappointed every time they put you down  
Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise  
  
I suppose big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
All the buttons of my overcoat  
They have fallen off one by one  
You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink  
You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think  
Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows  
  
Don't you know big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
Tell me, me or yous been taken in  
Tell me, tell me, tell me

I was looking at the black and white world  
It seemed so exciting  
If you'd only put me back to back with that girl  
When the night's inviting  
With just a little lighting  
There'll never be days like that again  
When I was just a boy and men were men  
You never go from moment to moment  
You're the living double of a single fiction  
You're very colourful with your compliments  
As you feel the finger's friction  
It's a freeze-frame  
Still it's real life  
You don't want to look  
Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book  
I was looking at the black and white world  
Trying to name some pin-up  
Those days she was just a beautiful girl  
Now she's framed and hung up  
I thought she was young  
Up until I saw her last night in close detail  
Though they all fade away when you're so pale  
It's more than just a physical attraction  
It starts with a face and ends up a fixation  
But you're never gonna feel a fraction  
Of the way it used to work on your imagination  
When you were looking at the black and white world...

Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time  
So let the punishment fit the crime  
It's under the table  
Under your skin  
Into the cable  
Is this the death of the glory you're in?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black sails in the sunset  
White noise going yakety-yak  
All the money in the world will never bring your body back  
Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do?  
Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly  
I don't have a clue  
Oooh  
  
You're Cinderella with a ball and chain  
And the shoe seems to fit you  
You tell the truth sometimes but  
You wouldn't know it if it hit you  
Is this some new trick  
Wired up in your head?  
Do you make me sick  
Or was I just force fed?  
  
[Chorus]

Once upon a time, I had a little money  
Government burglars took it along  
Before I could mail it to you  
Still you are the only one  
Now I can't let it slip away  
So if the man with the ticker tape, he tries to take it  
Well, this is what I'm gonna say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blame it on Cain  
Don't blame it on me  
Oh-oh, oh, it's nobody's fault  
But we need somebody to burn  
  
Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup  
And the money got low, we could always heat it up  
Or trade it in  
But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse  
And you can run down the waveband  
Coast-to-coast, hand in hand  
Bad to worse, curse for curse  
Don't be dissatisfied, so if you're not satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I think I've lived a little too long on the outskirts of town  
I think I'm going insane from talking to myself for so long  
Oh, but I've never been accused  
When they step on your face, then wear that good-look grin  
I gotta break out one weekend before I do somebody in  
But every single time I feel a little stronger  
They tell me it's a crime, well, how much longer?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Blame it on Cain,  
Oh-oh, oh, please don't blame it on me  
It's nobody's fault  
But it just seems to be his turn

Now it's just you and me, my blue friend  
And you say that it's you that she's thinking of and our affair must end  
But if it's you that she's thinking of  
I think my broken heart might mend  
  
Well, it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Now I've made up my mind, I've made my mistake  
And I know that she cries for you when she's barely awake  
Well, she's going to bend your mind  
Well, I hope it don't break  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
We can watch our troubles rise  
Like smoke into the air and drift up to the ceiling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You can feel just like a boy or a man  
And next minute you can find yourself kneeling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
They're boasting of loving the daylights  
Right out of her in the small hours  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You say, that your love lasts forever  
When you know the night is just ours, oh  
  
And still I want her right now  
Not in a minute, hour or day  
And wherever she is tonight, I want her anyway  
I suppose, she never said to you, you were just in the way  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry and my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue  
Blue becomes you  
Down in the blue chair

(Bruce Springsteen)  
  
I hold you in my arms  
There's a band playing  
What are those words whispered, baby  
Just as you turn away?  
  
Well I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I wanna read your mind and know just what I got in this  
New thing I found  
  
So tell me what I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
I heard someone call your name  
Underneath my willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
  
Well I tried so hard, baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
  
So tell me who I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Now look at me, baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I wanna know it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the lovin' woman  
I play the faithful man  
Just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
  
When we stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future looked right  
But in the wee, wee hours, maybe baby,  
The gypsy lied  
  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
I'm lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on a man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

He thought he was the King of America  
Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine  
Now I try hard not to become hysterical  
But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
It was a fine idea at the time  
Now it's a brilliant mistake  
  
She said that she was working for the ABC News  
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use  
Her perfume was unspeakable  
It lingered in the air  
Like her artificial laughter  
Her mementos of affairs  
"Oh" I said "I see you know him"  
"Isn't that very fortunate for you"  
And she showed me his calling card  
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two  
He was a fine idea at the time  
Now he's a brilliant mistake  
  
He thought he was the King of America  
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams  
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals  
The words of love in whispers  
And the acts of love in screams  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
I was a fine idea at the time  
Now I'm a brilliant mistake

If I'm frightened then I can hide it  
If I'm crying, I'll call it laughter  
If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend  
If I am bleeding I'll call it wine  
  
But if you leave me then I am broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains  
  
If I am drifting, then I can fight it  
If I am sinking, no-one will know it  
If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me  
If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence  
  
But if you leave me then I'm broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains

No one looks in this place for motive or any hope  
But for the dead shot of an amber glass  
The blue light of a votive  
  
Rain obscured the window  
As the pain was dulled by the grains  
Absolved by spoons in flames  
In fear in time dissolving  
  
It's not for the faint of pulse  
Or anybody false  
Those amateurs who simply shed their skins  
So where are those traitors now, we once called patriots?  
Just like those saints who seem to revel in their sins  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassin's work was done  
But bells in hands are only there for the wringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king  
  
Trumpet sounds lamenting  
Trampling down the blooms of the deceased  
The double agent girl and the fallen priest were heading for the border  
  
Somewhere in the high command there stayed the palest hand  
Who saw the order countermand  
Erased the tape recorder and then they hung him from a window cord  
  
Swallow down that voodoo vial and stay your breath a while  
Before we spill this tale that we had spun  
And now I shall now confide all that I have denied  
Oh I'm so sorry for the things I've done  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassin's work was done  
But bells in hands bells were only there for the ringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king

So you think that you have seen her  
When you're lying in between her  
And you tell me that you don't care  
Busy bodies getting nowhere  
Ev'rybody's getting meaner  
Busy bodies  
Caught in the concertina  
  
You check her outline  
Break her regulations  
You watch her legs through several  
Service stations  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere  
  
Now you're ready for the merger  
With the company you're part of  
And you do the dirty business  
With your latest sleeping partner  
  
You're becoming  
Automatic  
Busy bodies  
Out playing with the traffic  
  
You want attention  
You try my patience  
With the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance  
  
Busy bodies  
Busy busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere  
  
Now you've given your performance  
Though the matinee was idle  
And you find that a wave of her right hand  
Could seem so tidal  
  
Just a second  
Satisfaction  
Busy bodies  
Temporarily out of action  
  
You wash and brush up  
You want to dress up  
You want to kiss her  
But she's busy with her makeup  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere [x6]

Can you be true?  
Can this possibly be real?  
I knew quite suddenly  
Do you sense how I feel?  
I long to hear you whisper my name  
'Til you tell me  
"My Darling, you may be my man"  
  
There will be days when you must go from my sight  
There may be nights when clouds deny us starlight  
Only time will tell us  
I hope that it speaks gently if it isn't meant to be  
Then again  
By then we might not be listening so attentively  
  
I will be there  
If the days bring torments and trials  
To close the distances only measured in miles  
I long to hold you all through the night  
And to tell you  
"My Darling, you make everything seem right"  
And then I'll hear you calling in my name  
And I'll answer  
"My Darling, I may be your man"

We were dancing together to a dreamy melody  
When they called out "Change partners"  
And you waltzed away from me  
Now my arms feel so empty  
As I gaze around the floor  
And I'll keep on changing partners  
Till I hold you once more  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin' happened to my heart  
So I'll keep changing partners  
Till you're in my arms again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I may never change partners again  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin' happened to my heart  
So I'll keep changing partners  
Till you're in my arms again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I will never change partners again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I will never change partners again

Men made out of monkeys  
Men made into mice  
Happy days are here again  
And all the drinks half price  
A girl with a trick and a man with a calling  
  
Trying to make a living out of your downfalling  
Trying to make a living out of anything at all  
Didn't they teach you anything except how to be cruel  
In that charm school  
  
You and I as lovers  
Were nothing but a farce  
Trying to make a silk purse  
Out of a sow's arse  
Saying 'why don't you watch me'  
Hardly speaking sotto voce  
  
I've got a notion  
I've got an angle  
Take your dreams and promises  
And put them through the mangle  
They say it's hell to finance too  
And I just want to romance you  
  
In this perpetual nightclub  
I'll be yours eternal  
Though the hours are long  
And the noise infernal  
Just one shameful act or sometimes two  
We make believe we're making do

Photographs of fancy tricks  
To get your kicks at sixty-six  
He thinks of all the lips that he licks  
And all the girls that he's goin' to fix  
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle  
But there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle  
Capital punishment, she's last year's model  
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Everybody's got new orders  
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders  
Now the teacher is away  
All the kids begin to play  
Men come screaming, dressed in white coats  
Shake you very gently by the throat  
One's named Gus, one's named Alfie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Photographs of fancy tricks  
To get your kicks at sixty-six  
He thinks of all the lips that he licks  
And all the girls that he's goin' to fix  
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle  
But there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle  
Capital punishment, she's last year's model  
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  

She throws back her hair [hands] and she shows you her mouth  
The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life  
Beauty's on a budget but you take it on the chin  
'Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin  
  
[Chorus:]  
You've got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind  
You don't know what you started when you mixed it up with mine  
Are you ready for the final solution? Oh. Oh.  
  
[They] chopped you up in butcher's school  
Threw you out of the academy of garbage  
You'll be a joker all your life  
A student at the comedy college  
People pleasing people pleasing people like you  
You've been around so long but you still don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sparks are flying from electrical pylons  
Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons  
Ready to experiment, you're ready to be burned  
If it wasn't for some accidents then some would never ever learn  
  
[Chorus:]

With a handful of backhanders and a bevy of beauty  
You're going off limits  
Going off duty  
Going off the rails  
Going off with booty  
They tell tales of fiction found on all the criminal types  
Lead to a higher ranking man or a face with thin red stripes  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?  
  
There's a piece in someone's pocket to do the dirty work  
You've come to shoot the pony  
They've come to do the jerk  
They leave him half way to paradise  
They leave you half way to bliss  
The ladies' invitation never seemed like this  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?  
  
The long arm of the law slides up the outskirts of town  
Meanwhile in clubland they are ready to pull them down  
Hey  
  
The right to work is traded in for the right to refuse admission  
Don't pass out now, there's no refund  
(when) did you find out what you were missing  
The crowd is taking forty winks minus ten percent  
You barely get required sleep to go lingering with contemptment  
Thursday to Saturday  
Money's gone already  
Some things come in common these days  
Your hands and work aren't steady  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?

I saw a girl who'd found her consolation  
She said "One day my Prince of Peace will come"  
Above her head a portrait of her father  
The wilted favor that he gave her still fastened to the frame  
"They've got his bones and everything he owns  
I've got his name"  
  
Well you can laugh at this sentimental story  
But in time you'll have to make amends  
The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality  
As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends  
Describing a picture of eyes finally closing  
As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire  
We'll I'm the lucky goon  
Who composed this tune  
From birds arranged on the high wire  
  
Who on earth is tapping at the window?  
Does that face still linger at the pane?  
I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace  
A shadow of regret across a young mother's face  
So toll the bell or rock the cradle  
Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain  
I can't believe, I'll never believe in anything again

I thought it was you and your optimist's view of the clock  
And how it's always another day  
Just after twelve o'clock's struck  
You said "Now I only want you so I don't have to promise"  
But tiny children in grown-up clothes whispered all the Crimes of Paris  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're not the girl next-door or a girl from France  
Or the cigarette-girl in the sizzle hot-pants  
All the words of love seem cruel and crass  
When you're tough and transparent as armoured glass  
You're everywhere girl in an everyday mess  
Who'll pay for the Crimes of Paris  
  
I heard that you fell for the "Hell or to Hammersmith Blues"  
In the tiny torn up pieces of his mind he's irresistible too  
Now it's hard to say now if he's only stupid or smart  
When he crawled through the door  
And poured out more of his creeping-Jesus heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And it's all here and now  
She hit him with that paper-weight Eiffel Tower  
And I tried to hold on to you but I don't know how  
And I find it hard to swallow good advice  
Like going down three times to only come up twice  
  
She's so convenient, he's always stiff as hair-lacquer  
It's hard to discover now he's in love with her  
It was her way of getting her own back  
You never did anything she couldn't do on her own  
You're as good as your word and that's no good to her  
You'd better leave that kitten alone  
  
[Chorus:]

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down  
They say you only live to see the lights of town  
I wasted my time when i would try, try, try  
'cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone  
And you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone  
You'll come to me but i'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye  
When i turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone  
When everyone's forgotten and you're on your own  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
I lie awake at night and wait till you come in  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again  
Every question that i ask, i get a lie, lie, lie  
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you  
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true  
I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why  
When i remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there  
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

Everything seems so tranquil  
Home movies with no subtitles  
Don't you wish you knew what they were sayin'  
When the film keeps playin', playin'  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Some say he is just a lackey  
Changing words while the ink is still tacky  
He's absolutely indispensable  
He keeps the other boys in suspense  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Luther is locked in a broken-down cinema  
Watches his wife with his video camera  
Sees his best boy makin' her grin  
Out of the kitchen, she's gone with the wind  
  
Oh, Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in, when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance

If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say?  
Before it's brushed aside  
Just as it's swept away  
  
It's just the evidence  
It's of no consequence  
It's only flesh and bone  
Why don't you leave it alone?  
  
If dust could only speak  
Caught in a falling beam  
If dust could only cry  
If dust could only scream  
For it's the single witness that might testify  
Could I spit out the truth?  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint  
Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints  
And in the theater curtain where they hang a drape  
Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape  
  
Before they start to wander  
Or they start to shrink  
You rub your eye a little and appear to blink  
And then she caught you staring  
She knows just what you're thinking  
What got into you was not a ghost as such  
It was just dust  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come the poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
Oh, when they're made of money  
Here comes the lamb of God  
And the butcher's boy, Sonny  
  
Well I believe we just  
Become a speck of dust...

I spy for the "Spirit of Curiosity"  
All the scandals of each vain monstrosity  
I gossip and I pry and I insinuate  
If the failure is great  
Then it tends to fascinate  
  
A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain  
Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane  
Her lovers fell like skittles in a 10-pin bowling lane  
But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame  
  
So you jumped back with alarm  
Every Elvis has his army  
Every rattlesnake its charm  
Can you still hear me?  
Am I coming through just fine?  
Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?  
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?  
It's such a shame you had to break the heart  
You could have counted on but the last thing you need is another  
...Episode of blonde  
  
Revolving like a jeweler's figure on a music box  
Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks  
Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot  
Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got  
To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon  
Tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan  
This stolen feeling  
Amplified up through a busted speaker  
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason  
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,  
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow  
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays  
He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze  
She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble  
Noe they are both living in a soft soap bubble  
  
The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide  
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride  
The timepiece stretched across a wrist  
She couldn't care less cast aside  
The scent that so repelled him that he swore: "insecticide"  
And there's a farewell note to mother  
That will conclude "Your loving Son"  
"Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees  
And names the painting "Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory"  
Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence  
Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense  
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls  
With puckered lips  
She's a trophy on your arm  
A magnet for your money clip  
The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say  
They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away

I can't believe the things I've seen  
I wonder bout some things I've heard  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
A bad enough situation  
Is sure enough getting worse  
Everybody's crying justice  
Just as long as there's business first  
Toe to toe  
Touch and go  
Give a cheer  
Get your souvenir  
  
People running round in circles  
Don't know what they're headed for  
Everybody's crying peace on Earth  
Just as soon as we win this war  
  
Straight ahead  
Knock em dead  
Pack your kid  
Choose your hypocrite  
  
Well you don't have to go to off Broadway  
To see something played absurd  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word

Don't tell me you don't know what love is  
When you're old enough to know better  
When you find strange hands in your sweater  
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote  
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Chapter One: We didn't really get along.  
Chapter Two: I think I fell in love with you.  
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three  
  
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four  
Five and Six.  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
The way you walk  
The way you talk and try to kiss me  
And laugh in four or five paragraphs.  
All your compliments and your cutting remarks  
Are captured here in my quotation marks.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday I write the book.  
Don't tell me you don't know the difference  
Between a lover and a fighter.  
With my pen and my electric typewriter  
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal  
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book...

I marvel at the wonder of it in our soulless age  
Fast flow the tears upon the page  
Don't be alarmed I am her friend  
Will I be excused if I presume  
It's more than disappointment that we share  
You share the same sorry life, the families fight,  
That unhappy blade you both invite  
This romantic ideal has a lonely appeal  
I once loved someone the way that you do  
But I had to let her go  
I live with my regret  
Don't despair my would-be Juliet

All the leaves are turning yellow, red and brown  
Soon they'll be scattered as they tumble down  
Although they may be swept up so invitingly  
  
I never did what I was told  
I trampled through the amber and the burnished gold  
But now I clearly see how cruel the young can be  
  
You can convince yourself of anything  
If you wish both hard and long  
And I believed that life was wonderful  
Right up to the moment when love went wrong  
I gaze up at the tree-tops and laugh  
I need somebody to shake me loose  
I want to know what happens next  
'Til I don't care at all  
There I go  
Beginning to fall

Figure hanging on a leather band  
Cog consults the watch he cups in his hand  
Bejewelled movement measures lost and vanished time  
Pray for the boy who makes his bed in cold earth and quicklime  
  
[Chorus:]  
So stay the hands, arrest the time  
Till I am captured by your touch  
Blessings I don't count  
Small mercies and such  
The flags may lower as we approach the favorite hour  
  
Now there's a tragic waste of brutal youth  
Strip and polish this unvarnished truth  
The tricky door that gapes beneath the ragged noose  
The crippled verdict begs again for the lamest excuse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put out my eyes so I may never spy  
Waving branches as they're waving goodbye  
Their vile perfume brings to my mouth a bitter taste  
The murmuring brooks had best speak up, it's a terrible waste  
  
[Chorus]

When Sunday morning dandruff turns out to be confetti  
And the cost of living in sin would make a poor man out of Paul Getty  
The girl in your dreams would have you up on an under age charge  
And the man of the moment is the lifer at large  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you've got something to hide, if you've got something to sell  
If you've got somebody's pride she might kiss and tell  
Or wind up with a fight fan in the Hammersmith Hotel  
You better speak up now if you want your piece  
You better speak up now  
It won't mean a thing later  
Yesterday's news is tomorrow's fish and chip paper  
  
Your girl says she's leaving and this time she really means it  
You can just look at the pictures, you don't actually have to read it  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
There's a man in the launderette and he's looking through your underwear  
For clues  
And the milkman is working through the News of the Screws  
  
He says...  
[Chorus:]

Oh it's not easy to resist temptation  
Walking around looking like a figment of somebody else's imagination  
Taking ev'ry word she says just like an open invitation  
But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But don't get me wrong  
Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Hey  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying  
If they keep on drinking then they'll end up staying  
I heard someone say where have we met before  
But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But don't get me wrong  
Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Hey

Oh, well, now you're the girl I'm simply mad about.  
Oh yes, I'm really glad it's been me. Oh yeah.  
I hope that you've been getting ready,  
Cause I'm gonna ask you to go steady with me.  
I got two eyes that happened by ya,  
And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.  
I got two lips that long to kiss you,  
And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating  
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.  
You better watch out 'cause of what I say  
Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground, sweet baby.  
  
I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street  
Everyday, all the time.  
No matter which way I try to go, my legs and my feet  
They seem to know the way.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground. Hey, sweet baby.  
I am yours from head to toe. Sweet baby.

Georgie grew to hate her name  
It sounded like a tiny man  
And the one she had said, "I can't see you  
But I'll call you whenever I can"  
  
Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep  
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions  
Though she often felt cheated  
She never felt cheap  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
It was half-past February  
And he hadn't called since New Year's Day  
Maybe he'd found another woman  
To say those words no chapel girl should say  
  
Her mother would phone and always keep her talking  
She'd try to be polite, making faces  
But somewhere in the back of her mind  
Her rival was stalking  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Her rival would always wait  
'Til the eighth or ninth bell  
He'd be desperate anyway  
And drunk as well  
  
She always liked to hurt him  
To prove he was prepared  
To love her anyway that she wanted  
So she could tell which she preferred  
  
He sat up with his address book  
Trying to think what mood he's in  
His finger traced past Georgie's name  
To someone who needed less persuading  
  
He didn't hear through her disguise  
He didn't leave her in a rush  
Just like the promise that he left  
On her machine that almost made her blush  
  
The radio plays a lover's symphony  
The number you have dialed has been re-directed  
Now she puts him on the speaker-phone  
Whenever she has company  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival

Sometimes I try so hard to resist, you say you will and I say you won't.  
Sometimes I think that you don't exsist and sometimes you don't.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
Count 10 and then down again.  
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Doing everything they say shouldn't be done,  
More fun than you can have with your clothes on.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
The less I see of you, the more I care.  
The less I see of you, the more I care.

Why must I be so lonely?  
When so many people pass me by  
I've been waiting for oh so long now  
And yet I'm unable to answer why  
I can't be made to give up now  
Can you find room for me  
In your heart somehow?  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
  
I guess I'm a victim of loneliness  
But why should this be my destiny?  
A foolish man for a lot of my life  
Shouldn't there be someone  
Someone for me?  
I hope and I pray some happy day  
That I'll be around to hear you say  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved

I want to vanish  
This is my fondest wish  
To go where I cannot be captured  
Laid on a decorated dish  
Even in splendor this curious fate  
Is more than I care to surrender  
Now it's too late  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
If you should stumble upon my last remark  
I'm crying in the wilderness  
I'm trying my best to make it dark  
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most  
I'm certain as a lost dog  
Pondering a sign post  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
I want to vanish  
This is my last request  
I've given you the awful truth  
Now give me my rest

Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell  
I don't think I can live without you  
And I know that I never will  
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death  
I can't say anymore than "I love you"  
Everything else is a waste of breath  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall  
Be careful darling you might fall  
I want you  
I woke up and one of us was crying  
I want you  
You said "Young man I do believe you're dying"  
I want you  
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days  
I want you  
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways  
  
I want you  
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget  
I want you  
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate  
I want you  
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for  
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for  
I want you  
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing  
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing  
  
I want you  
He tossed some tatty compliment your way  
I want you  
And you were fool enough to love it when he said  
"I want you"  
  
I want you  
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark  
It scares you witless  
But in time you see things clear and stark  
I want you  
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop  
I want you  
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop  
I want you  
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you  
I want you  
I want to know the things you did that we do too  
I want you  
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do  
I want you  
I might as well be useless for all it means to you  
I want you  
Did you call his name out as he held you down  
I want you  
Oh no my darling not with that clown  
I want you  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
No-one who wants you could want you more  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up  
I want you  
  
I'm going to say it again 'til I instill it  
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you

What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a girl  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, she'll never phone you  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you give your heart  
You get it all broken up and battered  
That's what you get, a heart that's shattered  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again

Hail to the taxis  
They go where I go  
Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know  
Flung under a street-lamp still burning at dawn  
I'm in the mood again  
  
I walk the damp streets rather than slumber  
Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder  
But none of their riches could ever compare  
I'm in the mood again  
  
I don't know what's come over me  
But it's nothing that I'm doing wrong  
You took the breath right out of me  
Now you'll find it in the early hours  
In a lover's song  
  
I lay my head down on fine linens and satin  
Away from the mad-hatters who live in Manhattan  
The Empire State Building illuminating the sky  
I'm in the mood  
I'm in the mood  
I'm in the mood again

You're upstairs with the boyfriend while I'm left here to listen (Angry)  
I hear you calling his name, I hear the stutter of ignition (Angry)  
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door  
So you found some other joker who could please you more  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
Ooh, I know what you're doin'  
I know where you've been  
I know where, but I don't care  
'Cause there's-a no such thing as an original sin  
  
I've got this camera click, click, clickin' in my head (Angry)  
I got you talking with your hands, got you smiling with your legs (Angry)  
Spent all my time in a vanity factory  
Wonderin' when they're gonna come and take it all back  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, there's no such thing as an original sin  
Oh, there's-a no such thing as an original sin (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)...

We play these parlour games  
We play at make believe  
When we get to the part where I say that I'm going to leave  
Everybody loves a happy ending but we don't even try  
We go straight past pretending  
To the part where everybody loves to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
Indoor fireworks  
Can still burn your fingers  
Indoor fireworks  
We swore we were safe as houses  
They're not so spectacular  
They don't burn up in the sky  
But they can dazzle or delight  
Or bring a tear  
When the smoke gets in your eyes  
  
You were the spice of life  
The gin in my vermouth  
And though the sparks would fly  
I thought our love was fireproof  
Sometimes we'd fight in public darling  
With very little cause  
But different kinds of sparks would fly  
When we got on our own behind closed doors  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time to tell the truth  
These things have to be faced  
My fuse is burning out  
And all that powder's gone to waste  
Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through  
I'll build a bonfire of my dreams  
And burn a broken effigy of me and you  
  
[Chorus]

I see you walk with him  
I see you talk to him  
It tears me up, oh, it tears me up  
And I can't stop crying  
Oh, baby, I can't stop crying  
  
I see you kiss his lips  
And squeeze his fingertips  
It tears me up, oh, baby, it tears me up  
And there's nothing I can do about it  
  
Oh, baby, baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
It's a faithless world we're livin' in  
When I turn around and there you are with my best friend  
Sometimes when you pass me on the street  
  
You look at me as if to say I'm sorry my, sweet  
And being sorry might be enough  
Then you look back at him and [unverified] a smile  
And that makes me feel kinda rough  
  
Oh, darlin', it tears me up  
I see you smile at him  
You never tire of him  
It tears me up  
  
Oh, baby, it tears me up  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Oh, it tears me up so bad  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
Tears me up so bad  
Can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Baby, please, please, please  
I'm still hungry for something I can't have  
It tears me up so bad  
Oh, oh, it tears me up so bad  
Tears me up so bad

The party's over  
Your time is up  
You've had your last pointless teardrop  
Washed down in that broken coffee cup  
This magic moment concludes when that cigarette ends  
Did you get what you wanted?  
Well I suppose that depends  
Well I suppose that depends  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you go, if you go  
Where passion is squandered and money is spent  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
  
You must see it's time that you went  
You must see it's time that you went  
Our brief acquaintance was such a mistake  
Now it seems more like a sentence  
Or something you always had to fake  
This magic moment concludes when they turn out the light  
It's not the days when you leave me  
But all I fear are the nights  
But all I fear are the nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You told the same joke to me too many times  
I wish that someone would hit it  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach the punchline  
The party's over  
Time we broke up  
It always seemed like a bad dream  
One where I finally woke up  
This magic moment concluding our mutual fate  
But if you do have to leave me  
Who will I have left to hate?  
Who will I have left to hate?  
  
[Chorus]

Sisters four and brothers three  
Hanging off the family tree  
Practicing for getting old  
Do you want your fortune told  
They're looking for you high and low  
Now there's nowhere for you to go  
So you'll just have to come out and face the music  
Jacksons, monk and Rowe  
  
Long ago when we were kids and we cut your hair to bits  
As we carried off like spoils the heads we'd smash right off  
Your dolls  
But the wind is changing you know  
Are you sure of your friends and your foe  
Have you got what it takes to carry it off  
Jacksons, Monk and Rowe  
  
As the sun beats down and life begins to complicate  
Will we both incinerate  
If we touch that brass name-plate  
  
Messrs. all, noble sirs  
Highly paid solicitors  
Find enclosed my signed divorce  
Sad proceedings you endorse  
The burden of pity will show  
In the people we used to know  
Have you got enough strength to carry it off  
Jacksons, Monk and Rowe

Third-class ticket in his pocket  
Punching out the shadows underneath the sockets  
Tweed coat turned up against the fog  
Slow coaches rolling o'er the moor  
Between the very memory  
And approaches of war  
  
Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely, not the right amount  
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town  
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all he'll get
now  
Eyes going in and out of focus  
Mild and bitter from tuberculosis  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Her soft breath was gentle on his neck  
If he could choose the time to die  
Then he would come and go like this  
Underneath a painted sky  
  
She woke up and called him "Charlie" by mistake  
And then in shame began to cry  
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase  
And then warms their hands around the brazier  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Brilliantine glistening  
Your soft plaintive whistling  
And your wan wandering smile  
Died down at The Hippodrome  
Now you're walking off to jeers, the lonely sound of jingling spurs,  
The "toodle-oos" and "Oh, my dears" down at "The Argyle"  
  
Vile vaudevillians applaud sobriety  
There's no place for a half-cut cowboy in polite society  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain

The children sit upon the stairs  
High above a valley of tears  
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no  
  
Oh no Joe Porterhouse  
Is not gone forever  
He'll be back another day  
Don't let them see you crying that way  
  
[Chorus]  
Please don't wake him let him sleep  
It' s a moment she can keep  
Like an old bus ticket or a photograph  
Resting on the mantelpiece  
While for the wicked there is no peace  
She says it's not his time to go  
Why we were nearly lovers years ago  
Now what is left for me  
Among the broken branches of the family tree  
  
Heart like an anchor  
Arms like cable  
He stood all alone on an iron turntable  
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no  
  
The sun beats down  
It's cracking the flags  
Boys who should know better  
Are stamping out fags  
Don't let them see you laughing that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no Joe Porterhouse  
Is not gone forever  
He'll be back another day  
Don't let them see you crying that way

Layin' about, lyin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said  
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow  
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
Cause the moments that I can't recall  
Are the moments that you treasure  
Better take another measure for measure  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Now you're here, I'm here too  
Could be this easy for me and you  
  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Lyin' about layin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said

He saw no tears in her eyes  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
She's telling all of those lies  
She swore she'd never told before  
But I doubt it  
  
So he bit his tongue  
And tried hard to capture his breath  
When she said I waited all my life  
For just a little death  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
  
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously  
She makes her movements mysteriously  
Slow fast or furiously  
It's a big responsibility  
With a face full of mixed ability  
Big dreams of elegance  
Singing the leaving of Liverpool  
And turning into Americans  
  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
So what if this is a man's world  
I want to be a kid again about it  
Give me back my sadness  
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl  
  
We fight so frail  
Making love tooth and nail  
You gave me the kiss of my life  
I might even live to tell the tale  
  
[Chorus:]

Cheap cut satin and bad perfume  
Showtime is almost here  
Teased up by a strip cartoon  
Laughing up your sleeve  
Sniggering in your beer  
He'd seen the bottom of a lot of glasses  
But he'd never seen love so near  
He'd seen love get so expensive  
But he'd never seen love get so dear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I know that you're all King Horse  
Between tenderness and brute force (repeat)  
  
She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set  
Hit the bill, ring the bell, never spill a sip  
And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get  
A lot of loose exchanges, precious little respect  
When it's someone else's weekend  
That's the best you can expect  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So fond of the fabric  
So fond of fabrication  
From comic books to tragic  
Through the heart of complications  
Meanwhile back in some secluded spot  
He says 'will you please?' and she says 'stop'  
If I ever lose this good thing that I've got  
I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight  
'Cause I knew that song so long before we met  
That it means much more than it might  
  
[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
You're so lovable  
  
My baby gave me notice to quit  
I just can't get used to it  
She broke my little heart in two  
Now somebody else is being the same old you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My baby has Egyptian eyes  
And a wicked look beyond compare  
If you thought I was a fool for you  
Then I must be a bigger fool for her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath  
He says he'd love you eternally  
I say please please can't you keep it brief  
  
They say they're going to bury you  
Because you're so lovable  
Put your money where your mouth was  
You're so lovable  
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam  
You're so lovable  
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom  
You're so lovable  
  
You're so sweet  
You're so honest  
You say 'I'll be true to you boy'  
But I won't promise  
Then you say you love me  
Then you show me  
As you lie there so lifelike below me  
  
[Chorus]
