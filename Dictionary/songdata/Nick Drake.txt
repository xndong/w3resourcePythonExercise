Snow in springtime, storm in the sea  
Mist at my window, no leaf on my tree  
Showers in the garden with no flowers to touch  
When will you bring us your sunshine and such.  
  
Season tell me true  
What's been wrong with you  
Won't you turn again  
Blow away the rain  
Blue season, turn away.  
  
Wind in the evening, dust in your eye  
Heart full of shadow and cloud in your sky  
Everything's wrong and you know you're to blame  
Nothing will change while you're still the same  
Cold in the city, tears on the street  
Faces are empty in those that you meet  
Lovers and losers who fail in the night  
When will it be that you'll treat them right.  
  
Season tell me true  
How much do we need you  
Won't you turn your wheel  
Hide your heart of steel  
Blue season, turn away.  
  
Countries and people caught in the rain  
When will they learn to feel fine again  
Wandering lost now for nothing is clear  
Waiting for signs of the turn of the year.  
  
Season tell me true  
What's been wrong with you  
Won't you turn again  
Blow away in the rain  
Blue season, turn away.

Catch a boat to England, baby  
Maybe to spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues I'd to sing  
Go bring me whiskey, baby  
Go bring me gin  
Me and room service, honey  
Me and room service  
Me and room service, well we're living like a sin  
When I'm not drinking, baby  
You are on my mind  
When I'm not sleeping  
When I'm not sleeping  
When I'm not sleeping, well you know, you'll find me crying  
Try another city, baby  
Try another town  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game  
Well maybe someday, baby  
Somewhere down the line  
I'll wake up older, honey  
So much older  
I'll wake up older and just stop all my trying  
Catch a boat to England, baby  
Maybe to spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game  

Strange face, with your eyes  
So pale and sincere.  
Underneath you know well  
You have nothing to fear.  
For the dreams that came to you when so young  
Told of a life  
Where spring is sprung.  
  
You would seem so frail  
In the cold of the night  
When the armies of emotion  
Go out to fight.  
But while the earth sinks to its grave  
You sail to the sky  
On the crest of a wave.  
  
So forget this cruel world  
Where I belong  
I'll just sit and wait  
And sing my song.  
And if one day you should see me in the crowd  
Lend a hand and lift me  
To your place in the cloud.

Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand?  
Who has taken you far from my land?  
Who has said that my sayings were wrong?  
And who will say that I stayed much too long?  
Clothes of sand have covered your face  
Given you meaning, taken my place  
Some make your way on down to sea  
Something has taken you so far from me  
Does it now seem worth all the color of skies?  
To see the earth through painted eyes  
To look through panes of shaded glass  
See the stains of winter's grass  
Can you now return to from where you came?  
Try to burn your changing name  
Or with silver spoons and colored light  
Will you worship moons in winter's night?  
Clothes of sand have covered your face  
Given you meaning taken my place  
So make your way on down to the sea  
Something has taken you so far from me  

Got my baby dressed in white  
Hey baby won't you stay the night  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Got my baby dressed in red  
Hey baby won't you come to bed  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby won't you please come quick  
This old cocaine's makin' me sick  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Got my baby dressed in green  
Hey baby can't be seen  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby won't you please come quick  
This old cocaine's makin' me sick  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Got my baby dressed in read  
Hey baby won't you come to bed  
Cocaine all around my brain

Green are your eyes  
In the morning, when you rise  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Love, don't cry  
I'll never try  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will not know  
Green are your eyes  
In the morning, when you rise  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day

I know you  
I care too  
I see through  
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall  
All of the people that will come to the ball  
But hear me calling  
Won't you give me  
A free ride.  
  
I know too  
What you do  
When you're through  
Counting the cattle as they go by the door  
Keeping a carpet that's so thick on the floor  
But hear me calling  
Won't you give me  
A free ride.  
  
I know you  
I care too  
I see through  
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall  
All of the people that will come to the ball  
But hear me calling  
Won't you give me  
A free ride.

A day once dawned  
And it was beautiful  
A day once dawned from the ground  
Then the night she fell  
And the air was beautiful  
The night she fell all around  
  
So look see the days  
The endless coloured ways  
And go play the game that you learnt  
From the morning  
  
And now we rise  
And we are everywhere  
And now we rise from the ground  
And see she flies  
And she is everywhere  
See she flies all around  
  
So look see the sights  
The endless summer nights  
And go play the game that you learnt  
  
From the morning

Fame is but a fruit tree  
So very unsound.  
It can never flourish  
'Till its stock is in the ground.  
So men of fame  
Can never find a way  
'Till time has flown  
Far from their dying day.  
Forgotten while you're here  
Remembered for a while  
A much updated ruin  
From a much outdated style.  
  
Life is but a memory  
Happened long ago.  
Theatre full of sadness  
For a long forgotten show.  
Seems so easy  
Just to let it go on by  
'Till you stop and wonder  
Why you never wondered why.  
  
Safe in the womb  
Of an everlasting night  
You find the darkness can  
Give the brightest light.  
Safe in your place deep in the earth  
That's when they'll know what you were really worth.  
Forgotten while you're here  
Remembered for a while  
A much updated ruin  
From a much outdated style.  
  
Fame is but a fruit tree  
So very unsound.  
It can never flourish  
'Till its stock is in the ground.  
So men of fame  
Can never find a way  
'Till time has flown  
Far from their dying day.  
  
Fruit tree, fruit tree  
No one knows you but the rain and the air.  
Don't you worry  
They'll stand and stare when you're gone.  
  
Fruit tree, fruit tree  
Open your eyes to another year.  
They'll all know  
That you were here when you're gone.

And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets  
So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.  
  
What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel  
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.  
  
And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe  
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.  
  
What will happen  
In the morning  
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window  
In the morning.  
  
Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair  
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.  
And now that the family  
Is part of a chain  
Take off your eye shade  
Start over again.  
  
Now take a little while to find your way in here  
Now take a little while to make your story clear.  
Now that you're lifting  
Your feet from the ground  
Weigh up your anchor  
And never look round.  
  
Let's sing a song  
For Hazey Jane  
She's back again in my mind.  
If songs were lines  
In a conversation  
The situation would be fine

Monday is shining, you know 'em Tuesday's rain  
Well, the days go by me like a southbound train  
Yes, it's funny thinking you will never call my name  
Here comes long lonely, here come the blues  
Well, the world's the same old comedy, you know my time is cold  
Nothing new, blue lady, I won't get old  
'Cause the deal is gone now, I'd just better hold  
Here comes long lonely, here come the blues  
Well, sun has run down, she has gone out to hide  
Yes, and now I'm out walking where the midnight ride  
Just me and the good time Charlies and the suicide  
Here comes long lonely, here come the blues  
Well, Monday's dry, yes, and Tuesday's just the same  
Maybe come down blue Wednesday, I'm gonna grab the brakes again  
'Cause no bottle of pills could ever kill this pain  
Here comes long lonely, here come the blues  
Here comes long lonely, here come the blues  

I was born to love no one  
No one to love me  
Only the wind in the long green grass  
The frost in a broken tree  
I was made to love magic  
All its wonder to know  
But you all lost that magic  
Many, many years ago  
I was born to use my eyes  
Dream with the sun and the skies  
To float away in a lifelong song  
In the mist where melody flies  
I was made to love magic  
I was born to sail away  
Into a land of forever  
Not to be tied to an old stone grave  
In your land of never  
I was made to love magic  

Who wouldn't do anything  
That you want them to  
Carry the world right to your feet  
If that's what you want me to do  
Didn't we laugh  
And scream and shout  
Didn't we wait  
Til it all worked out  
  
I know it's late  
And I should wait until the morning comes  
But I got a fear that wakes me up  
And I don't know where the fear comes from  
  
Didn't I bring you  
What I could bring  
Didn't I tell you  
Everything  
Well I will  
Well I will  
  
Some people talk about us  
Said we'd never get this far  
Let it all rain around us  
You know the way things are  
  
Fifteen miles from hope  
Another town another week goes by  
I'm fading away here like the birds  
That disappear into the sky  
  
Wouldn't I be there  
When you call  
I pick you up  
When you start to fall  
  
Well I will  
Well I will  
Well I will  
Well I will

Joey will come, to see your flowers  
Joey will come, to while away your hours  
She will tell you you're not so good for her  
She wouldn't be there if it could be that you were  
Joey has loved, never shown her tears  
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years  
When you're with her you'll wonder if it's true  
All that they said of a world without you  
Where she may come from, where she may go  
Who she may run from, no one will know  
Why she was late may trouble you some  
Still you wait for Joey to come  
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow  
Joey will come when it's really time to go  
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong  
You thought you found her but she knew you all along  
But Joey will come to say hello, Joey  

When joey first came the light seemed to rise  
Thought it came in the night and left with her eyes  
And I wish that her face would return once again  
Just one day to remind me of saturday's gain.  
  
As I sit in her city in fog and in steam  
Everything's blurred, for blurred is my dream  
So I'll leave for my terrace and tea laced with rum  
And wait for the day when joey will come.  
  
And come all the dreams that never did try  
To live on a memory or float on a sigh  
Together we'll sit in the saturday rain  
And dream of joey or mary jane.

The tramp moves on to the end of the street  
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet  
For some there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The world humes on at it's breakneck pace  
People fly in their lifelong race  
For them there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The chances they come, but the chances have been lost  
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost  
For some there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The wind sweeps up and goes back to it's tree  
The rain flows by and moves to the sea  
For them there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  

Well there was a man who lived in a shed  
Spent most of his days out of his head  
For his shed was rotten let in the rain  
Said it was enough to drive any man insane  
When it rained  
He felt so bad  
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.  
  
Well there was a girl who lived nearby  
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh  
But she lived in a house so very big and grand  
For him it seemed like some very distant land  
So when he called her  
His shed to mend,  
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.  
  
Well this story is not so very new  
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you  
So leave your house come into my shed  
Please stop my world from raining through my head  
Please don't think  
I'm not your sort  
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.

Mayfair strange in the morning light  
Mayfair strange in the summer night  
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon  
Mayfair stretching far above  
Full of fame but lacking love  
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?  
Mayfair strange across the park  
In the day or in the dark  
There's no need to walk or even run  
Mayfair faces clean and nice  
But beauty here is cold as ice  
Could it be we see the Mayfair sun?  
Mayfair strange at every hour  
Hidden frowns with mystic power  
Starry heights and golden throne  
Down below you're on your own  
Mayfair strange for passers-by  
Sights of wonder for the eye  
Could it be that they'll pass by again?  
Mayfair calling far and near  
For even trees are wealthy here  
Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain?  
Mayfair strange in the morning light  
Mayfair strange in the summer night  
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon  
Mayfair stretching far above  
Full of fame but lacking love  
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?  

Gold and silver is the autumn  
Soft and tender are her skies  
Yes and no are the answers  
Written in my true love's eyes  
  
Autumn's leaving and winter is coming  
I think that I'll be moving along  
I've got to leave her and find another  
I've got to sing my heart's true song  
  
Round and round the burning circle  
All the seasons, one, two and three  
Autumn leaves and then the winter  
Spring is born and wanders free  
  
Gold and silver bounds my heart on  
All too soon they fade and die  
And then I'd know  
There'd be no others  
Milk and honey  
Where they lie

Lifting the mask from from a local clown  
Feeling down like him  
Seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
Sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trial of the people there  
Who's to care if they lose.  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town.  
  
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes  
A sign of the times today  
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall  
People all in dismay  
Falling so far on a silver spoon  
Making the moon for fun  
And changing a rope for a size too small  
People all get hung.  
Take a look and see me coming through  
For I am the parasite who travels two by two.  
  
When lifting the mask from a local clown  
And feeling down like him  
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trials of the people there  
Who's to care if they lose.  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town.  
And take a look you may see me in the dirt  
For i am the parasite who hangs from your skirt.

I was walking thru the forest  
One cold and dreary morn  
My heart sick with jealousy  
And memories I need no more  
No I could never kill a man  
But I would do him harm  
Knowing that you're there  
Lying in his arms  
My flesh was ripped and torn  
By the bramble and the thorn  
I was lost but well-prepared  
To offer up my soul  
Because the greater misery  
Is to live with what I know  
The moon concealed by April's storm  
No bearing I could find  
Until I fell into a clearing  
And a road I recognized  
I was far  
Far from my home  
Further from her smile  
Not sure if I would return  
Or just lay down and die  
As I stood in Phaedra's Meadow  
Well the dawn did break the sky  
And from the highest up in heaven  
The Weaving Star fell into my eyes

When I was younger, younger than before  
I never saw the truth hanging from the door  
And now I'm older see it face to face  
And now I'm older gotta get up clean the place.  
  
And I was green, greener than the hill  
Where the flowers grew and the sun shone still  
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea  
Just hand me down, give me a place to be.  
  
And I was strong, strong in the sun  
I thought I'd see when day is done  
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue  
Oh, so weak in this need for you.

Never sing for my supper  
I never help my neighbor  
Never do what is proper  
For my fair share of labor.  
  
I'm a poor boy  
And I'm a rover  
Count your coins and  
Throw them over my shoulder  
I may grow older  
Nobody knows  
How cold it grows  
And nobody sees  
How shaky my knees  
Nobody cares  
How steep my stairs  
And nobody smiles  
If I cross their stiles.  
  
Oh poor boy  
So sorry for himself  
Oh poor boy  
So worried for his health.  
You may say every day  
Where will he stay tonight.  
  
Never know what I came for  
Seems that I've forgotten  
Never ask what I came for  
Or how I was begotten.  
  
I'm a poor boy  
And I'm a ranger  
Things I say  
May seem stranger than Sunday  
Changing to Monday.  
Nobody knows  
How cold it flows  
And nobody feels  
The worn down heels  
Nobody's eyes  
Make the skies  
Nobody spreads  
Their aching heads.  
  
Oh poor boy  
So worried for his life  
Oh poor boy  
So keen to take a wife.  
  
He's a mess but he'll say yes  
If you just dress in white.  
  
Nobody knows  
How cold it blows  
And nobody sees  
How shaky my knees  
Nobody cares  
How steep my stairs  
And nobody smiles  
If you cross their stiles.  
  
Oh poor boy  
So sorry for himself  
Oh poor boy  
So worried for his health.  
You may say every day  
Where will he stay tonight.  
  
Oh poor boy  
So worried for his life  
Oh poor boy  
So keen to take a wife.  
  
Oh poor boy  
So sorry for himself  
Oh poor boy  
So worried for his health  
Oh poor boy.

I got my plans  
From trembling hands  
I knew just what to do  
Follow each step carefully  
And hope they pulled me through  
My father ran  
To different lands  
And not a word we spoke  
But I was here  
To conquer fear  
And bring some glory home  
  
There's a world of hate and sorrow  
Out there standing in your way  
There's a load of compromise  
Before you die  
And each time you step forward you get burned a little bit  
No longer know the way  
To say goodbye  
Now I'm down here underneath  
Your bedroom light  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
  
I look in through  
The window  
And I though I'd take  
My chance  
I taught myself to play  
So I could be where people danced  
No higher call  
Than stars that fall  
I waited patiently  
A thousand miles of pavement  
That became my destiny  
  
You can wait a lonely lifetime  
Wondering when it's gonna come  
You can while away the hours  
Getting stoned  
But one day you get lucky  
And you look in someone's eyes  
That tell you you don't  
Have to be alone  
Now I'm falling back  
Just out of your sight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
  
Oh now I know the way things go  
And what I put you through  
Cause when they try to get to me  
They get to me through you  
  
I know it's not the kind of hurt  
That's easily set right  
And I know you got your reasons  
To stay inside  
But nothing ever happens  
When it's left out on it's own  
You locked in there with  
Just your wounded pride  
I'm down here and I'm  
Way too tired to fight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight

And now you know my name  
But I don't feel the same  
But I ain't gonna blame  
The rider on the wheel  
And I know my song is new  
I know it's new for you  
I tell you, how it's true  
For the rider on the wheel  
And round and round we go  
We take it, fast and slow  
I must keep up a show  
For the rider on the wheel  
For the rider on the wheel  
Know my name  
But I don't feel the same  
But I ain't gonna blame  
The rider on the wheel  
The rider on the wheel  

You can say the sun is shining if you really want to  
I can see the moon and it seems so clear  
You can take the road that takes you to the stars now  
I can take a road that'll see me through  
I can take a road that'll see me through.  
  
You can take a road that takes you to the stars now  
I can take a road that'll see me through  
I can take a road that'll see me through  
I can take a road that'll see me through.

As he sat down upon the train  
Silence settled in his brain  
He reached out his hand  
And touched her hair  
He struggled with the  
Same old though  
Should he tell her  
Should he not  
He felt her presence  
Everywhere  
  
Whatever comes between us  
Don't let it stand in your way  
This is what he'd come  
Here to say  
  
She just smiled  
And read a book  
Gave him such a  
Gentle look  
He felt a pain right  
Through his chest  
He pictured back to  
When they met  
Open door on a movie set  
Her brown eyes took  
His breath  
  
And every word she  
Spoke to him  
Went like a bullet to his  
Heart  
That's what he remembers  
From the start  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again  
  
He sat up through  
The hours it takes  
Passing through the  
Northern lakes  
Til the sleeping giant was in his sight  
He knew that she'd been drifting some  
Wondered where his  
Faith had gone  
He stayed awake most  
Of the night  
Whatever makes you happy  
I won't stand in your way  
Words you hope you never  
Have to say  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again  
  
She watched him toss  
And try to sleep  
Struggle with his  
Demons deep  
She thought of all  
That they'd been through  
Imagining her life alone  
No where he was  
That was home  
She wondered if he knew  
  
That every word  
He spoke to her  
Went like a bullet  
To her heart  
That's the way it's  
Been right from  
The start  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again

Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams  
So far away, so long ago it seems  
The memory comes of a distant beach  
Pale sand stretching far from reach  
It was then I found my princess of the sand  
As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet  
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet  
She came to me and I saw in her eyes  
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes  
I called her my princess of the sand  
She stared at me and my mind was in a maze  
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze  
She moved her mouth but there came no sound  
The message she brought can never be found  
But I called her my princess of the sand  
One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face  
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace  
Where she went or came from who can know  
Or if she'll ever return to help me know  
Who she is, my princess of the sand  
Sometime when the summer nights come back  
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track  
I'll look around, hope to find  
That strange young dream, close behind  
I'll call her my princess of the sand  

Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
People think I'm a crazing  
Lot about how they're-a-lazing  
Sunshine's all day long  
Narcotics far too strong  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
Cars won't stop for no one  
But don't you think that you're just rolling down  
Think you are a spy  
Gonna shoot them as they go by  
Well, no cars  
No cars  
Won't stop for no one  
  
Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway

I don't know much about love  
How it cures and frees the soul  
Makes you whole and all that other stuff  
But I was kissed by lady luck  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you  
  
Sometimes it gets so very hard  
It's like we're trying to tear each other apart  
With every scar a deeper love revealed  
Now there's nothing left to conceal  
No there's nothing left to conceal  
  
With every turn it's like we hit a wall  
Do you see it the same way  
And I don't want to complicate it  
But I hate this place  
And there's only so much that I can take  
Before this glass heart breaks  
  
And I know I've got to let you go  
You were gone so long  
And I didn't even know  
It's just that I love you so  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you

Through early morning fog I see  
Visions of the things to be  
The pains that are withheld for me  
I realize and I can see...  
  
[Refrain]  
  
That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please.  
  
I try to find a way to make  
All our little joys relate  
Without that ever-present hate  
But now I know that it's to late, and...  
  
Refrain  
  
The game of life is hard to play  
I'm going to lose it anyway  
The losing card I'll someday lay  
So this is all I have to say  
  
Refrain  
  
The only way to win is cheat  
And lay it down before I'm beat  
And to another give my seat  
For that's the only painless feat  
  
Refrain  
  
The sword of time will pierce our skins  
It doesn't hurt when it begins  
But as it works it's way on in  
The pain grows stronger... Watch it grin but...  
  
Refrain  
  
A brave man once requested me  
To answer questions that are key  
Is it to be or not to be  
And I replied 'oh why ask me? '  
  
'Cause suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please  
  
... And you can do the same thing if you please.

Who can know  
The thoughts of Mary Jane  
Why she flies  
Or goes out in the rain  
Where she's been  
And who she's seen  
In her journey to the stars  
  
Who can know  
The reason for her smile  
What are her dreams  
When they've journeyed for a mile  
The way she sings  
And her brightly colured rings  
Make her princess of the sky  
  
Who can know  
What happens in her mind  
Did she come  
From a strange world  
And leave her mind behind  
Her long lost sighs  
And her brightly coloured eyes  
Tell her story to the wind  
  
Who can know  
The thoughts of Mary Jane  
Why she flies  
Or goes out in the rain  
Where she's been  
And who she's seen  
In her journey to the stars

Time has told me  
You're a rare, rare find  
A troubled cure  
For a troubled mind.  
  
And time has told me  
Not to ask for more  
Someday our ocean  
Will find its shore.  
  
So I'll leave the ways that are making me be  
What I really don't want to be  
Leave the ways that are making me love  
What I really don't want to love.  
  
Time has told me  
You came with the dawn  
A soul with no footprint  
A rose with no thorn.  
  
Your tears they tell me  
There's really no way  
Of ending your troubles  
With things you can say  
  
And time will tell you  
To stay by my side  
To keep on trying  
'Til there's no more to hide  
  
So leave the ways that are making you be  
What you really don't want to be  
Leave the ways that are making you love  
What you really don't want to love.  
  
Time has told me  
You're a rare, rare find  
A troubled cure  
For a troubled mind.  
  
And time has told me  
Not to ask for more  
Someday our ocean  
Will find its shore.

Summer was gone and the heat died down  
And Autumn reached for her golden crown  
I looked behind as I heard a sigh  
But this was the time of no reply.  
  
The sun went down and the crowd went home  
I was left by the roadside all alone  
I turned to speak as they went by  
But this was the time of no reply.  
  
The time of no reply is calling me to stay  
There is no hello and no goodbye  
To leave there is no way.  
  
The trees on the hill had nothing to say  
They would keep their dreams till another day  
So they stood and thought and wondered why  
For this was the time of no reply.  
  
Time goes by from year to year  
And no one asks why I am standing here  
But I have my answer as I look to the sky  
This is the time of no reply.  
  
The time of no reply is calling me to stay  
There's no hello and no goodbye  
To leave there is no way  
  
Summer was gone and the heat died down  
And Autumn reached for her golden crown  
I looked behind as I heard a sigh  
But this was the time of no reply.

You have never tried  
To conceal or deny  
That this love is my ruin  
My peril and trial  
All of the promises were nothing but lies  
But now that you're here  
Why don't you stay for a while  
  
Most of my friends  
Fell under your spell  
Some fell into heaven  
But most fell back in to hell  
The beauty forgotten  
Like the snow-covered crops in the field  
Where the wind knows no mercy  
And she howls and she reels  
  
But I'm tired of pretending  
Yes I'm tired of pretending  
That I still care  
I still care  
  
And the smoke curls like a river  
To some forgotten land  
Floating abandoned the mystery concealed  
Like the moonlit shadows  
On a snow-covered field  
Where the wind knows no mercy  
And she howls  
And she reels  
  
But I'm tired of pretending  
Yes I'm tired of pretending  
That I still care  
I still care

In the bright red sky  
In the heat of an evening  
When only prisoners sleep  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man wheel  
  
She said her dreams  
What too far to be thought of  
As scars too white to view  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See a blind man kneel  
  
She sailed away  
To a blue horizon  
In floating thoughts she'd sway  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man pray  
  
She wished them luck  
As they left on their journey  
Maybe she'd join them soon  
But she lost her grip  
At the tip of life's finger  
Went home and worshiped the moon

If today were not an endless highway  
If tonight were not a crooked trail  
If tomorrow weren't such a long time  
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
Then I'd lie in my bed once again  
I can't see my reflection in the water  
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain  
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps  
Can't remember the sound of my own name  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
Then I'd lie in my bed once again  
There's beauty in the silver, singing river  
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky  
None of these and nothing else can touch the beauty  
That I remember in my true love's eyes  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
And she could lie in my bed once again  

This day is the day that we rise or we fall  
This night is night that we win or lose all  
This time is the time that we wait for awhile  
This year is the year that we wait with a smile  
If you call, we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line  
And now that you're here you can show me the way  
And now that you're here we can try make it pay  
And while you were gone it was hard, it was cold  
While you were gone we were time, we were old  
If you call we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line  
If you call we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line  

It's so easy to fall in love with you  
I know I did for a day or two  
You never noticed lost in your crowd  
Just no room for me up on that cloud  
  
Can't find no changes  
For better in my luck  
Empty are my eyes and my heart  
Cold grey days  
The nights are so long  
My heart is sinking  
Bound to a stone  
  
This old world is a bag of tricks  
A whole lot of nothin'  
Where nothin' ever fits  
In all her glory she just don't compare  
To one single tear  
In your beautiful eyes  
  
Thank you December  
For your cold grey air  
Lakes are frozen, trees are bare  
I once loved her  
Of that I am proud  
Just no room for me  
Up on that cloud

Voice from the mountain  
And a voice from the sea  
Voice in my neighborhood  
And a voice calling me.  
Tell me my friend my friend  
Tell me with love  
Where can it end it end, this  
Voice from above.  
  
The sound on the ocean wave  
And the sound in the tree  
Sound in a country lane  
Say you can be free.  
Tell me you crowd you crowd  
Tell me again  
Tell me out loud out loud  
This sound is rain.  
  
Tune from the hillside  
And tune full of light  
A flute in the morning  
And a chime in the night.  
I know the game again  
I know the score  
I know my name my name  
But this tune is more.  
  
Voice from the mountain  
And voice from the sea  
Voice from my neighborhood  
And a voice calling me.  
Tell me my friend my friend  
Tell me with love  
Where can it end it end, this  
Voice from above.
