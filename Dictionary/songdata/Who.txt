Mother was an incubator  
Father was the contents  
Of a test tube in the ice box  
In the factory of birth  
  
My name is 905,  
And I've just become alive  
I'm the newest populator  
Of the planet we call Earth  
  
In suspended animation  
My childhood passed me by  
If I speak without emotion  
Then you know the reason why  
  
Knowledge of the universe  
Was fed into my mind  
As my adolescent body  
Left its puberty behind  
  
And everything I know is what I need to know  
And everything I do's been done before  
Every sentence in my head  
Someone else has said  
At each end of my life is an open door  
  
Automatically defrosted  
When manhood came on time  
I became a man  
I left the "ice school" behind  
  
Now I'm to begin  
The life that I'm assigned  
A life that's been used before  
A thousand times  
  
I have a feeling deep inside  
That somethin' is missing  
It's a feeling in my soul  
And I can't help wishing  
  
That one day I'll discover  
That we're living a lie  
And I'll tell the whole world  
The reason why  
  
Well, until then, everything I know is what I need to know  
And everything I do's been done before  
Every sentence in my head  
Someone else has said  
At each end of my life is an open door

I've got a feeling '21  
Is going to be a good year.  
Especially if you and me  
See it in together.  
  
So you think '21  
Is going to be a good year.  
It could be good for me and her,  
But you and her - no, never!  
I had no reason to be over optimistic,  
But somehow when you smiled  
I could brave bad weather.  
  
What about the boy?  
What about the boy?  
What about the boy?  
He saw it all!  
  
You didn't hear it.  
You didn't see it.  
You won't say nothing to no-one  
Ever in your life.  
You never heard it.  
Oh, how absurd it  
All seems without any proof.  
You didn't hear it.  
You didn't see it.  
You won't say nothing to no-one.  
Never tell a soul  
What you know is the Truth.

I told you why I changed my mind  
I got bored by playing with time  
I know you thought you had me nailed  
But I've freed my head from your garden rails  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
You got me on the run  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
My mind's lost in a household fog  
Wedding gowns and catalogs  
Kitchen furnishings and houses  
Maternity clothes and baby's trousers  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
Marryin's no fun  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
I told you why I changed my mind  
I got bored by playing with time  
I know you thought you had me nailed  
Well, I've freed my head from your garden rails  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
You got me on the run  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
You ain't the first and you ain't the last  
I gain and lose my women fast  
I never want to make them cry  
I just get bored, don't ask me why  
  
Just wanna keep doing all the dirty little things I do  
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you  
Sorry, baby

They say that love often passes in a second  
And you never can catch it up  
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned  
But it's clear that the match is rough  
Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue  
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you  
  
So keep an eye open  
My spirit ain't broken  
Your love's so incredible  
Your body so edible  
You give me an overdose of love  
Just a little is a enough  
  
I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac  
The perfume nearly beats the taste  
I eat an oyster, and I feel the contact  
But more than one would be a waste  
Some people want an endless line, that's true  
But all I have's a little time with you  
  
A smile sets me reeling  
A kiss feels like stealing  
Your love is like heroin  
This addict is mellowing  
I can't pretend that I'm tough  
Just a little is enough  
  
Just like a sailor heading into the seas  
There's a gale blowing in my face  
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze  
And I can't head for any other place  
Life would seem so easy on the other tack  
But even a hurricane won't turn me back  
  
You might be an island  
On the distant horizon  
But the little I see  
Looks like heaven to me  
I don't care if the ocean gets rough  
Just a little is enough  
  
Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue  
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you  
So keep an eye open  
My spirit ain't broken  
Your love's so incredible  
Your body so edible  
You give me an overdose of love  
A little is enough

It's like a dream to be with you again  
Aw!  
Can't believe that I'm with you again  
Ba ba, bo bo ba ba, ba ba  
I missed you and I must admit  
I've kissed a few and once did sit  
On Ivor the engine driver's lap  
And later with him had a nap  
You are forgiven

Come on baby, baby forgiven  
Know that you lied  
Know you're forgiven  
Know that you made me cry  
Baby  
You are forgiven  
You know you're forgiven  
You're all forgiven!

Deaf, dumb and blind boy  
He's in a quiet vibration land.  
Strange as it seems, his musical dreams  
Ain't quite so bad.  
  
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be.  
Loving life and becoming wise  
In simplicity.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
A vague haze of delirium  
Creeps up on me.  
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.  
He's dressed in a silver sparkled  
Glittering gown  
And his golden beard flows  
Nearly down to the ground.  
  
Nothing to say and nothing to hear  
And nothing to see.  
Each sensation makes a note  
In my symphony.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
His eyes are the eyes that  
Transmit all they know.  
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show  
That he is your leader  
And he is your guide  
On the amazing journey  
Together you'll ride.

You can't always get it  
When you really want it  
You can't always get it at all  
Just because there's space  
In your life it's a waste  
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call  
  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
We all get it in the end  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
We go down and we come up again  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
You irritate me my friend  
(This is no social crisis)  
This is you having fun  
(No crisis)  
Getting burned by the sun  
(This is true)  
This is no social crisis  
Just another tricky day for you  
  
You can always get higher  
Just because you aspire  
You could expire even knowing.  
Don't push the hands  
Just hang on to the band  
You can dance while your knowledge is growing  
  
(It could happen anytime)  
You can't expect to never cry  
(Patience is priceless)  
Not when you try to fly so high  
(Just stay on that line)  
Rock and roll will never die  
(This is no social crisis)  
  
Another tricky day  
Another gently nagging pain  
What the papers say  
Just seems to bring down heavier rain  
The world seems in a spiral  
Life seems such a worthless title  
But break out and start a fire y'all  
It's all here on the vinyl  
(No crisis)  
  
You can't always get it  
When you really want it  
You can't always get it at all  
Just because there's space  
In your life it's a waste  
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call  
  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
Gotta get used to waiting  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
You know how the ice is  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
It's thin where you're skating  
(This is no social crisis)  
  
Just another tricky day for you fella

Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

If you're troubled and you can't relax  
Close your eyes and think of this  
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts  
Close your eyes and think of this  
  
Armenia, city in the sky  
Armenia, city in the sky  
  
If you ever want to lose some time  
Just take off, there's no risk  
If you ever want to disappear  
Just take off, and think of this  
  
Armenia, city in the sky  
Armenia, city in the sky  
  
The sky is glass, the sea is brown  
And everyone is upside-down  
  
Armenia, city in the sky  
Armenia, city in the sky  
  
Freak out!  
Freak out!

Out here in the fields,  
I fight for my meals,  
I get my back into my living.  
I don't need to fight,  
To prove I'm right,  
I don't need to be forgiven.  
  
Don't cry,  
Don't raise your eye,  
It's only teenage wasteland.  
  
Sally take my hand,  
We'll travel south cross land,  
Put out the fire,  
And don't look past my shoulder.  
The Exodus is here,  
The happy ones are near,  
Let's get together, before we get much older.  
  
Teenage wasteland,  
It's only teenage wasteland,  
Teenage wasteland,  
Oh yeah, teenage wasteland,  
They're all wasted!

No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
  
No one knows what it's like  
To be hated  
To be fated  
To telling only lies  
  
But my dreams  
They aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  
  
No one knows what it's like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  
  
But my dreams  
They aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  
  
When my fist clenches, crack it open  
Before I use it and lose my cool  
When I smile, tell me some bad news  
Before I laugh and act like a fool  
  
And if I swallow anything evil  
Put your finger down my throat  
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket  
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat  
  
No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes

You jumped out of an alley  
With surprise in your black widow's eyes  
I was prepared to be unprepared  
Been preparing for lights  
  
I fell right in love with you  
Into a thousand parts I blew  
I fell right in love with you  
  
I was caught in a corner  
He recoiled from a broken romance  
Taking breath after once undead  
I had a firm grip on my pants  
  
I fell right in love with you  
Through a hundred hearts you flew  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Strange that when infatuation calls  
We think that we've got real love in our life  
It pumps like the pressure in a station hall  
As the express train thunders on by  
  
I fell right in love with you  
As the blood came blowing through  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Across the room  
I saw your eyes  
Black window looking back at me  
You held a gun  
As children cried  
You touched some wires  
They shattered me  
  
I was blown into a blue  
There'd been nothing I could do  
I fell right in love with you  
  
I rose up to the station  
Smelt your scent by the door  
You stood waiting so patient  
Just one wait, then no more  
  
I fell right in love with you  
There'd been nothing I could do  
I fell right in love with you  
  
Across the room  
I saw your eyes  
Black window looking back at me  
You held a gun  
As children cried  
You touched some wires  
They shattered me

Look, he's crawling up my wall  
Black and hairy, very small  
Now he's up above my head  
Hanging by a little thread  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Now he's dropped on to the floor  
Heading for the bedroom door  
Maybe he's as scared as me  
Where's he gone now, I can't see  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Creepy, crawly  
Creepy, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
  
There he is wrapped in a ball  
Doesn't seem to move at all  
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure  
Pick this book up off the floor  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Creepy, crawly  
Creepy, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly  
  
He's come to a sticky end  
Don't think he will ever mend  
Never more will he crawl 'round  
He's embedded in the ground  
  
Boris the spider

See that girl who's smiling so brightly,  
Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly,  
She's good looking and I ain't frightened,  
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning.  
  
Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,  
My XKE is shining so brightly,  
The noose around us is slowly tightening,  
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning.

Circles  
My head is going 'round in circles  
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool  
Draggin' me down  
  
Time  
Will tell if I'll take the homeward track  
Dizziness will make my feet walk back  
Walk right back to you  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I can't get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Round and around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
  
Round and round and round  
Like a fool I go  
Down and down in the pool I go  
Draggin' me down  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I can't get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Just one thing could kill the pain  
Of leaving you  
But it gets me so dizzy that I'm walkin' right back again  
Back to you  
  
Time  
Will tell if these dreams are ? fact  
Though I left I'm comin' back  
Comin' on home to you

We're on our own, cousin,  
All alone, cousin.  
Let's think of a game to play  
Now the grown-ups have all gone away.  
You won't be much fun  
Being blind, deaf and dumb.  
But I've no-one to play with today.  
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?  
To find me it would take you a week,  
But tied to that chair  
You won't go anywhere  
There's a lot I can do with a freak.  
How would you feel if I  
Turned on the bath,  
Ducked your head under  
And started to laugh?  
What would you do if I shut you outside,  
To stand in the rain  
And catch cold so you died?  
  
I'm the school bully!  
The classroom cheat.  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet.  
I'll stick pins in your fingers  
And tread on your feet...  
  
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm  
Would change your expression  
To one of alarm.  
I'll drag you round by a lock of your hair  
Or give you a push  
At the top of the stairs...  
  
I'm the school bully!  
The classroom cheat.  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet.  
I'll put glass in your dinner  
And spikes in your seat...

Once it was just innocence  
Brash ideas and insolence  
But you will never get away  
With the things you say today  
  
But you can try if you want  
  
Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said  
Many many years ago when life appeared rosy red  
No one ever shared your bed  
Nothing ever filled your head  
Except yourself and little Ted  
And scary dreams that you were dead.  
Don't you want to hide your face  
When going through your teenage books  
And read the kind of crap you wrote  
About "ban the bomb" and city crooks  
Think about how long it took  
To get over that sudden "Yuk"  
When in the mirror you would look  
Well now my son you're well in stook  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want  
  
Didn't you writhe in anger when you saw the man in his big car  
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far  
Should have been a famous star  
But that ain't what you really are  
You could shout your last hurrah  
  
While they are propping up the bar  
Maybe things were better then  
Before you led a promised life  
Rash commitments and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised  
You fall in love with other's wives  
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies  
Angry 'cause you lost the prize  
Forgot the color of their eyes.  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want  
  
Let your tears flow Let your past go  
  
Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were  
Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn  
Aren't you glad it's your last term  
No more acting lowly worm  
You can make the suckers squirm  
When you tell them how much you earn  
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you keep inside  
Does your ego save your face "I had a go - I really tried"  
Now you know your leaders lied  
Does it stop you acting snide  
Or are you still a boy that cried  
Tears now surely long since dried.  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want

Why should I care  
If I have to cut my hair?  
I've got to move with the fashions  
Or be outcast.  
I know I should fight  
But my old man he's really alright,  
And I'm still living at home  
Even though it won't last.  
  
Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents  
Five inches long.  
I'm out on the street again  
And I'm leaping along.  
I'm dressed right for a beach fight,  
But I just can't explain  
Why that uncertain feeling is still  
Here in my brain.  
  
The kids at school  
Have parents that seem so cool.  
And though I don't want to hurt them  
Mine want me their way.  
I clean my room and my shoes  
But my mother found a box of blues,  
And there doesn't seem much hope  
They'll let me stay.  
  
Zoot suit, [etc.]  
Why do I have to be different to them?  
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend,  
We have the same old row, again and again.  
Why do I have to move with a crowd  
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around,  
I have to work myself to death just to fit in.  
  
I'm coming down  
Got home on the very first train from town.  
My dad just left for work  
He wasn't talking.  
It's all a game,  
'Cause inside I'm just the same,  
My fried egg makes me sick  
First thing in the morning.

We old ones, have seen two wars  
When you're sick and afraid  
And there's danger around  
Take a pick and a spade  
And cut into the ground  
Away from the light  
Away from the sound  
Make a trap for the beast  
Dig his burial mound  
Dig for your life  
Dig to the death  
Dig for salvation  
Till your very last breath  
Dig for protection  
Dig for release  
Dig for resurrection  
Dig for peace  
  
We old ones, have seen two wars  
When you dream of a laser  
That sears your soul  
Slices like a razor  
Burns like coal  
You can bet you'll forget  
When the rock starts to roll  
And the last meets the least  
By the watering hole  
  
Dig it down deep  
Dig it out wide  
Dig it pleasure  
Dig it for pride  
Dig it for treasure  
Dig it for stones  
Dig it for the metal  
And dig it for the bones  
  
We old ones, have seen two wars.

I used to know everything about you  
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends  
I picked the wrong girl again  
Don't see you in the crowd anymore  
I think it's you, but I can't be sure  
You're wearing disguises  
Occasionally a girl surprises me  
When she turns out to be you  
Wearing disguises  
  
I don't think you want me to see you ever again  
And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed  
  
Last week you had a wig on your head  
Directing traffic in the street  
And your shoes were too big for your feet  
You were wearing disguises  
Occasionally a girl surprises me  
When she turns out to be you  
Wearing disguises

The first time we met you were a kennel maid,  
You gave me a tip I got me forecast paid,  
You were holding a greyhound in trap number one,  
Your white coat was shining in the afternoon sun.  
  
Now we're both together,  
We're never gonna break apart, no no,  
'Cause we're a happy couple you and me,  
With a greyhound at either knee.  
  
I'll have ten shillings to win on Camera Flash, young man,  
What dog's that, it's a deuce, look at it.  
  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
We're a happy couple you and me,  
With a greyhound at either knee.  
  
We go to the dog track on Saturday night,  
We put all our money on a dog that we like,  
A kiss and a cuddle, a hot meat pie,  
Two dollar tickets and a starry sky.  
  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,

Yes it's you little darling,

Now it's you little darling,

Girl, where's me wage packet ?????,  
Ah I'll put twenty-five knicker please on Gallop Printer,  
Oh, I hope the wife don't find out,  
Yes, it's sure to win, isn't it,  
Yes, I know, it's a good dog, I saw it run at White City,  
Just last week, broke the record, Gallop Printer,  
Nice dog, yes, lovely form, lovely buttocks.

Don't go and hide  
Yesterday you were my girlfriend  
If you do  
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind  
  
There's a stone in my shoe  
So I can't catch you up  
My head's in a lion's mouth  
Wants to eat me up  
Right here today  
Don't look away  
I've always been true  
And I still love you  
So don't look away  
There's a lot you can do  
To get me away  
You've got to stay  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
  
I once heard you say  
If I ever was down you would help me  
Now my head's being chewed up  
You pretend that you don't see  
  
There's a stone in my shoe  
So I can't catch you up  
My head's in a lion's mouth  
Wants to eat me up

And I still love you  
So don't look away

Hyde, Hyde.  
Someone is spending my money for me,  
The money I earn I never see,  
In all things I do he interferes,  
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears.  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
When I drink my potion my character changes,  
My whole mind and body rearranges,  
This strange transformation takes place in me,  
Instead of myself everybody can see...  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
Whenever you're with me make sure it's still me,  
I've got to the stage I can't tell which I'll be,  
The loveable fellow who'll buy you a drink,  
Then when he's drunk his he'll change in a wink into...  
  
Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.

There are men high up there fishing,  
Haven't seen quite enough of the world,  
I ain't seen a sign of my heroes,  
And I'm still diving down for pearls.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean,  
Let me get back to the sea.  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,  
Let the tide in, and set me free.  
  
I'm flowing under bridges,  
Then flying through the sky,  
I'm traveling down cold metal  
Just a tear in baby's eye.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean  
Let me get back to the sea  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm  
Let the tide in, rush over me.  
  
I am not the actor  
This can't be the scene  
But I am in the water,  
As far as I can see...  
  
I'm remembering distant memories  
Recalling other names.  
Rippling over canyons,  
And boiling in the train.  
  
Let me etc.

3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,  
With life's best side on the downward slope,  
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope,  
My girl's with me and all my friends can see.  
  
Here I am again,  
Early morning cold taxi.  
Early morning cold taxi.  
  
Done it before, do it again,  
Know from experience it's not in vain,  
She's the best I've had, I cannot see, what someone else can do to me.  
It's a long way home but love's so warm, you'll see.  
  
Here I am again,  
Early morning cold taxi.  
Early morning cold taxi.  
  
Early morning cold taxi,  
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out,  
Early morning cold taxi,  
'Though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt.  
  
3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,  
One day we'll be wed,  
This I know for it's what she said,  
Then no more will my mind be uneasy.

The sun shines  
And people forget  
The spray flies as the speedboat glides  
And people forget  
Forget they're hiding

And people forget  
The snow packs as the skier tracks  
And people forget  
Forget they're hiding.

Eminence front - It's a put on.

Dress to kill.  
  
The drinks flow  
People forget  
That big wheel spins, the hair thins  
People forget  
Forget they're hiding  
The news slows  
People forget  
The shares crash, hopes are dashed  
People forget  
Forget they're hiding.

Come on join the party

You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine,  
You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine,  
Every time she starts to lovin'  
She brings eyesight to the blind.  
  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
Every time we start shakin'  
The dumb begin to talk.  
  
She's got the power to heal you never fear

Just a word from her lips  
And the deaf begin to hear.

It may be warm but the snow is going to fall,  
Enough to cover us all.  
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself.  
  
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt,  
The snow we never felt.  
We're young and hardy again, we bow to weaker men.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself.  
  
The more we learn, the less we believe to be true.  
The more we prove, the more remains to be proved.  
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself, inside yourself.  
  
Faith in something bigger (x 8)

I'm glad you won't see or hear me

Now I'm doing what I want to

Went to the fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Said she'd take a look at my palm  
Said "Son, do you feel kind of warm?"  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said "You're in love"  
  
Said it could not be so  
Not with all the girls I know  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love

They kicked me out [Repeat: x4]  
  
You must've heard of them, a kind of screwed-up blend  
Split personality  
Two sides to fight and argue all night  
over coffee or tea  
  
Well, that's okay, I wouldn't mind, two say  
or even three, and that's no joke  
But with a four-way split, the pocket money's hit  
And all of me is broke  
  
I got four heads inside my mind  
Four rooms I'd like to lie in  
Four selves I want to find  
And I don't know which one is me  
  
I get four papers in the box each day  
Four girls ringing that I'm trying to date  
I look in the mirror and see my face  
But I don't know which one is me (I don't know which one is me)  
  
He kicked me out, He kicked me out  
He kicked me out, He kicked me out  
  
I wake up over here and then I'm over here  
I'm trying to brush my teeth  
It's little things that are hard  
Like starting up the car when I'm still underneath  
  
I get along alright, in fact it's fun at night  
I get four-dimensional dreams  
But I have to think before I take a drink  
I get hungover times sixteen  
  
There are four records I want to buy  
Four highs I'd like to try  
Every letter I get I send four replies  
And they don't know which one's from me  
  
I've got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat  
Four directions and just two feet  
I've got a very very secret identity  
And I don't know which one is me  
  
You think it's funny, I can tell  
Well, you don't understand too well  
I get so lonely and turned around  
But I can't let it bring me down  
  
I got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat  
Four directions and just two feet  
Got a very very secret identity  
And I don't know which one is me

I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well  
With the chords I'm playing  
I can't pretend there's any meaning here  
Or in the things I'm saying  
  
But I'm in tune  
Right in tune  
I'm in tune  
And I'm gonna tune  
  
Right in on you  
Right in on you  
Right in on you  
  
I get a little tired of having to say  
"Do you come here often?"  
But when I look in your eyes and see the harmonies  
And the heartaches soften  
  
I'm getting in tune  
Right in tune  
I'm in tune  
And I'm gonna tune  
  
Right in on you (right in on you)  
Right in on you (right in on you)  
Right in on you  
  
I've got it all here in my head  
There's nothing more needs to be said  
I'm just bangin' on my old piano  
I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
  
(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)  
Getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)  
Yeah, I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow  
(Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)  
  
I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well  
With the way I'm feeling  
There's a symphony that I hear in your heart  
Sets my head a-reeling  
  
But I'm in tune  
Right in tune  
I'm in tune  
And I'm gonna tune  
  
Right in on you (right in on you)  
Right in on you (right in on you)  
Right in on you  
  
Baby, with you  
Baby, with you  
Baby, with you  
Baby, with you  
Baby, with you  
  
I've got it all here in my head  
There's nothing more needs to be said  
I'm just bangin' on my old piano  
I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow

She wasn't a fool  
That glittering girl  
She followed the rules  
That shimmering pearl  
  
Said the rules mama preaches  
Go down when they break  
The themes mama teaches  
You just gotta shake  
  
But she wasn't a fool  
That slender love figure  
She followed her rules  
And made money bigger  
  
She wasn't a fool  
That shining young woman  
She followed her rules  
She's crying for no man  
  
Said the rules mama preaches  
Go down when they're broken  
She explodes into peaches  
And cries when I've spoken  
  
She wasn't a fool  
That goddess of hell  
There are no mother's rules  
She makes them herself  
  
And I was down upon my knees  
To beg her surrender up to me  
  
Something inside her  
Told her she shouldn't  
Tried and alight her  
But the girl wouldn't  
  
She wasn't a fool  
But love flowed from her face  
She's not scared of me  
She's afraid of disgrace  
  
She wasn't a fool  
That female for our world  
She followed her rules  
That glittering girl (x4)

Your out-of-tune piano, sentimental photographs,  
A million little memories, a million little laughs.  
  
The wing of the airplane has just caught on fire,  
I say without reservation we ain't getting no higher.  
  
All you wanted from me, all I had to give,  
Nothing matters you'll see, when in paradise you live,  
The plane is diving faster, we're getting near the ground,  
Nobody is screaming, no one makes a sound.  
  
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl [Repeat: x4]

And when the world began  
I'd been asleep forever  
I opened one eye  
'Twas then it was I  
Got the whim to wake  
  
And when the weight of space  
Rolled like it was an ocean  
One became one  
Father and son  
Watched the sunrise break  
  
And as the ocean warmed  
And from this dream we woke  
One sang to greet the dawn  
One pursed his lips and spoke  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say  
  
I heard the heavens sing  
Predicting Marty Robbins  
I knew I'd find  
Music and time  
Were the perfect plan  
  
I watched my son sail on  
A little ship a-bobbin'  
I had to grow  
I needed to know  
Exactly who I am  
  
And as the ocean warmed  
And from this dream we woke  
One sang to greet the dawn  
One pursed his lips and spoke  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say

I'm goin' home  
And when I want to go home  
I'm goin' mobile  
Well, I'm gonna find a home  
And we'll see how it feels  
Goin' mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
I can pull up by the curb  
I can make it on the road  
Goin' mobile  
I can stop in any street  
And talk with people that we meet  
Goin' mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
Out in the woods  
Or in the city  
It's all the same to me  
When I'm drivin' free, the world's my home  
When I'm mobile  
  
Hee, hoo!  
beep beep!  
  
Play the tape machine  
Make the toast and tea  
When I'm mobile  
Well I can lay in bed  
With only highway ahead  
When I'm mobile  
Keep me movin'  
  
Keep me movin'  
Over 50  
Keep me groovin'  
Just a hippie gypsy  
  
Come on move now  
Movin'  
Keep me movin', yeah  
  
Keep me movin', groovin', groovin', yeah  
Movin', Yeah  
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, ...  
  
I don't care about pollution  
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy  
That's my solution  
Watch the police and the tax man miss me  
I'm mobile  
Oooooh, yeah, hee!  
  
Mobile, mobile, mobile yeah

You're alone above the street somewhere  
Wondering how you'll ever count out there  
  
You can walk, you can talk, you can fight  
But inside you've got something to write  
In your hand you hold your only friend  
Never spend your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
  
When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up  
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge  
When the words are immobile until you sit down  
Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found  
Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way  
You must really have something  
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away  
Important to say  
  
When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream  
And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean  
But it suddenly comes after years of delay  
You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play  
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white  
Then you can be sure, you can open the door  
Get off of the floor tonight  
You have something to write  
  
When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you  
But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you  
You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet  
You've got a head start away from the street  
  
But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?  
Could be there's just one thing left in the end  
Your guitar and your pen  
  
When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon  
And she says that she'd like it "with more of a tune"  
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed  
Then you stick it together and start writing again  
And you know that it won't be too long 'til your back  
To bring her some money, she's calling you "honey"  
Stashed in a bloody great sack  
In your Cadillac  
  
You're alone  
You're alone  
  
You're alone above the street somewhere  
Wondering how you'll ever count out there  
  
You can walk, you can talk, you can fight  
But inside you've got something to write  
In your hand you hold your only friend  
Never spend your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
Your guitar or your pen  
  
Never spend your guitar or your pen

On top of the sky is a place where you go if you've done nothing wrong  
If you've done nothing wrong  
And down in the ground is a place where you go if you've been a bad boy  
If you've been a bad boy  
  
Why can't we have eternal life  
And never die  
Never die?  
In the place up above you grow feather wings and you fly round and round  
With a harp singing hymns  
  
And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail and you carry a fork  
And burn away  
  
Why can't we have eternal life, And never die  
Never die?

You can pack up your bags and go looking,  
For all things that need to be done,  
Or you can spend all your life not thinking,  
Never ending what you begun.  
  
You take a step in the right direction,  
But the man knocks us down on the floor,  
And although he may think we are broken,  
We'll get up and take two steps more.  
  
It's your life to do what you want to,  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,  
And whatever you think of the reason,  
You bet your life you're here for more.  
  
It's your life to do what you want to,  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,  
And whatever you think of the reason,  
You bet your life you're here for more.  
  
You may think that you're pretty good people,  
And you run at an even score,  
But whatever you think you are here for,  
You bet your life you're here for more.

He slumped to the wall with a moan

I'm feelin' so good right now  
There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past  
He buys me a brandy  
But could it be he's really just after my ass?  
  
He likes the clothes I wear  
He says he likes a man who's dressed in season  
But no-one else ever stares, he's being so kind  
What's the reason?  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
You can count 'em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
Suddenly it's the silver screen  
And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out  
Everybody hears me  
But I look like a fool now  
With a cry and I shy out  
She knows all of my friends  
But it's nice to find a woman who's keen on living  
Now I think I've reached the end  
I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate?  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
It's all like a dream you know  
When you're still up early in the morning  
And you all sit together to watch the 1 come through  
But things don't look so good  
When you could use a bit of warning  
Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?  
  
When I first signed a contract  
It was more than a handshake then  
I know it still is  
But there's a plain fact  
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs  
I get the willies  
People know nothing about their own soft gut  
So how come they can sum us up  
Without suffering all the hype we've known  
How come they bum us up  
  
How many friends have I really got?  
You can count 'em on one hand  
How many friends have I really got?  
How many friends have I really got?  
That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise  
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes  
  
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles  
Oh yeah  
  
If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played  
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way  
  
Well, here's a poke at you  
You're gonna choke on it too  
You're gonna lose that smile  
Because all the while  
  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles  
Oh yeah  
  
You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away  
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say  
  
That you still want me  
Well, that's as may be  
But you gotta stand trial  
Because all the while  
  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles  
Oh yeah  
  
I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise  
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes  
  
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles  
Oh yeah  
  
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days  
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze  
  
Well, here's a poke at you  
You're gonna choke on it too  
You're gonna lose that smile  
Because all the while  
  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles  
And miles and miles and miles and miles  
  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles  
I can see for miles and miles

Got a feeling inside (Can't explain)  
It's a certain kind (Can't explain)  
I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)  
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)  
  
I said (Can't explain)  
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)  
  
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue  
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true  
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again  
I know what it means, but  
  
Can't explain  
I think it's love  
Try to say it to you  
When I feel blue  
  
But I can't explain (Can't explain)  
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (Can't explain)  
  
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad  
The things you've said have got me real mad  
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again  
I know what it means but  
  
Can't explain  
I think it's love  
Try to say it to you  
When I feel blue  
  
But I can't explain (Can't explain)  
Forgive me one more time, now (Can't explain)  
  
I said I can't explain, yeah  
You drive me out of my mind  
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe  
I said I can't explain

I'm a million ages past you  
A million years behind you too  
A thousand miles up in the air  
A trillion times I've seen you there  
  
Your hair is golden, mine is grey  
You walk on grass, it turns to hay  
You blood is blue and mine is red  
My body strains, but the nerves are dead  
  
I can't reach you  
I've strained my eyes  
I can't reach you  
I've split my sides  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
The distances grow greater now  
You drink champagne and past me plow  
You fly your plane right over my head  
You're still alive and I'm nearly dead  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
Once I caught a glimpse  
Of your unguarded, untouched heart  
Our fingertips touched and then  
My mind tore us apart  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you

There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm going,  
There's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowing,  
Don't think about the way I dress, you can fit me on a labeled shelf,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
Ooh I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,  
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
Don't listen to the words I say, weighing up if I'm enlightened,  
Don't shiver as you pass me by, 'cause mister I'm the one who's frightened,  
The police just came and left, they wanted me and no one else,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
I said I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,  
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
Do you remember me, I don't remember you,  
Do you still love me, you know I think you do,  
I have been gone, and some prison warder knows my scream,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
There's only five who know my real name,  
And my mother don't believe they know it,  
What she called me is the way I'm staying,  
And no one'll ever know it,  
Come on all of you big boys, come on all of you elves,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
I said I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
And I don't mind if I cry once in a while.

Now when I was a little boy 'bout the age of five  
I had something in my pocket  
Keep a lot of folks alive  
Now I'm a man, I'm age twenty-one  
You know baby, we can have a lotta fun  
I'm a man, I spell, M A N  
Man  
All you pretty women, stand in line  
I can make love to you baby, in an hour's time  
I'm a man, spelled M A N  
Man  
I'm going back down to Kansas  
To bring back the second cousin  
Little John, the conqueroo  
I'm a man, spelled M A N  
Man  
The line I shoot will never miss  
The way I make love to 'em, they can't resist  
I'm a man, I spell M A N  
Man  

Tommy:  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm free-I'm free,  
And freedom tastes of reality,  
I'm free-I'm free,  
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me.  
  
If I told you what it takes  
To reach the highest high,  
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'  
But you've been told many times before  
Messiahs pointed to the door  
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How can we follow?  
How can we follow?

Every year is the same  
And I feel it again  
I'm a loser, no chance to win  
Leaves start fallin'  
Come down is callin'  
Loneliness starts sinking in  
  
But I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
Where do you get  
Those blue, blue jeans  
Faded, patched secret so tight?  
Where do you get  
That walk oh so lean?  
Your shoes and your shirt all just right  
  
I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
I got a Gibson  
Without a case  
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face  
Ill fitting clothes  
And I blend in the crowd  
Fingers too clumsy  
Voice too loud  
  
But I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
I'm the one  
  
I'm the one!

I'm the face baby, is that clear,  
I'm the face baby, is that clear,  
I'm the face if you want it,  
I'm the face if you want it, dear,  
All the others are third class tickets by me, baby, is that clear.  
  
I'm the big wheel baby, won't you roll with me,  
I'm the big wheel baby, won't you roll with me,  
So many cats down the scene, honey,  
????? hardly see.  
  
Wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes,  
I wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes,  
So many tickets down the scene honey,  
They're like to blow a fuse.  
  
I'm the face baby, is that clear,  
I'm the face baby, is that clear,  
I'm the face if you want it,  
I'm the face if you want it, dear,  
All the others are third class tickets by me baby, is that clear.

Imagine a man  
Not a child of any revolt  
But a plain man tied up in life  
  
Imagine the sand  
Running out as he struts  
Parading and fading, ignoring his wife  
  
Imagine a road  
So long looking backwards  
You can't see where it really began  
  
Imagine a load  
So large and so smooth  
That against it a man is an ant  
  
Then you will see the end  
You will see the end  
  
Imagine events  
That occur everyday  
Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit  
  
Imagine a fence  
Around you as high as prevention  
Casting shadows, you can't see your feet  
  
Imagine a girl  
You long for and have  
And the body of chalky perfection and truth  
  
Imagine a past  
Where you wish you had lived  
Full of heroes and villains and fools  
  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
Oh yeah  
  
Imagine a man  
Not a child of any revolt  
But a man of today feeling new  
  
Imagine a soul  
So old it it is broken  
And you will know your invention is you  
  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
You will see the end  
You will see the end  
Oh yeah

Ain't it funny how they're all Cleopatra  
When you gaze into their past  
When you find out about their birth signs  
You realize there was no need to have asked  
  
All the history of a soul in torment  
Ingrained in a hand or a face  
Ain't it funny how they all fire the pistol  
At the wrong end of the race  
  
I am going round and round  
I am going round and round  
I am going round and round  
I am going round  
Going round and round  
  
There's a man going through your dust bin  
Only this time he's looking for food  
There's a tear in his eye, you don't know him  
Oh but you know what he's going through  
  
Ain't it funny that you can't seem to help him  
Feelin' sick as he staggers away  
Is it weird that you hate a stranger  
Can a detail correct your dismay  
  
I am going round and round  
I am going round and round  
I am going round and round  
I am going round  
Going round and round

Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you can't go wrong  
  
Take your time  
No need to hurry  
Don't have to worry  
Cause it won't take long  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there ain't no rules  
Drive your super-stock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag.  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...  
Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you can't go wrong  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there ain't no rules  
Drive your super-stock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag.  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...  
  
In the city, into the city...  
  
Lyrics by Mickjagger43

In the ether  
I hang suspended  
I wait for you  
And I know you're near  
In this high heaven  
My world's upended  
I feel no passion  
I feel no fear  
  
I'm dizzy with love  
But you never appear  
In the gloom of this room  
Of this cell down here  
  
I know this place  
Isn't truly real  
And that like my love  
It expands and sprays  
The light will find me  
Will bend toward me  
Yet I'm marooned  
In a billion days  
  
I'm drunk with you  
And I can't explain  
Who or where I am  
Or how I'm in pain  
  
Rocking and rocking me  
Rhythm is shocking me  
Just like a child in your fist  
You are knocking me  
Rocking and rocking  
Autistic, caged I am  
Rocking and rocking  
And rocking enraged  
  
I am drunk with you  
And I can't explain  
Who or where I am  
Or how I'm in pain  
  
In the ether  
In the ether  
  
In the ether  
I wait for you  
Hanging in this mist  
That I know's unreal  
There is nothing there  
There's no you, no me  
Even though it's crazy  
I still appeal  
  
This is heavenly hell  
I appear insane  
I have no idea  
Who there is to blame

I see a man without a problem  
I see a country always starved,  
I hear the music of a heartbeat,  
I walk, and people turn and laugh.  
  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is in my head here at the start?  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head, or in my heart?  
  
I pick up phones and hear my history.  
I dream of all the calls I miss.  
I try to number those who love me,  
And find exactly what the trouble is.  
  
Is it in my head etc.  
I feel I'm being followed,  
My head is empty  
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence.  
Make love to a stranger  
Just asking for directions  
Turn from being help to being questions.  
  
I see a man without a problem.

So, I'm thinking about my life now

Deal me another hand, Lord, this one's very hard

You were under the impression  
That when you were walking forward  
You'd end up further onward  
But things ain't quite that simple.  
  
You got altered information  
You were told to not take chances  
You missed out on new dances  
Now you're losing all your dimples.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut and slim and checked,  
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck.  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat,  
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
Love reign o'er me.  
Love reign o'er me.  
Love.  
  
I've had enough of living  
I've had enough of dying  
I've had enough of smiling  
I've had enough of crying  
I've taken all the high roads  
I've squandered and I've saved  
I've had enough of childhood  
I've had enough of graves...  
  
Get a job and fight to keep it,  
Strike out to reach a mountain.  
Be so nice on the outside  
But inside keep ambition  
  
Don't cry because you hunt them  
Hurt them first they'll love you  
There's a millionaire above you  
And you're under his suspicion.  
  
I've had enough of dance halls  
I've had enough of pills  
I've had enough of street fights  
I've seen my share of kills  
I'm finished with the fashions  
And acting like I'm tough  
I'm bored with hate and passion  
I've had enough of trying to love.

I've known no war  
I've known no war

They belong to a lone broken sailor

His provinces now

Grace, space, race  
Everything they've seen you have seen,  
Everywhere they've been you have been,  
Everything they've done you have been and done already.  
  
Every lovely spot near or far,  
You can reach them too in your car,  
Or you might be there now if you own a jag already.  
  
The radio blasting, the girls are glancing,  
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials.  
  
Grace space race.  
Grace space race.  
Jaguar, jaguar, jaguar, jaguar.

This girl with eyes like gems  
And cool reactions to your lies  
Lies

Down at the Astoria the scene was changing  
Bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating  
We were the first band to vomit at the bar  
And find the distance to the stage too far  
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'-clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive  
  
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving  
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins  
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong  
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone  
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive  
  
Landslide, rocks are falling, falling down upon our very heads  
We tried but you were yawning. Look again  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
  
The place is really jumping to the high watt amps  
'Til a twenty inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps  
In the blackout they danced right into the aisle  
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles  
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive

Layin' on my back  
In the newly mown grass  
Rain is coming down  
But I know the clouds will pass  
You bring me tea  
Say "the babe's a-sleepin'"  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
  
Black ash from the foundry  
Hangs like a hood  
But the air is perfumed  
By the burning firewood  
The seeds are bursting  
The spring is a-seeping  
Lay down my darling  
Love ain't for keeping  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
Lay down my darling  
Love ain't for keeping

Surrounded by people  
A real heavy crowd  
But inside I still feel lonely now  
  
Should I get away  
From the high heels so proud  
Is there something different life can show me now  
  
First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again  
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said  
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge  
Fourth chance - Ooh, I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge  
  
And I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Ooh, down  
  
I'm not a loser  
But did I really win?  
Can I afford to go through it all again?  
  
I hope I don't sound  
As immature as I feel  
But when I get wise, I'll give you a call, my friend  
  
First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again  
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said  
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge  
Fourth chance - I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge  
  
Now I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Ooh, down (down)  
  
Love is coming down on me, ooh yeah  
Love is burning, teaching, turning out in me  
Love is coming down, down  
Down, down  
Down, down  
  
I'm not a loser  
But did I really win?  
I'm lookin' forward to doin' it all again

(Pete's theme) Only love  
Can make it rain  
The way the beach is kissed by the sea.  
Only love  
Can make it rain  
Like the sweat of lovers'  
Laying in the fields.  
  
Love, reign o'er me.  
Love, reign o'er me, rain on me.  
  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That makes you yearn to the sky.  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That falls like tears from on high.  
  
Love Reign O'er me.  
  
On the dry and dusty road  
The nights we spend apart alone  
I need to get back home to cool cool rain.  
The nights are hot and black as ink  
I can't sleep and I lay and I think  
Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain.

Every day I get in the queue (Too much, Magic Bus)  
To get on the bus that takes me to you (Too much, Magic Bus)  
I'm so nervous, I just sit and smile (Too much, Magic Bus)  
You house is only another mile (Too much, Magic Bus)  
  
Thank you, driver, for getting me here (Too much, Magic Bus)  
You'll be an inspector, have no fear (Too much, Magic Bus)  
I don't want to cause no fuss (Too much, Magic Bus)  
But can I buy your Magic Bus? (Too much, Magic Bus)  
  
Heck no you can't have it.  
  
I don't care how much I pay (Too much, Magic Bus)  
I want to drive my bus to my baby each day (Too much, Magic Bus)  
  
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it ... (You can't have it!)  
Thruppence and sixpence every day  
Just to drive to my baby  
Thruppence and sixpence each day  
'Cause I drive my baby every way  
  
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus ...  
  
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)  
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)  
I drive my baby every way (Too much, Magic Bus)  
Each time I go a different way (Too much, Magic Bus)  
  
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it ...  
  
Every day you'll see the dust (Too much, Magic Bus)  
As I drive my baby in my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)

How dare you wear robes and reside  
How dare you cover your head to hide  
Your face from God  
  
How dare you smile from behind your beard  
To hide the fact that your hearts are feared  
And wave your rod  
  
How dare you be the one to assess  
Me in this godforsaken mess  
You, a man in a purple dress  
A man in a purple dress  
  
When you place your frown  
Between my God and prayer  
However grand your crown  
Or dignified your hair  
Men above men all prats  
In your high hats  
  
You priest, you mullah so high  
You pope, you wise rabbi  
You're invisible to me  
Like vapor from the sea  
  
I lovingly mock you noble lords  
We all dress up to grand awards  
I do that as well  
  
I dare condemn your fashion sense  
At least you're not astride the fence  
That wouldn't sell  
  
But I will deliver this address  
Your souls conditioned don't impress  
You, a man in a purple dress  
A man in a purple dress

She wants a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
He buys her things she calls him honey  
She calls me poor boy  
What good could it do  
To give a love pure and true  
When any fool could understand  
She thinks that money makes the man  
She wants a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
She wants the things she'll buy with money  
Not a poor boy  
A man with money, man with money, man with money  
Just down the street  
I know a place  
When there asleep  
I'll cover my face  
I'll break the lock, open the door  
I'll slip inside, I'll rob the store  
Then I'll be a man with lots of money  
Not a poor boy  
I'll buy her things, she'll call me honey  
Not a poor boy  
A man with money, man with money, man with money, man with money  

We're not strong enough!  
We're not young enough!  
We're not long enough,  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally we're not even old enough!  
  
Late at night, we're in a video-game dream,  
There is no lover in this numbered scene  
We summon every childhood ghost we've seen,  
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post Theme,  
  
(Chorus)  
Everything is alright (ba-do-ba)  
We pray today (ba-ba-ba-do-ba)  
Everything is OK (ba-do-ba)  
We play today  
  
Late at night, on the underground train,  
Through endless suburbs in endless pain,  
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain,  
Suddenly we hear Mike Post Again,  
  
(Chorus)  
  
We watch those films,  
That make men cry,  
Young lovers kiss,  
Then fight, and die,  
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,  
We have to face the truth sometime.  
  
We're not strong enough!  
We're not young enough!  
We're not long enough,  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally we're not even old enough!  
  
Well late at night we found our racing team,  
We're faced with women and reality games,  
We feel alive,  
We feel new and blind,  
We're hearing Mike Post in the air this time  
  
(Chorus)  
  
We watch those films,  
That make men cry,  
Young lovers kiss,  
Then fight, and die,  
We start to yearn, we climb the vine,  
We have to face the truth sometime

My life's  
In jeopardy  
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be  
I haven't been home since Friday night and now my wife  
Is comin' after me  
  
Give me police protection  
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one  
Give me a bodyguard  
A black belt judo expert  
With a machine gun!  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!  
When she catches up with me,  
Won't be no time to explain  
She thinks I've been with another woman  
And that's enough  
To send her half-insane!  
  
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive  
I may end up spendin' all my money,  
But I'll still be alive!  
  
All I did was have a bit too much to drink  
And I picked the wrong precinct  
Got picked up by the law and now I ain't got time to think  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!  
When she catches up with me,  
Won't be no time to explain  
She thinks I've been with another woman  
And that's enough  
To send her half-insane!  
  
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive  
I may end up spendin' all my money,  
But I'll still be alive!  
  
And I'm oh, so tired of running  
Gonna lay down on the floor  
I gotta rest some time  
So I can get to run some more  
Yeah!  
  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!

I've got a spade and a pick-axe  
And a hundred miles square of land to churn about  
My old horse is weary but sincerely  
I believe that he can pull a plough  
Well I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble,  
To grow my own food  
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds  
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through  
  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn  
That stretched as far as the eye can see  
That's a whole lot of cornflakes,  
Near enough to feed New York till 1973  
Cultivation is my station and the nation  
Buys my corn from me immediately  
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks  
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea  
  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
Now look here son  
The right thing to say  
Isn't necessarily what you want to say  
The right thing to do  
Isn't necessarily what you want to do  
The right things to grow  
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow  
Your own happiness  
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know  
  
Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse  
And my hands are deeply grained  
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing  
Just how lazily he took the strain  
Well my pick and spade are rusty,  
Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare  
  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
When you grow what I grow  
Tomatoes, potatoes, stew, eggplants...  
Potatoes, tomatoes...gourds

She sang the best she'd ever sang  
She couldn't ever sing any better  
But Mister Davidson never rang  
She knew he would forget her  
  
She'd seen him there  
And put herself to ransom  
He had stared  
He really was quite handsome  
  
She had really looked her best  
She couldn't ever look any better  
But she knew she'd failed the test  
She knew he would forget her  
  
Triumphant was the way she felt  
As she acknowledged the applause  
Triumphant was the way she'd felt  
When she saw him at the dressing room door  
  
She was happier than she'd ever been  
As he praised her for her grace  
But his expression changed, she had seen  
As he leant to kiss her face  
  
It ended there  
He claimed a late appointment  
She quickly turned  
To hide her disappointment  
  
She ripped her glittering gown  
Couldn't face another show, no  
Her deodorant had let her down  
She should have used Odorono

One at a time  
One at a time  
Always ready to fight over the little things  
Always ready to fight over the little things  
One at a time, she's  
One at a time, she's  
Always ready to fight over the little things.  
Always ready to fight over the little things.  
She's going crazy and the table starts shaking,  
She's going crazy and the table starts shaking,  
She's been abusing her body again

Her vision gets hazy and the bottles start breaking

She's been seeing that man again.  
She's been seeing that man again.

I found out she's continually cheating

She insists, she so innocent.

So I stayed out at another late meeting  
So I stayed out at another late meeting  
And she waited up for another argument.  
And she waited up for another argument.

I'm moving on to something better,

There must be something better than this,

She's got me so confused  
She's got me so confused  
As to who's being used

Call her up right away

You've got her number

And I promise not to pick up the phone

You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber

I just hope it can get you home

There's a scene  
There's a scene  
Indelible, it hangs before my eyes  
Indelible, it hangs before my eyes  
In our teens, incredibly  
In our teens, incredibly  
Together with no ties  
Together with no ties  
  
That was a life enough for me  
That was a life enough for me  
One life's enough for me  
One life's enough for me  
  
Throw back your head  
Throw back your head  
Let your body curve  
Let your body curve  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Pull me down into your hair  
Pull me down into your hair  
  
And I'll push and swerve  
And I'll push and swerve  
As we both gasp in the evening air  
As we both gasp in the evening air  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Throw back your head  
Throw back your head  
Let your body curve  
Let your body curve  
Into the long grass of the bed

Pull me down into your hair

And I'll push and swerve  
And I'll push and swerve  
As we both gasp in the evening air

Our love was...  
Our love was famine, frustration  
We only acted out an imitation  
Of what real love should have been  
Then suddenly...  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning  
  
Flying, soaring  
Shining morning  
Never leaving  
Lying, dying  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning  
  
Our love was famine, frustration  
We only acted out an imitation  
Of what real love should have been  
And then suddenly...  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning

Out!  
  
Out in the street  
I'm talkin' 'bout slowly  
I'm not gonna rest  
Woman, you don't know me  
  
Yeah, you don't know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Hey listen, woman  
You just can't throw me  
I won't stand it  
If you don't know me  
  
If you don't know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Listen to me  
I'm telling you  
You look at me, woman  
Yeah, tell the truth  
  
I know your mind  
I can see that you're in need  
I'll show you woman  
Yeah, that you belong to me  
  
You're gonna know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Give me no reasons  
Said you'd go free  
It's not gonna be now  
If you gotta know me  
  
You're gonna know me now  
Know me now  
Know me now  
Yeah, you're gonna know me

Now I'm in the ether  
Look down at time  
I see three children  
Prepare to walk the line  
  
I see them older  
When life is done  
I was a loser  
At the game they won  
  
Come on let's try  
To pick up the peace  
You and I  
On our hands and knees  
Come on let's try  
To touch the Fleece  
Come on let's try  
To pick up the peace  
  
(How do old people forget  
That the wars we've seen  
Are 'bout me longing for you  
You longing for me?)

Ever since I was a young boy,  
I've played the silver ball.  
From Soho down to Brighton  
I must have played them all.  
But I ain't seen nothing like him  
In any amusement hall  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!  
  
He stands like a statue,  
Becomes part of the machine.  
Feeling all the bumpers  
Always playing clean.  
He plays by intuition,  
The digit counters fall.  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!  
  
He's a pin ball wizard  
There has got to be a twist.  
A pin ball wizard,  
S'got such a supple wrist.  
  
How do you think he does it? I don't know!  
What makes him so good?'  
  
He ain't got no distractions  
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,  
Don't see lights a flashin'  
Plays by sense of smell.  
Always has a replay,  
'N' never tilts at all  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball.  
  
I thought I was  
The Bally table king.  
But I just handed  
My pin ball crown to him.  
  
Even on my favorite table  
He can beat my best.  
His disciples lead him in  
And he just does the rest.  
He's got crazy flipper fingers  
Never seen him fall  
That deaf dumb and blind kind  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!

Please, please, please, please me (You don't have to go)  
Baby please, baby please, please me (You don't have to go)  
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)  
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby  
I love you so (You don't have to go)  
  
Baby, you know you broke my heart when you went away (You don't have to go)  
I said, I said, I said I'll see you some other day (You don't have to go)  
I said, baby, baby, please, don't go (You don't have to go)  
Don't go, no baby, no baby  
I love you so (You don't have to go)  
  
Take this pain from my heart  
  
Baby, let me take you by the hand (You don't have to go)  
Baby, baby let me, let me be your lover man (You don't have to go)  
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)  
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby  
I love you so (You don't have to go)  
  
Please, please, please, please me (You don't have to go)  
Baby please, baby please, please me (You don't have to go)  
Baby please, baby please don't go (You don't have to go)  
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby  
I love you so (You don't have to go)  
  
Please please me

[Chorus:]  
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here  
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here  
There's miles of frankfurters and people who hurt us in Germany  
We haven't played since yesterday  
There's just ten more shows and one week to go  
We'd all like to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Great piles of spaghetti, bad vibes like confetti in Italy  
We go by train and not by plane  
We'd come home by car if it wasn't too far  
To drive home by car  
Hope you're well at home,  
Next week I'll try to phone,  
Not very long to go,  
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's lots of French fries, disapproving eyes in the U.S.A.  
We've had no shows since I don't know  
There's just one thing wrong, we've been here too long  
The money's all gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia  
Thrown off the plane for drinking beer  
So long on the plane it drove us insane  
So long on the plane  
Hope you're well at home,  
Next week I'll try to phone  
Not very long to go  
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've done very well, but we've been to hell and heaven as well

There once was a note, pure and easy,  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.  
The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,  
Forever we blend it, forever we die.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
As people assemble,  
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die,  
But killing is really merely scene changer,  
All men are bored with other men's lies.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup,  
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,  
Distortion becomes somehow pure in it's wildness,  
The note that began all can also destroy.  
  
We all know success when we all find our own dreams,  
And our love is enough to knock down any walls,  
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,  
The simple secret of the note in us all.  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word,  
And words when you played your guitar,  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,  
And a child flew past me riding in a star.  
  
There once was a note, pure and easy,  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.  
  
There once was a note, listen (x 18)

The Red Chins in their millions  
Will over spill their borders  
And chaos then will reign in our Rael  
  
Rael, the home of my religion  
To me the center of the Earth  
  
The Red Chins in their millions  
Will over spill their borders  
And chaos then will reign in our Rael  
  
My heritage is threatened  
My roots are torn and cornered  
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail  
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail  
  
Now Captain, listen to my instructions  
Return to this spot on Christmas Day  
Look toward the shore for my signal  
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay  
  
If a yellow flag is fluttering  
Sickly herald against the morn  
Then you'll know my courage has ended  
And you'll send your boat ashore  
  
But if a red flag is flying  
Brazen bold against the blue  
Then you'll know that I am staying  
And my yacht belongs to you  
  
Now Captain, listen to my instructions  
Return to this spot on Christmas Day  
Look toward the shore for my signal  
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay  
  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy, anyway  
  
If a yellow flag is fluttering  
Sickly herald against the morn  
Then you'll know my courage has ended  
And you'll send your boat ashore

When I think back to the  
first time in my childhood  
When I saw that face  
I thought right then,  
'That's a real good looking boy'  
  
I saw myself in the mirror  
in profile  
for the first time  
I thought,  
'Hey! That's a real good looking boy'  
  
And I felt then  
that I moved  
With all those lucky bucks and angels  
High in the theatre  
In the sky  
  
So I ran to my mother  
I said,  
'Mom take a look at me  
Have you ever seen a teen  
Fly so high?'  
  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
  
She said,  
'Son, well, you know,  
you're an ugly boy.  
You don't really look like him  
  
In this long line  
There's been some  
real strange genes  
You've got 'em all  
You've got 'em all  
With some extras thrown in'  
  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
  
Wise men say  
Only fools, only fools rush in  
But I, I can't help  
Falling in love, in love with you  
  
Now I'm here with you little darling  
And you say, 'You're beautiful as you are'  
And I've managed somehow to survive  
  
You arrived in my life like a fragrance  
You helped me find a way to laugh  
Now I know where my so-called beauty lies  
  
God gave him a face  
Then he gave me something above  
God gave me a grace  
Then he gave me your sweet, sweet, sweet love  
  
You make me feel like I'm a real good looking boy  
I feel I'm a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy

Relax and settle down  
Let your mind go 'round  
Lay down on the ground  
And listen to the sound  
Of the band  
Hold my hand  
  
Open up your mind  
We'll love right where we lie  
I'll know you from inside  
You're like a horse I'll ride  
O'er the sand  
Through the land  
  
Relax and let your mind roll on  
Over all your problems  
Relax and let your mind roll on  
Over all your problems  
  
We try harder and harder, tryin' to get our way  
But it's a long, long wait until Judgment Day  
So settle your affairs and take your time  
'Cause everything in the world is yours and mine  
Yours and mine  
  
Relax and settle down  
Let your mind go 'round  
Lay down on the ground  
And listen to the sound  
Of the band  
Hold my hand  
  
Relax!

Tough boys  
Running the streets  
Come a little closer  
Rough toys  
Under the sheets  
Nobody knows here  
Rough boys

Make noise  
Try and talk me away  
We can't be seen together  
Tough kids  
What can I do?  
I'm so pale and weedy  
Rough fits  
In my Hush Puppy shoes  
But I'm still pleadin  
Tough boys  
Running the streets  
Come a little closer  
Rough toys

Nobody knows her  
Rough boys  
Come over here

Run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
  
Well baby, better take my advice  
A black cat crossed your path twice  
The moon came out next to the 1  
Then you opened your umbrella in a room  
  
[Chorus:]  
You better run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
Run, run, run  
  
Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know  
And you won't get luckier the way you're going  
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked  
You walk under ladders then you walk right back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you dropped that little pin  
Never thought what a mess it'd get you in  
Little pin, little pin, bring me luck  
Because I stopped to pick you up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now, little girl, I'm helping you  
I hope you believe what I say is true  
Whenever you run, I'll be running too  
Whenever you run, I'll be following you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run, run, run

Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced  
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting  
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce  
And she ran inside weeping  
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture  
Of the new Messiah  
She picked up the book of her father's life  
And threw it on the fire  
  
[Chorus]  
She knew from the start  
Deep down in her heart  
That she and Tommy were worlds apart  
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part  
Is to be what you'll be."  
  
The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,  
Love will find a way',  
So Sally decided to ignore her dad  
And sneak out anyway  
She spent all afternoon getting ready  
And decided she'd try to touch him  
Maybe he'd see that she was free  
And talk to her this Sunday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She arrived at six, and the place was swinging  
To gospel music by nine  
Group after group appeared on the stage  
And Sally just sat there crying  
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture  
Right in the very front row  
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge  
Ran on and said, "Here we go!"  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy hit the stage  
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed  
The crowd back in a rage  
  
But soon the atmosphere was cooler  
As Tommy gave a lesson  
Sally just had to let him know she loved him  
And leapt up on the rostrum  
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure  
And touched him on the face  
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man  
Threw her off the stage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down  
Mingling with her tears  
Tommy carried on preaching  
And his voice filled Sally's ears  
She caught his eye, she had to try  
But couldn't see through their lights  
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men  
Had to carry her out that night  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy left the stage  
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch  
And a gash across her face, oh  
  
Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said  
"Don't say I didn't warn you."  
Sally got married to a rock musician  
She met in California  
Tommy always talks about the day  
The disciples all went wild  
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek  
To remind her of his smile  
  
[Chorus]

It's getting late have you seen my mates,  
It's getting late have you seen my mates,  
Go on and tell me when the boys get here.  
Go on and tell me when the boys get here.  
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,  
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,  
Want to get a belly full of beer.  
Want to get a belly full of beer.  
  
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys  
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys  
And my old lady she don't care  
And my old lady she don't care  
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of grease in her
hair.  
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of grease in her

Here by the sea and sand  
Nothing ever goes as planned,  
I just couldn't face going home  
It was just a drag on my own.  
They finally threw me out  
My mother got drunk on stout,  
My dad couldn't stand on two feet,  
As he lectured about morality.  
Now I guess the families complete,  
With me hanging round on the street  
Or here on the beach.  
  
The girl I love  
Is a perfect dresser,  
Wears every fashion  
Gets it to the tee.  
Heavens above,  
I got to match her  
She knows just how  
She wants her man to be  
Leave it to me.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat  
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
I see her dancing  
Across the ballroom  
UV light making starshine  
Of her smile.  
I am the face,  
She has to know me,  
I'm dressed up better than anyone  
Within a mile.  
  
So how come the other tickets look much better?  
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.  
How come the girls come on oh so cool  
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?  
  
Come sleep on the beach  
Keep within my reach  
I just want to die with you near  
I'm feeling so high with you here.  
I'm wet and I'm cold  
But thank God I ain't old  
I should have split home at fifteen  
Why didn't I ever say what I mean?  
There's a story that the grass is so green,  
What did I see?  
Where have I been?  
  
Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand

See Me

Tommy:  
  
I overwhelm as I approach you  
Make your lungs hold breath inside!  
Lovers break caresses for me  
Love enhanced when I've gone by.  
  
You'll feel me coming,  
A new vibration  
From afar you'll see me  
I'm a sensation.  
  
They worship me and all I touch  
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,  
Pleasant shudders shake their senses  
My warm momentum throws their stance.  
  
You'll feel me coming  
A new vibration  
From afar you'll see me  
I'm a sensation.  
  
I leave a trail of rooted people  
Mesmerized by just the sight,  
The few I touch are now disciples  
Love as one I am the light...  
  
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me  
I'm coming...  
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer  
I'm coming...  
I'm a sensation.

Once upon a time there lived an old miser man  
By the name of Silas Stingy  
He carried all his money in a little black box  
Which was heavy as a rock  
With a big padlock  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus:]  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
  
Silas didn't eat, which was just as well  
He would starve himself for a penny  
He wore old clothes and he never washed  
'Cause soap cost a lot  
And the dirt kept him hot  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus]  
In the back of his head  
Was a voice that said  
"Someone will steal it all  
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box  
The thieves will be having a ball"  
  
[Chorus]  
He bought a safe to put the box in  
And a house to put the safe in  
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure  
And his face was very funny  
When he counted up his money  
And he realized he hadn't any more  
  
[Chorus]

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ...  
  
I've got my clipboard, text books  
Lead me to the station  
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war  
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots  
I'm runnin' in the rain  
Gonna run till my feet are raw  
  
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation  
And I'm a soldier at thirteen  
Slip kid, slip kid, realization  
There's no easy way to be free  
No easy way to be free  
  
It's a hard, hard world  
  
I left my doctor's prescription bungalow behind me  
I left the door ajar  
I left my vacuum flask  
Full of hot tea and sugar  
Left the keys right in my car  
  
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation  
Only half way up the tree  
Slip kid, slip kid, I'm a relation  
I'm a soldier at sixty-three  
No easy way to be free  
  
Slip kid, slip kid  
  
Keep away old man, you won't fool me  
You and your history won't rule me  
You might have been a fighter, but admit you failed  
I'm not affected by your blackmail  
You won't blackmail me  
  
I've got my clipboard, text books  
Lead me to the station  
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war  
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots  
I'm runnin' in the rain  
Gonna run till my feet are raw  
  
Slip kid, slip kid, slip out of trouble  
Slip over here and set me free  
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation  
You're slidin' down the hill like me  
No easy way to be free  
No easy way to be free  
No easy way to be free

Mother:  
  
You don't answer my call  
With even a nod or a wink  
But you gaze at your own reflection!  
You don't seem to see me  
But I think you can see yourself.  
How can the mirror affect you?  
  
Can you hear me  
Or do I surmise?  
That you fear me can you feel my temper  
Rise.  
  
Do you hear or fear or  
Do I smash the mirror.  
Do you hear of fear or  
Do I smash the mirror? Smash!

So sad about us  
So sad about us  
Sad that the news is out now  
Sad, suppose we can't turn back now  
Sad about us  
  
So bad about us  
So bad about us  
Bad, never meant to break up  
Bad, suppose we'll never make up  
Bad about us  
  
Apologies mean nothing  
When the damage is done  
But I can't switch off my loving  
Like you can't switch off the sun

Goodnight baby,  
Someone's a-comin', someone's a-comin',  
Goodnight baby,  
Gotta get a-runnin', gotta get a-runnin'.  
  
Your father doesn't like me,  
Told you that you couldn't see me any more,  
That's why we meet in secret,  
That's why we're hiding here.  
  
Goodnight baby,  
Same time tomorrow, same time tomorrow,  
Goodnight baby,  
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow.  
  
Your mother made you stay in,  
When she saw you going out with me,  
You'll say you'll take the dog out,  
Then you sneak out here to me.  
  
If your parents find you here,  
You're gonna get a hiding, gonna get a hiding,  
So I'll vanish, disappear,  
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow.

I'm young in my camper van  
The world feels old and new  
I fear the future man  
As I take in the view  
Don't know where to head now  
Give up? Go back?  
My friends are all dead now  
Or stifled in the sack  
  
Sound round,  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found  
  
Breathe in  
Feel the spin  
Where's the dream  
That we were in?  
  
Sound round,  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found

Mama's got a squeeze box  
She wears on her chest  
And when Daddy comes home  
  
He never gets no rest  
'Cause she's playing all night  
And the music's all right  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
  
Well the kids don't eat  
And the dog can't sleep  
There's no escape from the music  
In the whole damn street  
'Cause she's playing all night  
And the music's all right  
  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes in and out and in  
And out and in and out and in and out  
She's playing all night  
  
And the music's all tight  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me  
Come on and tease me like you do  
I'm so in love with you  
  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes in and out and in and out  
And in and out and in and out  
'Cause she's playing all night  
  
And the music's all right  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night

Well, I'm gonna raise a fuss  
I'm gonna raise a holler  
'Bout workin' all summer  
Just to try to earn a dollar  
Well, I went to the boss man  
Tried to get a break  
But the boss said 'No dice, son,  
You gotta work late'  
  
Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do  
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Well, my Mom and Poppa told me  
Son, you gotta earn some money  
If you want to use the care  
To go riding next Sunday  
Well, I wouldn't go to work  
I told the boss I was sick  
He said 'You can't use the car  
'Cause you didn't work a lick'  
  
Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do  
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Gonna take two weeks  
Gonna have a fine vacation  
Gonna take my problem  
To the United Nations  
Well' I went to my congressman  
He said 'quote'  
'I'd like to help you son,  
But you're too young to vote'  
  
Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do  
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again I'll turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Once more you'll disappear  
My morning put to shame  
  
You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again I'll turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Once more you'll disappear  
My morning put to shame  
  
Sometimes I fear that this will go on my life through  
Each day I spend in an echoed vision of you  
And then again I'll turn down love  
Remembering your smile  
My every day is spent  
Thinking of you all the while  
  
The times I've let myself down  
My head's spinning 'round  
My eyes see only you  
The chances I've lost  
Opportunities tossed  
Away and into the blue  
  
You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again I'll turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Then again you'll disappear  
My morning put to shame

To break your little heart.

I am a man who looks after the pigs  
Usually I get along okay.  
I am man who reveals all he digs,  
Should be more careful what I say.  
  
I'm getting put down,  
I'm getting pushed round,  
I'm being beaten every day.  
My life's fading,  
But things are changing,  
I'm not gonna sit and weep again.  
  
I am man who drives a local bus  
I take miners to work, but the pits all closed today.  
It's easy to see that you are one of us.  
Ain't it funny how we all seem to look the same?  
  
We're getting put down  
My karma tells me  
You've been screwed again.  
If you let them do it to you  
You've got yourself to blame.  
It's you who feels the pain  
It's you that feels ashamed.  
  
I am a young man  
I ain't done very much,  
You men should remember how you used to fight.  
Just like a child, I've been seeing only dreams,  
I'm all mixed up but I know what's right.  
  
I'm getting put down

I know when I've had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
[Chorus:]  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone out of our love  
I know it's wrong  
We should enjoy it, but  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
  
Once we used to get along  
Now, each time we kiss, it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it ain't no fun  
And the good's gone now  
We used to love as one  
But we have forgotten now  
  
I know when I've had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gone forever

You declared you would be three inches taller  
You only became what we made you.  
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling  
You only earned what we gave you.  
You fell and cried as our people were starving,  
Now you know that we blame you.  
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving,  
Now you know that we framed you.  
  
[G.F.:]  
I'm the guy in the sky  
Flying high Flashing eyes  
No surprise I told lies  
I'm the punk in the gutter  
I'm the new president  
But I grew and I bent  
Don't you know? don't it show?  
I'm the punk with the stutter.  
My my my my my mmmm my my my.  
  
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation.  
  
[PUNK:]  
We tried to speak between lines of oration  
You could only repeat what we told you.  
Your axe belongs to a dying nation,  
They don't know that we own you.  
You're watching movies trying to find the feelers,  
You only see what we show you.  
We're the slaves of the phony leaders  
Breathe the air we have blown you.  
  
[G.F.:]  
I'm the guy [etc.]  
  
I have to be careful not to preach  
I can't pretend that I can teach,  
And yet I've lived your future out  
By pounding stages like a clown.  
And on the dance floor broken glass,  
The bloody faces slowly pass,  
The numbered seats in empty rows,  
It all belongs to me you know.  
  
[PUNK:]  
You declared [etc.]

Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Can ya?  
  
I went back to the doctor  
To get another shrink  
I sit and tell him bout my weekend  
But he never betrays what he thinks  
  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
Doctor?  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
Woah, Doctor!  
  
I went back to my mother  
I said "I'm crazy ma, help me"  
She said "I know how it feels son  
Cause it runs in the family"  
  
Can you see the real me, Mama?  
Mama?  
Can you see the real me, Mama?  
Woah, Mama!  
  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Can you see the real me?  
Can you see  
Can you see the real me  
The real me  
The real me  
  
The cracks between the paving stones  
Look like rivers of flowing veins  
Strange people who know me  
Peeping from behind every window pane  
The girl I used to love  
Lives in this yellow house  
Yesterday she passed me by  
She doesn't want to know me now  
  
Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Can ya?  
Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Woah, yeah!  
  
I ended up with a preacher  
Full of lies and hate  
I seemed to scare him a little  
So he showed me to the golden gate  
  
Can you see the real me, preacher?  
Preacher?  
Can you see the real me, preacher?  
Preacher?  
  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Woah  
  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
  
Can you see the real me, Ma?  
  
Can you see the real me?

I've looked under chairs  
I've looked under tables  
I've tried to find the key  
To fifty million fables  
  
[Chorus]  
They call me The Seeker  
I've been searching low and high  
I won't get to get what I'm after  
Till the day I die  
  
I asked Bobby Dylan  
I asked The Beatles  
I asked Timothy Leary  
But he couldn't help me either  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People tend to hate me  
Cause I never smile  
As I ransack their homes  
They want to shake my hand  
  
Focusing on nowhere  
Investigating miles  
I'm a seeker  
I'm a really desperate man  
  
I won't get to get what I'm after  
Till the day I die  
  
I learned how to raise my voice in anger  
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?  
I'm happy when life's good  
And when it's bad I cry  
I've got values but I don't know how or why  
  
I'm looking for me  
You're looking for you  
We're looking in at other  
And we don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus]

The song is over  
It's all behind me  
I should have known it  
She tried to find me  
  
Our love is over  
They're all ahead now  
I've got to learn it  
I'm gonna to sing out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
When I walked in through the door  
Thought it was me I was looking for  
She was the first song I ever sang  
But it stopped as soon as it began  
  
Our love is over  
It's all behind me  
They're all ahead now  
Can't hope to find me  
  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
This song is over  
I'm left with only tears  
I must remember  
Even if it takes a million years  
  
The song is over  
The song is over  
  
Searchin' for a note, pure and easy  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by

Where do you walk on sunny times  
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine  
How do you feel when the pollen falls  
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls  
  
And they're all in love  
And they're all in love  
  
Where do you fit in zip magazine  
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen  
Just tell me right now where do you fit in  
With mud in your eye and a passion for gin  
  
And they're all in love  
And they're all in love  
  
Hey, goodbye all you punks  
Stay young and stay high  
Hand me my checkbook  
And I'll crawl out to die  
  
But like a woman in childbirth  
Grown ugly in a flash  
I'm seen magic and fame  
Now I'm recycling trash  
  
And they're all in love  
And they're all in love  
And they're all in love  
And they're all in love

I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar  
The glass sets up a sound like people laughing  
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain  
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing  
Mmm.  
I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me  
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish  
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around  
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing  
Find it, I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it, as my tears fall again  
It's only by the music I'll be free  
There's something in the whisper of the trees  
Millions hear it, still they can't believe  
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves  
As an empire of dead men leave their graves  
Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls  
Don't listen to me or words from men above  
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds  
Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing  
Find it, I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it, as my tears fall again  
It's only by the music I'll be free

Ever since I was a young boy,  
I've played the silver ball.  
From Soho down to Brighton  
I must have played them all.  
But I ain't seen nothing like him  
In any amusement hall  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball !  
  
He stands like a statue,  
Becomes part of the machine.  
Feeling all the bumpers  
Always playing clean.  
He plays by intuition,  
The digit counters fall.  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball !  
  
He's a pin ball wizard  
There has got to be a twist.  
A pin ball wizard,  
S'got such a supple wrist.  
  
'How do you think he does it? I don't know!  
What makes him so good?'  
  
He ain't got no distractions  
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,  
Don't see lights a flashin'  
Plays by sense of smell.  
Always has a replay,  
'N' never tilts at all  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball.  
  
I thought I was  
The Bally table king.  
But I just handed  
My pin ball crown to him.  
  
Even on my favorite table  
He can beat my best.  
His disciples lead him in  
And he just does the rest.  
He's got crazy flipper fingers  
Never seen him fall  
That deaf dumb and blind kind  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!!!

I think these hands have felt a lot,  
I don't know, what have I touched,  
I think these eyes have seen a lot,  
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much.  
  
I think this brain has thought a lot,  
Searching, trying to find the crutch,  
I think this heart has bled once too often,  
This time it's bled a bit too much.  
  
Too much of anything, too much for me,  
Too much of everything gets too much for me.  
  
I can't remember before '49,  
But I know that '48 was there,  
My ears let in what I should speak out,  
Hmmm, there's something in the air.  
  
Ooh, I've overloaded on my way,  
Bye, bye, bye, bye, you better keep in touch.  
Think your ears hear a whole lot of music,  
And like me they've caught a bit too much.  
  
Too much of anything, is too much for me,  
Too much of everything gets too much for me.  
  
I think these hands have felt a lot,  
I don't know, what have I touched,  
I think these eyes have seen a lot,  
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much.  
  
I think this brain has thought a lot,  
Oh, searching, trying to find the crutch,  
I think these ears hear a whole lot of music,  
And like me they've heard a bit too much.  
  
Too much of anything, is too much for me,  
Too much of everything gets too much for me.

Wide awake in the middle of the night  
I wonder how she's feelin'  
Is it just a trick of the light  
Or is her ceiling peeling?  
  
She's sitting up in bed, shakin' her head  
At a copy of "true confessions"  
Ooh, it must seem like a fairy tale  
To a woman of her profession  
  
[Chorus:]  
But was I all right? (was I all right?)  
Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?  
Was I all right? (was I all right?)  
Did a shadow of emotion cross your face  
Or was it just another trick of the light?  
[Repeat]  
  
Come on, tell me  
What's a nice girl like you doin' in a place like this?  
They don't make girls like you no more  
And I'd like to get to know you  
On closer terms than this  
But I guess you've heard it all before  
  
Lady of the night  
Won't you steal away with me?  
Lady of the night  
Won't you steal away with me?  
  
The money's lyin' on the floor, she looks at me  
Shakes her head and sighs  
Out of time, out the door  
Red light shinin' in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right?  
But was I all right?  
All right?

Your mother loves her brother  
But her brother loves his lover  
And his lover is my cover  
My one and only other - my angel  
  
My angel Trilby  
Who said I will be  
What I should still be  
Genius would fill me - she loves Hymie  
  
Only one Hymie  
No one else on earth could ever blind me - like this  
Or even find me - such bliss  
If you were gone  
You'd still be here  
  
Only one Hymie  
Why can't they see that life excites me  
This boy ignites me  
His family fights me  
But he's still here  
  
Only one Hymie...
