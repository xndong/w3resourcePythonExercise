Street is like a jungle, so call the police  
Following the herd down to Greece on holiday  
Love in the nineties is paranoid  
On sunny beaches take your chances, looking for  
  
Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys  
Always should be someone you really love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available  
Like battery thinkers count your thoughts  
On one, two, three, four, five fingers  
  
Nothing is wasted only reproduced  
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr schoen  
But we haven't been introduced  
  
Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys  
Always should be someone you really love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Looking for  
Girls, boys, boys, girls  
Boys, girls, girls, boys  
Always should be someone you really love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Somewhere out in the heart of Suburbia  
Flinching from the words  
That could almost murder her  
Listen, it's the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
She's wearin' plaid and jeans  
Like a workman on the road  
Hitchin' out west  
With a personal stereo  
Playin' "Lay, lady, lay"  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
In her heart she's not even a renegade  
From the start she knew  
Why she would not be saved  
All her instincts lead a different way  
In the pocket by her heart  
Is a dog-eared Polaroid  
A picture of a girl with her arm 'round a boy  
Who went missing the final day  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
(I don't care what they say)  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
(I don't care what they say)  
Girls don't cry  

Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Give it a go, why don't you choose me?  
Say it's not so that you rather lose me  
If you're disposed to say forget it  
You don't suppose you might regret it  
  
Give it a go, let's make our break now  
Don't look down your nose, or so I'll pick now  
For all we know, there's not much time left  
If you give me a no, you leave me be runt  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go, give it a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Taken away, shed all I've got now  
Catch the bouquet, let's tie the knots down  
A beautiful day you're smile has crowned  
If you're looking for love I think you found it  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,  
You could be aiming for a cool time, you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,  
You could be aiming for a cool time, you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go  
  
Give it a go, give it a go

It is not easy  
It is not easy  
  
Looking from a window  
At the back of a house  
At the edge of a town  
It's gray  
Like the day  
When I lost it  
Clouds overhead  
I talked to a flower  
That was almost dead  
My body a prison  
Why did I do it?  
Someone told me not to  
But still went through it  
  
[Chorus]  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
Needed somewhere to clear  
My head  
Find some strength  
A warmer bed  
Maximum love in a  
Minimal world  
I'd never achieved it  
But then I believed it  
So when I lost it, how?  
I'm not sure now,  
It was a strange feeling  
Like a paw repealing itself  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I can wake up in the morning  
And not believe what I see  
Look in the mirror  
And think if that's really me  
I don't think I suit my face  
It's not a catastrophe  
It's more a philosophy  
Like the Russians  
Wondering why  
We're born under a blue sky  
But die in a dark forest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
This is neither old nor new  
It's always, forever  
Somewhere between sense  
And ambition  
Pleasure and decision  
We have to make a choice  
What do we want?  
Everyone singing  
"War, what is it good for?"  
While planning the next one?  
  
I don't need to win  
You don't have to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
The war within us  
But it gets easier  
The more we learn  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option

We all have a dream  
of a place we belong  
The fire is burning  
and the radio's on  
Somebody smiles  
and it means 'I love you'  
but sometimes we don't notice  
when the dream has come true  
  
You've got a home here  
Call it what you want  
You've got a home here  
to return to when you can't  
face the world and you need  
some support to succeed  
You've got a home  
  
We all make a mess  
of our lives from time to time  
It's part of the process  
that you stumble as you climb  
And if you ever feel  
the pain is far too big a deal  
I say with pride  
I'll be on your side  
  
You've got a home here  
Call it what you want  
You've got a home here  
You're gonna want it when you can't  
face the world and you need  
some support to succeed  
You've got a home

Hey, Headmaster, what's the matter with you?  
Why're you always so serious, why so blue?  
All the kids in the school have seen you  
Being patient with the boys who fool you  
When you used to hit them with your ruler  
So independent too  
Hey, Headmaster, what's the matter with you?  
  
There's a crisis rumored in the school  
The boys have cut their hair short to look cool  
Examination time is drawing near  
Disintegration of the football team  
No one seems to want to play for real  
In classroom, club or pool  
Hey, Headmaster, what're you gonna do?  
  
There's an invitation in the post  
To a reading party on the coast  
Pack your bags up, you old bibliophile  
Get together with your friends, who will  
Give you time to think and time to kill  
With independent hosts  
Hey, Headmaster, aren't you gonna go?  
Hey, Headmaster, aren't you gonna go?

Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to the latest song  
Live a lie, dance together  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music  
Hit music  
  
I've been working hard all day  
To pay the bills I have to pay  
Don't have the strength to work all night  
Or fight until it's almost light  
  
Music on the radio  
The dance music at the disco  
  
Live a lie dance together  
All night long to your favourite song  
Live and die, it's all that we know  
I need a friend at the journey's end  
  
Hit music, in stereo  
  
It's all I've brought, but it's about forgetting  
Choose a song when the night's too long  
We all need love and we want protection  
I need a friend at the journey's end  
In Kensington, or Spanish Harlem  
All night long to your desperate  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Music at the disco  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  

You live upon a stage, and everyone's agreed  
You're the brightest hope by far that anyone can see  
So when you take the limelight you can guarantee  
You're gaining fame and claiming credibility  
  
Tell me baby are you gonna get high as a kite?  
Tell me baby are you gonna let it happen every night  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
  
You live within the law, and everyone assumes  
You must find this a bore, and try something new  
You're an intellectual giant, an authority  
To preach and teach the whole world about ecology  
  
Tell me baby are you gonna make any other claims?  
Tell me baby are you gonna take any of the blame?  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
  
You live within the headlines, so everyone can see  
You're supporting every new cause and meeting royalty  
You're another major artist on a higher plane  
Do you think they'll put you in the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame?  
  
Tell me baby how you generate longevity  
Tell me baby how you really hate publicity  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
  
Seriously  
Seriously  
  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?  
How can you expect to be taken seriously?

Someone states the obvious  
Someone sneers at all you love  
Someone preaches ugly manners  
excluding some, including me  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
All feelings blunted, all passion spent  
Everybody does what everybody does  
All the broken promises  
to recreate a status quo  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll

Feeling like I'm stuck in a hole  
Body and soul  
While you're out of control  
Now I know why you had to go  
Well I think we both know  
Why it had to be so  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you  
  
[Chorus]  
I get along, get along  
Without you very well  
I get along very well  
  
Now I know you'd much rather be  
With rock royalty  
Instead of someone like me  
The big boys are back and we need them, you said  
Think it was something you'd read  
And it stuck in your head  
Even though I don't suppose  
That's as far as it goes  
You've go quite an appetite  
For being wronged and in the right  
Well from now on it won't affect me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The morning after the night before  
I'd been alerted  
To your lies  
I phoned you up  
Your calls were all diverted  
Took a long time to track you down  
Even then you were defiant  
It's not what you think it is, you said  
And proceeded to deny it  
  
So I lost my patience at last  
And it happened so fast  
You belong in the past  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you  
  
[Chorus]

"I'm all alone again"  
  
I walked into the room  
Imagine my surprise  
You were sitting close to him  
Staring in each other's eyes  
  
Each of you looked up  
But no one said a word  
I felt I should apologise  
For what I hadn't heard  
  
A silence filled the room  
Awkward as an elephant  
In the crowded court of your love  
I was now a supplicant  
  
And clumsy as I felt  
At stumbling on this theft  
To save further embarrassment  
I made my excuses and left  
  
So long ago  
I felt like such a fool  
For crying  
All that I know  
Is when you feel inside  
You're dying  
It all begins again  
Defying  
Your excuses

I want a dog,  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
  
Don't want a cat,  
Scratching its claws all over my  
Habitat  
Giving no love and getting fat  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
And a cat's no help with that  
  
I want a dog,  
To walk in the park  
When it gets dark, my dog will bark  
At any passers-by  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
I want a dog  
  
I want a dog,  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
I want a dog  

At this time of night, when the crowds have passed  
We're the last to leave, we need some company  
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why  
You know the reason that we need this company  
I've been sitting here, looking out for you  
Someone just like me, who's maybe had a drink or two  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want another drink or fight  
I want a lover  
I don't care whether it's wrong or right  
I want a lover tonight  
Tonight  
  
Outside the dawn is breaking, looks like it's started raining  
We'll catch a cab, and soon be driving home  
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why  
You'll know the reason just as soon as we get home  
You've been sitting there, wondering what to do  
I've been standing here, waiting to make the first move  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
This anticipation is a stimulation  
No need for conversation as we're driving home  
Put your arms around me, it doesn't mean you love me  
Just that you want me and you need my company  
Driving through the night, it's so exciting  
Turning off the light without another thought tonight  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(I want you, I want your love) I want a lover  
(I want you, I want your love) I want a lover  
(I want you, I want your love) I want a lover (I want your love tonight)  
Oh

I heard what you said, and I can tell you it's true  
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you  
Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over  
Think of you and shall I ever recover?  
  
Now, I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
  
I stood at the kitchen-sink, my radio played  
Songs like "Tainted Love" and "Love Is Strange"  
As I listened and the words hit my ears  
I cried sudden tears  
  
Now, I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
Wake up  
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)  
  
(It's mad, it's mad, it's mad)  
It's mad, to be in love with someone else  
When you're in love with he, she's in love with me  
But you know as well as I do  
I can never think of anyone but you  
  
(All my life,  
All my life  
I want to wake up)  
  
Play with fire, play with guns  
It's easy to impress someone  
Turning in my sleep, you called me fool  
To fall in love, is it so uncool?  
  
Now, I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
Now, I want to wake up  
Wake up  
  
(Wake up, wake up  
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh  
  
I, I want to wake up  
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh I, I want to wake up, with  
you)  
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh -  
Oooh  

Ask me why,  
I say it's most unusual  
How can I even try to explain  
Why today I feel like dancing  
Singing like lovers sing  
When I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing?  
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  
  
Ask me when, (ta ra ra ra)  
I say it started when I met you (ta ra ra ra ra ra)  
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last  
For right now, I think I'm running  
A race that I know I'm gonna win  
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  
  
If people say I'm crazy, I tell 'em that it's true  
Let them watch with amazement  
Say it won't last beyond breakfast  
It's a phase he's going through  
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through  
Because it isn't the sort of thing I would normally do  
  
Ask me what, (ta ra ra ra)  
I say I think it's good for you (ta ra ra ra ra)  
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to  
I feel like taking all my clothes off  
Dancing to the right of Spring  
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldn't normally do this kind of -  
This kind of thing

What d'you want?  
You've got nothing to say  
And you can't  
Hide that look of dismay  
Why pretend?  
You only want revenge  
It's been said  
I'd be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
Where'd you go  
With that threadbare crowd  
Still in tow?  
Do they appreciate your  
Tales of woe?  
Droning on and on  
Lost your thread?  
I'd be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
You think you're acting  
In self-defense  
But you're fooling no one  
And you never will  
The only crime is irrelevance  
No wonder you're worried  
I'd be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
  
Welcome to a unique event  
Where we see what you represent  
Flaunt that look  
Of 'Let battle commence!'  
It changes nothing  
And it never will  
And on that matter of self-defense  
I'm not worried  
I'd be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
If looks could kill

I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
  
Hey ho if love were all  
I should be lonely  
  
I believe the more you love a man  
The more you give your trust  
The more you're bound to lose  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
Chaos would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse  
Hey ho if love were all  
Hey ho if love were all

In denial, no  
My life's a trial  
I'm not denying  
That every little bit hurts  
It's a problem  
That I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while, getting away  
Before it gets any worse today  
  
You're in denial  
And that is final  
You're not admitting  
You should be quitting  
All these  
Queens and fairies  
And muscle Marys  
The rough trade boyfriend  
Who in his pathetic own way  
Denies he's gay  
Why can't you see?  
This is a fantasy world  
  
Think I'm going mad  
How do you know if you're  
Going mad?  
  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Look at me I'm sad  
  
I'm not denying  
I could be trying  
A little harder  
To deal with some of this stuff  
  
Know what I'm thinking?  
Less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes and you'd feel  
A little less rough  
  
Is that enough?  
My life is absurd, I'm living it  
Upside down  
Like a vampire, working at  
Night, sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows  
He's gay  
  
Can you love me anyway?

Take your time and tell me  
Why you lie?  
I realise  
That we've been found out this time  
We should stand together  
If we can  
But what you planned  
Means there's a difference between ...  
What you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
So discrete (She's so discrete)  
I never tried to meet (She never)  
Your friends or interfere (No)  
I took a back seat (Back seat) between ...  
On what you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
What you gonna say  
When you run back to your wife  
I guess it's just the story of her life  
What you gonna say  
So take your time  
And tell me, when did you lie  
Oh, I mean  
All the time (No)  
That there's a difference (A difference) between (between)  
On what you're gonna say in private  
You still want my love, we're in this together  
And what you're gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
Tell me what you gonna say (In private) Oooh  
(You still want my love, we're in this together)  
What you gonna say, what you gonna do  
(And what you're gonna do) Baby  
(in public) What you gonna say  
(Say you were never in love) Oooh  
(that you can remember) What you gonna say  
Say in private

Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
There's a lot of people coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
  
That Zazou, he don't care  
Dark glasses, long hair  
Takes his time, sneers at men  
Some ugly people want revenge  
  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night (In the night)  
  
In the night (In the night)  
  
That Zazou, he sleeps all day  
Then down to Select or Le Collisee  
Sips his drinks, orders more  
Says what he thinks and it's a crazy war  
  
Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
A knock on the door in the night  
(In the night In the night ...)  
  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night (the night the night)  
  
And when the soldiers strut, all he cares about  
Is love  
When the flags are out, all he cares about  
Is love  
Well, there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and -  
Collaboration (-ration)  
  
In the night  
(In the night In the night In the night In the night ...)  
  
(Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime  
Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime Crime  
Crime Crime Crime Crime ...)  
  
In the night (In the night In the night)  
  
In the night (In the night In the night)  
  
Zazou, what you're gonna do?  
There's a lot of people coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
  
Now everybody's under somebody's spell  
Unless they've already gone to hell  
In the streets you can hear the people say  
That, Zazou, he should be locked away!  
  
When the soldiers strut, all he cares about  
Is love  
Oh, when the flags are out, all he cares about  
Is love  
And there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and collaboration  

Zazou, whatcha gonna do?  
There's a lot of people and they're coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
That Zazou, he don't care  
The dark glasses  
The long hair  
Takes his time  
Sneers at men  
Some ugly people want revenge  
Zazou comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
In the night  
That Zazou he sleeps all day  
Then down to Select or Le Collisee  
Sips his drinks, orders more  
Says what he thinks and it's a crazy war  
Zazou, whatcha gonna do?  
A knock on the door in the night  
Zazou comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out  
All he cares about is love  
Well there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and  
Collaboration  
In the night  
In the night  
In the night  
Zazou whatcha gonna do?  
There's a lot of people and they're coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
Now everybody's under somebody's spell  
Unless they've already gone to Hell  
In the streets you can hear the people say  
"That Zazou, he should be locked away!"  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out  
All he cares about is love  
Well there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and  
Collaboration

I was lost  
For so long  
Feels like it's taken  
Half my life  
To find  
Where I belong  
  
[Chorus]  
Seeing you here  
You're my nation  
This is my application  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
All the worlds  
That I saw  
I went so far away  
And still wanted you more  
  
It may sound superficial  
But can we make it official?  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
Tell me where I stand  
What do you envision?  
One way or another  
Give me your decision now  
  
Is it time  
To proceed?  
Will you give me a chance  
And the status I need?  
  
[Chorus]

If you've done nothing wrong  
You've got nothing to fear  
If you've something to hide  
You shouldn't even be here  
  
Long live us  
The persuaded we  
Integral  
Collectively  
To the whole project  
It's brand new  
Conceived solely  
To protect you  
  
One world  
One reason  
Unchanging  
One season  
  
If you've done nothing wrong  
You've got nothing to fear  
If you've something to hide  
You shouldn't even be here  
You've had your chance  
Now we've got the mandate  
If you've changed your mind  
I'm afraid it's too late  
  
We're concerned  
You're a threat  
You're not integral  
To the project  
  
Everyone has  
Their own number  
In the system that  
We operate under  
We're moving to  
A situation  
Where your lives exist as  
Information  
  
One world  
One life  
One chance  
One reason  
All under  
One sky  
Unchanging  
One season  
  
If you've done nothing wrong  
You've got nothing to fear  
If you've something to hide  
You shouldn't even be here  
You've had your chance  
Now we've got the mandate  
If you've changed your mind  
I'm afraid it's too late  
  
We're concerned  
You're a threat  
You're not integral  
To the project

I can't be cool or nonchalant  
Call me an impulsive fool  
You're all I want  
You may be right  
It's too much to soon  
To talk of love all night  
In your bedroom  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
I won't play games or waste your time  
But I won't feel ashamed to speak my mind  
So just relax  
Don't question why for calculated facts  
Will not apply  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
In my life there've been few  
Who've affected me the way you do  
(You do you do)  
I'll tell no lies I won't pretend  
But if you've a broken heart  
I'll help it mend  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
Smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  

Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed  
In six inch heels, quoting magazines  
Go all the way, you knew you could  
So far, so good  
  
Someone asked: Who do you think you are?  
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?  
Shrugged him off, and locked the door  
So good, this far  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here here  
  
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense  
Our dignity and injured innocence  
It contradicts your battle-scars  
Still healed, so far  
  
Now it almost seems incredible  
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, but I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've found ourselves back where we started from  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  
  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  

Are you feeling alright?  
It's easy, we've been there before  
But it feels like the flight  
Of the von Trapps, does that mean it's war?  
Oh no,  
From my head to my toes  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
We're meant to be friends  
That's what it says in the script  
Is it really the end  
If, sometimes, I stray just a bit?  
Oh no,  
It should be poetry, not prose  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
I never told you, now I suppose  
That you're the only one who doesn't know  
  
You were different when  
We met in an ordinary way  
I didn't intend  
To interrupt your own shadowplay  
Oh no,  
I won't upset the status quo  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
You've never asked me, and I'm surprised  
That you're the only one who hasn't tried  
  
Everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
I never asked you, now I suppose  
That you're the only one who doesn't know  
  
Aah  
When they look at us  
It must be obvious  
Oooh

(It's alright)  
(It's alright)  
I can hear it  
(Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright)  
(Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright)  
  
Dictation being forced in Afghanistan  
Revolution in South Africa taking a stand  
People in Eurasia on the brink of oppression  
I hope it's gonna be alright  
'Cause the music plays forever  
(For it goes on and on and on and on)  
Yeahah  
  
I hope it's gonna be alright

'Cause the music plays forever  
(For it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on)  
  
The year three thousand may still come to pass  
But the music shall last  
I can hear it on a timeless wavelength  
Never dissipating but giving us strength  
  
I hope it's gonna be alright  
(Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright)

Oh oh  
Lawrence in the desert, how was he to know  
Under so much pressure from the men back home?  
  
Play with fire, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
Play with guns, you must be bad  
Or hiding something, Jack!  
  
Telling lies in public, breaking codes at home  
Underneath the blankets, for another role  
  
Tell these lies, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
To feast with panthers every night  
You must be careful, Jack!  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let them try to restrain you  
This is your only religion  
Don't let them try to detain you  
You're not the only fool  
We all fall, even Jack the Lad  
We all fall, even Jack the Lad  
  
Will fall  
  
Philby in the desert  
looking for a phone  
Waiting on the pavement  
for a call from home  
  
Play with fire, you must be mad  
Are you only Jack the Lad?  
Turn your back on friends you had  
They must have hurt you, Jack!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Will fall

Small man, big world  
Lost beyond the pale  
I know you inside out  
I can tell the tale  
  
Across the sky the change of time  
Last night I lost all day  
I'm here and there or anywhere  
Away from Manderley  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldn't be more tragic  
My fate to roam so far from home  
In search of mindless magic  
  
Oh baby come back  
Oh baby come back to me  
  
The desert moon, a new lagoon  
We glide upon the surface  
Night falls fast, no shadows cast  
Arriving without purpose  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldn't be more lonely  
With so much scope to dream and hope  
Someday you'll deign to phone me  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
I long for your inscrutable pale face  
I hunger for your beautiful embrace

The man at the back of the queue was sent  
To feel the smack of firm government  
Linger by the flyposter, for a fight  
It's the same story every night  
I've been hurt and we've been had  
You leave home, and you don't go back  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
  
Only last night I found myself lost  
By the station called King's Cross  
Dead and wounded on either side  
You know it's only a matter of time  
I've been good and I've been bad  
I've been guilty of hanging around  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
  
So I went looking out today  
For the one who got away  
Murder walking round the block  
Ending up in King's Cross  
Good luck, bad luck waiting in a line  
It takes more than the matter of time  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
And there's still no guarantee  
There is still no guarantee  

I get out of bed at half past ten  
Phone up a friend, who's a party animal  
Turn on the news and drink some tea  
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping  
  
One day I'll read, or learn to drive a car  
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest  
But I don't like to compete, or talk street, street, street  
I can pick up the best from the party animal  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
  
Pick up a brochure about the sun  
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw  
I was always told that you should join a club  
Stick with the gang, if you want to belong  
  
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy  
In a world of my own at the back of the garden  
I didn't want to compete, or play out on the street  
For in a secret life I was a round head general  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
Oh, I would  
  
I was faced with a choice at a difficult age  
Would I write a book? Or should I take to the stage?  
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet  
Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat  
  
It's not a crime when you look the way you do  
The way I like to picture you  
When I get home, it's late at night  
I pour a drink and watch the fight  
  
Turn off the TV, look at a book  
Pick up the phone, fix some food  
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day  
Waiting for the minute I hear you say  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Come on, baby, say goodbye  
I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
  
Out of bed, at half past ten  
The party animal phones a friend  
Picks up news about the sun  
And the working day has just begun  
  
Sticks with the gang - at the back of the street  
Pass the test - and don't compete  
  
Drive the car, if you're with me  
Che Guevara's drinking tea  
He reads about a new device  
And takes to the stage in a secret life  
  
(Aaaaaaaah... ...ce)  
  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
If I was left to my own devices, I possibly would  
  
(Aaaaaaaah... ...ce)  
  
If I was left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
Come on, baby  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  

That's it, the end  
But you'll get over it, my friend  
  
Time will pass, governments fall  
Glaciers melt, hurricanes bawl  
High-speed trains take us away  
North or south and back the same day  
  
And you, you'll get over it  
You do, you get over it  
  
Seasons will change, more or less  
Species vanish, art perplex  
Resentment remain both east and west  
Police expect an arrest  
  
For now, you'll get over it  
Somehow, you'll get over it  
  
You'll be there, the king over the water  
In despair, recoiling from the slaughter  
  
They're raising an army in the North  
From York Minster to the Firth of Forth  
A pilgrimage of grace, you won't believe it  
Such a human face when you receive it  
  
And you will get over it  
With time to kill, you'll get over it  
  
There's a cruiser waiting at Scapa Flow  
To take you away from all you know  
The old man agonised  
He really has compromised  
  
Public opinion may not be on your side  
There are those who think they've been taken for a ride  
You'll get over it, I'm on your side because  
You'll get over it, and what a ride it was!  
  
Tout les artistes dans le monde  
Chantent pour toi ce soir  
Tout les artistes dans le monde  
Chantent pour toi c'est noir  
  
It's dark, but you'll get over it  
On your mark, you'll get over it  
  
That Carphone Warehouse boy has been on the phone  
He wants to upgrade the mobile you own  
Have you realized your computer's a spy?  
Give him a ring, he'll explain why  
  
The bourgeoisie will get over it  
Look at me, I'm so over it  
And you, you'll get over it!  
You do, you get over it in time

Take my hand,  
I've changed my mind again  
Really, I believed it true  
That all who fell in love were foolish  
But I was wrong,  
I've learned that lesson well  
All the way back home at midnight  
You were sleeping on my shoulder  
  
Take my hand,  
Don't think of obligations  
Now, right now,  
Your love is liberation  
  
To free in me  
The trust, I never dared  
I always thought the risk too great  
But suddenly, I don't hesitate, so  
  
Take my hand,  
Don't think of complications  
Now, right now,  
Your love is liberation  
Liberation  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
The night, the stars  
Our light shone through the dark  
All the way back home at midnight  
You were sleeping on my shoulder  
  
Take my hand,  
Don't think of hesitation  
Now, right now,  
Your love is liberation  
Liberation  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
Ta ra ra ra ra ra  
  
Back home at midnight  
All the way back home at midnight  

We came from the far North  
Summered in Crimea  
Deserted the armed forces  
Had to disappear  
Made it to the free West  
On a chartered flight  
So we could see what  
We trained to fight  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
  
Looking for hard work  
Or credit card fraud  
What do you expect from us?  
We come from abroad  
To get ourselves a new job  
On a building-site  
They work you so hard  
But we trained to fight  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
  
My father fought in Afghanistan  
His widows pension ain't worth a damn  
My mother works and goes home to cry  
I want to live before I die  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is

The sun comes up, I think about you  
The coffee cup, I think about you  
I want you so, it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
The morning ends, I think about you  
I talk to friends and think about you  
And do they know it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
All afternoon doing every little chore  
The thought of you stays bright  
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor  
Not going left, not going right  
  
I dim the lights and think about you  
Spend sleepless nights to think about you  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
All afternoon doing every little chore  
The thought of you stays bright  
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor  
Not going left, not going right  
  
I dim the lights and think about you  
Spend sleepless nights to think about you  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
Or am I losing  
Losing my mind  
  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
Were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
Losing my mind  
Losing my mind

Sooner or later, this happens to everyone  
To everyone  
  
You can live your life lonely  
Heavy as stone  
Live your life learning  
And working alone  
Say this is all you want  
But I don't believe that it's true  
'Cause when you least expect it  
Waiting round the corner for you  
  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
  
You can live a life of luxury  
If that's what you want  
Taste forbidden pleasures  
Whatever you want  
  
You can fly away to the end of the end of the world  
But where does it get you to?  
'Cause just when you least expect it  
Just what you least expect  
  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
  
I know it sounds ridiculous, but speaking from experience  
It may seem romantic, and that's no defense  
Love will always get to you  
  
Sooner or later, sooner or later, this happens to everyone  
To everyone  
  
You can fly away to the end of the end of the world  
But where does it get you?  
  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
(Oooh)  
  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  

(you need more, you need more, you need more,  
You need more,you need more,you need more,  
You need more,you need more,you need more)  
  
Boy it's tough getting on in the world  
When the sun doesn't shine and a boy needs a girl  
It's about getting out of a rut, you need luck  
And your stuck and don't know how (oh)  
  
(don't have to be) A big bucks Hollywood star  
(don't have to drive)A super car to get far  
(don't have to live)A life of power and wealth  
(don't have to be) beautiful but it helps  
(don't have to buy)A house in Beverly hills  
(don't have to have)your daddy paying the bills  
(don't have to live)A life of power and wealth  
(don't have to be) beautiful but it helps  
  
You need more than a big blank check to be a lover,or  
A gulf stream jet to fly you door to door  
Somewhere chic on another shore  
You need more you need more you need more you need more you need more you need
more  
You need love you need love you need love  
Too much of anything is never enough  
Too much of everything is never enough  
  
Boy it's tough getting on in the world  
When the sun doesn't shine and a boy needs a girl  
It's about getting out of a rut, you need luck  
And your stuck and don't know how (oh)  
  
(don't have to be) A big bucks Hollywood star  
(don't have to drive)A super car to get far  
(don't have to wear)A smile much colder than ice  
(don't have to be beautiful but it's nice  
  
You need more than Gerhard Richter hangin' on your wall  
A chauffeur-driven limousine on call  
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball  
  
(you need more, you need more, you need more,  
You need more,you need more,you need more) you need love  
I believe that we can achieve the love that we need  
I believe, call me naive  
Love is for free  
  
(don't have to be) A big bucks Hollywood star  
(don't have to drive)A super car to get far  
(don't have to live)A life of power and wealth  
(don't have to be) beautiful but it helps  
Beautiful that it helps  
Beautiful that it helps

Love is a catastrophe  
Look what it's done to me  
Brought me down here so low  
Stranded, nowhere to go  
  
No concentration  
Just rerunning conversation  
Trying to understand  
How I fell into this quicksand  
  
What happens next?  
With life I'm unimpressed  
Pain like a cutter's knife  
Never been lonelier in my life  
  
Who issued the instruction  
For this mad act of destruction?  
An end to equilibrium  
Fate laughs:  
Look what we've done to him!  
  
High wind through the trees  
Falling November leaves  
A weak sun hanging low  
Summer seems so long ago  
  
All my former dreams  
Tender romantic schemes  
Revealed as so naive  
To think I could believe  
  
In love as the kindest law  
Not as a declaration of war  
On my life and sanity  
Now I know at last for me  
Love is a catastrophe

Shadows on the sun  
Another night's begun  
It's always dark  
In Luna Park  
Wind across the moon  
Electric storms and soon  
A flying spark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when we're getting higher  
We're happy  
Somebody's eating fire  
We're happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Come on, join a line  
The ghost train leaves on time  
It's always dark  
In Luna Park  
On the shooting range  
The plastic prizes never change  
So make your mark  
On Luna Park  
  
And when we're getting higher  
We're happy  
Somebody's eating fire  
We're happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Thunder. I wonder?  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It can't be dark  
Too soon  
  
A storm is coming soon  
Like dust on the moon  
  
Every night we go  
To the latest horror show  
And hear the screams  
In Luna dreams  
Fortune-tellers muse  
On palms that bode bad news  
The future's dark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when we're feeling scared  
We're happy  
With circuses and bread  
We're happy  
The whirling fair machines  
Are all we need  
  
Thunder. I wonder?  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It can't be dark  
Too soon

You seem to be inevitable to me  
Like a memory of the future  
I was and will be with you  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now I'm in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
You,you,you,you  
  
You unlock the past,  
So many scenes moving fast  
At last the right conclusion  
Or at least a sweet illusion  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now I'm in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
  
You seem to be a perfect memory  
Of the future, reminding me  
How life is meant to be  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now I'm in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
  
It's taking me all of my life

Please allow me to try and explain  
I'm living proof that man can change  
I knew what I wanted  
I knew how to get it  
  
It didn't make it happy so I started again  
What I wanted to be was a family man  
But nature had some alternative plans  
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold  
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
  
But every now and then  
Often at night  
A particular feeling would surface in spite  
Of what I told myself and tried to deny  
I kept on asking the question: why?  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
With time and age I had to change  
Cause my behaviour was getting strange  
People on the street caught my eye  
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy  
  
The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge  
Was in retreat and I was on the verge  
Of falling in love or having fun  
Time was running out  
Something had to be done  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
Where was I?  
Laying down the law  
Dancing with others  
Out on the floor  
  
Music and smoke  
What did it mean?  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
I had what I wanted  
  
Madly in love  
Nothing else mattered  
This was enough  
Questions were answered  
Which used to perplex  
In particular those about the big s.e.x.  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about love  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
Dreaming is easy  
Life is tough  
I got the picture  
The most important thing  
  
Is not to end up bitter  
Cause when you start to feel  
Increasingly forlorner  
Woomph! love comes  
Right around the corner  
  
It may not last  
But here am I  
Once a caterpillar  
Now a butterfly  
It can seem strange  
But when you reminisce  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
M I N I M A L  
Minimal (minimal), minimal (minimal)  
M I N I M A L  
Minimal (minimal), minimal  
  
White on white  
Light, sublime  
Subliminal  
The void is clean  
A cell, but not for a criminal  
  
Light and shade  
Time and space  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Draw a line  
More is less  
Is minimal  
The form of life  
Decide something less decisional (decisional)  
  
Light and shade  
Time and space  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Minimal, minimal)  
Void is clean  
  
An empty box  
An open space  
A single thought  
Leaves a trace  
  
An empty box  
An open space  
A single thought  
Leaves a trace  
  
Light (light), and shade (shade)  
Time (time) and space

Clouds drift away  
When they see you  
Rain wouldn't dare  
To fall near you here  
Miracles happen  
When you're around  
Somehow the grass is much greener  
Rivers flow faster and cleaner  
Being with you  
No matter where  
Sunlight breaks through  
And suddenly there's  
  
A bluer sky  
Whenever you're around  
You always bring  
A bluer sky  
A brighter day  
  
Thunder is silent before you  
Roses bloom more to adore you too  
Miracles happen  
When you're around  
The sunset is deeper and longer  
The scent of the jasmine is stronger  
Stray dogs don't bite  
Birds start to sing  
Lightening daren't strike  
You suddenly bring  
  
A bluer sky  
Whenever you're around  
You always bring  
A bluer sky  
A brighter day  
Birds fly  
Even higher in the sky  
Sun shines  
It's a new day

Coming soon  
Something good  
Something we can share  
Understood  
Could be better news  
We can share  
Something's coming soon  
I hear it everywhere  
  
(live it) it's the story of our lives  
(come give it) it's the way we've always been  
(come give it) though the mountains may divide  
(come give it) we can reach the sea  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
In the air I can feel  
Something magical becoming real  
From the other side looking in  
Come on, throw the dice  
And tonight we'll win  
  
(live it) it's the story of our lives  
(come give it) it's the way we've always been  
(come give it) though the mountains may divide  
(come give it) we can reach the sea  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
Driving through the night  
Just you and me  
Faster than any light  
Something's calling (calling, calling)  
Calling us away  
Do you believe  
Heaven isn't that obvious  
We'll be there in a heartbeat  
  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
It's not as strange as it might seem  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I believe we can change  
We can make it more than a dream  
And I believe we can change  
It's not as strange as it might seem

My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning

My head is spinning  
My head is spinning

My head is spinning  
My head is spinning

My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning  
My head is spinning

So much confusion  
When autumn comes around  
What to do about October  
How to smile behind a frown?  
It's hard to settle down  
  
It's so bemusing  
Will they cancel the parade?  
We marched each October  
Now they say we were never even saved  
We must be very brave  
  
Shall I rewrite or revise  
My October symphony?  
Or as an indication  
Change the dedication  
From revolution to revelation?  
  
So we're all drinking  
As leaves fall to the ground  
Because we've been thinking  
How October's let us down  
Then and now  
  
Shall we remember  
December instead?  
Or worry about February?  
Mourn our war-torn dead  
Never seeing red?  
  
Shall I rewrite or revise  
My October symphony?  
Or as an indication  
Change the dedication  
From revolution to revelation?  

A nervous boy in several ways  
I never knew the world could operate this way  
I was nervous when we stopped to speak  
And the world came crashing around my feet  
  
We don't talk of love  
We're much too shy  
But nervously we wonder when and why  
  
A nervous boy, in spite of which  
I never thought I could tremble as much as this  
Your flashing eyes and sudden smiles  
Are never quite at ease, and neither am I  
  
Oh, we'll talk about it all some night  
But nervously we never get it  
Right  
From the start I approved of you  
Right from the moment you turned to face me  
  
A nervous boy from another town  
With a nervous laugh and a concentrated frown  
I spoke too fast with watchful eyes  
Of a recent past and some nostalgic surprise  
  
We don't talk of love  
We're much too shy  
But nervously we wonder when and  
Smile  
Knowing why I approved of you  
Right from the moment you turned to face me  
  
A nervous boy  

When you're a boy  
Some days are tough  
Lying on your bed  
Playing punk rock and stuff  
Home is a boot camp  
You gotta escape  
Want to go and wander  
In the ticker-tape  
You feel the deals is real  
You're a New York City boy  
So young, so run  
Into New York City  
  
New York City boy  
You'll never have a bored day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
The street is amazing  
The hoochies unreal  
Check out all the hardware  
At the latest deal  
Hear a song  
That's the bomb!  
If you don't get the mix  
It's gone eighty-six  
You feel the deal is real  
You're in New York City  
  
New York City boy  
You'll never have a bored day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
New York City boy  
This is your reward day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
Then as the evening falls  
You can return its calls  
  
You feel the deal is real  
You're a New York City boy  
So young, so run  
Into New York City

This is no time for tears  
Though our hearts are bleeding  
One for all and all for one for freedom  
  
A bird flies across the sea  
Free as his brother, where is the freedom  
We've been dreaming of for so long?  
  
Oh, brother, waiting is so long  
Life is soon over, it can't be wrong  
To cast off chains that still bind us  
Let death remind us we can be strong  
  
Sister, don't let me down, please, don't forsake me  
One for all and all for one for freedom, today  
One for all and all for one means freedom, today

Don't wanna hear the news  
What's going on  
What's coming through  
I don't wanna know  
Don't wanna know  
Just wanna hide away  
Make my escape  
I want the world  
To leave me alone  
Feels like I feel too much  
I've seen too much  
For a little while  
I want to forget  
  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb  
  
Can't find no space to breathe  
World's closing in  
Right on me now  
Well that's how it feels  
That's how it feels  
Too much light  
There's too much sound  
Wanna turn it off  
Wanna shut it out  
I need some relief  
Think that like I think too much  
I've seen too much  
There is just too much  
Thought in my head  
  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be  
  
Taken away from all the madness  
Need to escape  
Escape from the pain  
I'm out on the edge  
About to lose my mind  
For a little while  
For a little while  
I wanna be numb  
  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I don't wanna feel this pain no more  
Wanna lose touch  
I just wanna go and lock the door  
I don't wanna think  
I don't wanna feel nothing  
I wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb  
I just wanna be  
Wanna be numb

Have you heard the news?  
Everybody's asking who  
Is that man you've been seen with  
And why I'm never out with you  
  
Please, tell me that you love me  
Sort out this confusion  
Say our love is still alive  
For people must be jumping  
To the wrong conclusion  
But one and one make five  
  
What I need right now  
Is to hear you say they got it wrong  
That he's just a new friend  
A perfectly innocent one  
  
So, tell me that you love me  
Sort out this confusion  
Say our love is still alive  
For people must be jumping  
To the wrong conclusion  
But one and one make five  
People are assuming  
'Cause it's so confusing  
But one and one make five  
  
If one and one make two (make two)  
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
Don't need to worry about you  
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
If you hear gossip and rumor thrive  
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
One and one add up to three, four or five  
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
  
One and one and one and one and one make five  
(One and one make five)  
  
Let's stay in tonight  
Maybe disconnect the phone  
The correct arithmetic  
Just two of us at home  
  
Oh, tell me that you love me  
Sort out this confusion  
Say our love is still alive  
(One and one make five)  
For people must be jumping  
To the wrong conclusion  
But one and one make five

(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
Don't need to worry about you  
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go  
I don't need to worry about you  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
Don't need to worry about you  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  
One and one make two (make two)  
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)  

Why  
This uncertainty?  
It's not clear to me  
Would you rather be independent?  
Have I lost your love?  
Have you had enough?  
Do you feel too much resentment?  
How can I make you see  
When you disagree  
That you just can't leave?  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  
  
I  
Won't stand in your way  
I can make you stay  
Though, of course, I feel rejected  
You're a part of me  
You're the family  
I can't bear to leave  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  
  
Feel  
Free  
To leave  
If you think you're trapped, but  
Please  
Believe  
I'll always want you back  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  
  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  
  
One in a million men  
Could change the way you feel  
One in a million men  
Baby it's up to me  

The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone  
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home  
Tonight I've been walking in the rain  
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame  
  
Chained, framed, you know what I mean  
Push me in a corner and I'll scream  
Just give me one more, one more chance  
One more, one more chance  
  
I will find out wherever you are  
Drinking in another club or driving in your car  
Walking through empty streets  
Stupid fool, that was yours for keeps  
  
Chained, framed, you know what I mean  
Push me in a corner and I'll scream  
One more, one more chance  
Give me one more, one more chance  
Give me one more, one more chance  
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight

I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains  
Let's make lots of  
  
I've had enough of scheming and messing around with jerks  
My car is parked outside, I'm afraid it doesn't work  
I'm looking for a partner, someone who gets things fixed  
Ask yourself this question, Do you want to be rich?  
  
I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains

You can tell I'm educated, I studied at the Sorbonne  
Doctored in mathematics, I could have been a don  
I can program a computer, choose the perfect time  
If you've got the inclination, I have got the crime  
  
Oh, there's a lot of opportunities  
If you know when to take them, you know?  
There's a lot of opportunities  
If there aren't, you can make them  
Make or break them  
  
I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
Let's make lots of  
Money  
  
You can see I'm single-minded, I know what I could be  
How'd you feel about it, come and take a walk with me?  
I'm looking for a partner, regardless of expense  
Think about it seriously, you know, it makes sense  
  
Let's (Got the brains)  
Make (Got the looks)  
Let's make lots of money (Oh money)  
(Let's) You've got the brawn  
(Make) I've got the brains

Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me?  
Why aren't we holding hands and talking sweets?  
I love you really, though I know no-one believes me  
There's chaos every time we meet  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!  
  
You're crashing everywhere, it's like you're smashing china  
Skidding on an icy road  
You're major trouble since you were almost a minor  
I sometimes think we'll both explode  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
My world's gone mad, what did you do?  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!  
  
I can't make sense of anything  
All I know is the party's in full swing  
If we both just stopped for a minute  
I declare war and then you'd win it  
  
To tell you the truth, I thought I was shockproof  
Until I saw what you get up to  
When you think about it, it's quite an achievement  
That after all I still love you  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
My world's gone mad, what did you do?  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!

Now you've gone, I'm all alone  
My heart is broken and I don't wanna go home  
You know it's all over, you're out of luck  
You feel so low you wanna self-destruct  
I needed you and you loved me too  
But now I don't know what I'm gonna do  
But life moves on, I'm talking history  
And now I've got to find someone who'll dance with me  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
You, you were my lover

You've got a problem  
With the reason why  
An asymmetric haircut  
And a painted eye  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
  
Is it a cry for help  
Or call to arms?  
Frustration  
False alarms  
It's psychological  
(All in the mind)  
  
There's something in the attic  
And it smells so bad  
An undertaker  
In a bowler hat  
(Psychological)  
What's that spilt  
On the kitchen floor?  
Who's that knocking  
On the cellar door?  
It's psychological  
Or is it only your imagination?  
Driving me crazy, crazy  
Baby, baby, please  
  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry  
I thought I heard a train  
Down in the cemetery  
Cellophane  
  
It's second nature to you  
All in the mind  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)

I thought it was like a film  
Reviewed but never seen  
Where everybody played themselves  
As a drama king or queen  
  
The music was overwhelming  
Glitter in and fiend  
Some are chavy like a requiem  
In Denim and Leopardskin  
  
I visualise the flashbacks  
School, home cross obsess  
Heart is too much of everything  
The cliches, the candles, the mess  
  
Lucy and I never seen with David  
Brian never talks  
Help me in policks and sense in Arnold  
Tell me all about Reddocks  
Ozzy's last collection  
Beavis closed himself  
A little more rouge and powder cheeks  
But the base is pay off  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
In ended with a motorbike  
A search for every dance  
Pouring over our photographs  
To make it all fake sense  
Glomorous in it's own way  
Shouting above the dead  
Some are chavy like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
Janice and Marlyn, Ronald Creepers  
Malcom's around the block  
Adam's in the jungle film  
But Luc has let it walk  
The Johnsons and the Jenkins  
Hail by keeping smile  
All you need to make it big  
It takes some style  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
Requiem in denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye

I don't care what these commentators say  
I swear I don't care  
For what difference do they make?  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Don't stop me  
I know that it's not gonna last  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
If you see someone gorgeous  
Then you think am I in with a chance?  
Should I try?  
Buy a rink?  
Or maybe it's too much  
Like hard work tonight  
But if they look my way  
I might alright  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Don't stop me  
I know that it's not gonna last  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever

I've watched you from a distance  
I've passed you on the street  
I''m obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you pay attention  
and fall in love with me  
I'm obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've called you from the corner  
You don't pick up the phone  
I'm depressed by you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you understand me  
To hear you speak my name  
I''m impressed with you  
I could impress you too  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've explained it in my letters  
I'm miserable as sin  
I''m obsessed with you  
What am I gonna do?  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside

Come outside and see a brand new day  
The troubles in your mind will blow away  
It's easy to believe they're here to stay  
But you won't find them standing in your way  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Although we see the world through different eyes  
We share the same idea of paradise  
So don't search in the starts for signs of love  
Look around your life, you'll find enough  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Why do you want to sit alone in Gothic gloom  
Surrounded by the ghosts of love that haunt your room?  
Somewhere there's a different door to open wide  
You gotta throw those skeletons out of your closet and come outside  
  
So you will see a brand new day  
The troubles in your mind will blow away  
It's easy to believe they're here to stay  
But you won't find them standing in your way  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young  
  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
Come on, essa vida e  
That's the way life is, that's the way life is  
  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Come outside and feel the morning sun  
Se a vida e, I love you  
Life is much more simple when you're young

He believed if you had a little faith  
you could stop the rain  
and he believed if you got a little love  
it would ease the pain  
but still he's suffering  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Looking for the light we need  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
painted in the blood we bleed  
  
By the side of a giant swimming-pool  
with a mystic book  
Hanging out with the guys and playing the fool  
fat as King Farouk  
but look he's suffering  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
downtown Memphis, Tennessee  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Science is a mystery  
  
Oh and sometimes there's a close shave  
They come, they go  
Keeps the flowers fresh at his mom's grave  
and talks to her as though...  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Looking for the light we need

Do you believe in heaven above?  
Do you believe in love?  
Don't tell me a lie  
Don't be false or untrue  
It all comes back to you  
  
Open fire on my burning heart  
I've never been lucky in love  
My defenses are down  
A kiss or a frown  
I can't survive on my own  
  
If a girl walks in  
And carves her name in my heart  
I'll turn and run away  
Everyday we've all been led astray  
  
It's hard to be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now right now  
  
Empty dreams can only disappoint  
In a room behind your smile  
But don't give up don't give up  
You can be lucky in love

I doublecross you  
And you get mysterious mail  
I've tried hard not to shock you  
It's hard not to with the things I could say  
Tell me why don't we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?  
Why don't we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?  
  
You lock your letters in a box  
And you've hidden the key  
I go one better, I'm indebted  
To a contact magazine  
Tell me why don't we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?  
Why don't we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for us?  
  
Everybody's got to live together  
Just to find a little peace of mind there  
If you give up your affairs forever  
I will give up mine  
But it's hard  
So hard  
  
I'm always hoping you'll be faithful  
But you're not, I suppose  
We've both given up smoking 'cause it's fatal  
So whose matches are those?  
Tell me why don't we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?  
  
We make it so hard

Somebody's life  
  
He loves her  
But he sometimes thinks she's crazy  
Laughing  
The next minute mad  
And saying  
'I think you're wasting my time'  
Crying  
Then changing her mind  
  
She's screaming and shouting  
And everything's blinding  
She's laughing out loud  
And busy 'cause she's minding  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody else's business  
Somebody's life  
  
She suffers  
From such violent mood swings  
He says  
They disagree  
He loves her  
And life is never boring  
Some say  
It's just being free  
  
She's screaming and shouting  
And everything's blinding  
She's laughing out loud  
And busy 'cause she's minding  
Somebody else's business

Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia  
(Where the suburbs met Utopia)  
  
Lost in the high street, where the dogs run  
Roaming suburban boys  
Mother's got a hairdo to be done  
She says they're too old for toys  
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen  
In this suburban hell  
And in the distance a police car  
To break the suburban spell  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
Break a window by the town hall  
Listen, the siren screams  
There in the distance, like a roll call  
Of all the suburban dreams  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
(Hang around, hang around)  
  
It's on the front page of the papers  
This is their hour of need  
Where's a policeman when you need one  
To blame the colour TV?  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
  
Run with the dogs tonight  
You can't hide

I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly, I realised  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
The wind was chilly and the sky was dull  
I went for shelter to the temple  
Once inside I couldn't believe my eyes  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
Go to a club, you think I'll be there  
I don't go 'cause I'm not a member  
You said you went to apologize  
It's plain to me that's one more lie  
That's my impression [Repeats]

I was backstage  
Couldn't believe my luck was in  
I saw him approach  
Wearing a most approachable grin  
When he said hello  
I was surprised he spoke so politely  
I said I'd liked his show  
Well he just smiled  
I guess it happens nightly  
And so  
I fell in love  
  
We went to his room  
He had a video camera  
I was so nervous  
I had to try hard not to stammer  
He said  
'I'm glad you liked the show  
That crowd was dope out there tonight, alright  
You want to see some more?  
Well be my guest  
You can have a private performance'  
I'd fallen in love  
  
I didn't ask why  
Though he seemed like such a regular guy  
He said we could be  
Secret lovers  
Just him and me  
Then he joked  
'Hey, man!  
Your name isn't Stan, is it?  
We should be together!'  
And he was passionate  
I guess I would rate  
Him a nine out of ten  
By then  
I'd fallen in love  
  
When I asked  
Why have I heard so much  
About him being charged  
With homophobia and stuff  
He just shrugged  
  
Next morning we woke  
He couldn't have been a nicer bloke  
Over breakfast made jokes  
About Dre and his homies and folks  
Neither of us asked if or when  
We would see each other again  
But I thought that was cool  
'cause I was already late for school  
By then  
I'd fallen in love

The only one  
  
I think of you  
And wonder who  
You are and what's your line  
I wonder if  
There's someone else  
Or if it's true that I'm  
The only one  
In your life  
I only worry  
For your own sake  
I don't know much about  
The deals you make  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one?  
The only one  
  
(The only one  
The only one  
The only one)  
  
I don't know you  
You don't know me  
I wonder what we share  
It's just that now  
And then you smile  
And suddenly I know you care  
And I'm the only one  
For a while  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one  
  
(The only one)  
(Only one)  
  
As enigmatic  
As you can be  
I'm not suspicious  
Naturally  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one  
In your life?  
  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one

Cross a windy bridge one winter night  
Past Embankment Gardens  
Enter warmth and light  
Face the music (it's never easy)  
Forget the chill  
Face the future (it's never easy)  
Find the will  
If live is worth living  
It's got to be done  
One might be forgiven  
For thinking it's a life on the run  
Many roads will cross through many lives  
But somehow you survive  
Look around  
Picture what's in store  
Is this the final edit  
Or is the subject now a bore?  
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)  
You can't ignore  
That life is worth living  
It's still worth a damn  
One might be forgiven for thinking  
It's something of a sham  
Many words may make it sound contrived  
But somehow we're alive  
(The Survivors)  
Our heads bowed  
(The Survivors)  
At memorials for other faces  
In the crowd  
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)  
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins  
(It's never easy)  
Or twinsets-and-pearls  
If life is worth living  
It's got to be run as a means of giving  
Not as a race to be won  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll arrive  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll survive  

I'm here, you're there  
Come closer, tonight I'm lonely  
Come here with me  
I want it the way it used to be  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who would even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
I can remember days of sun  
We knew our lives had just begun  
We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young  
Under the moon, address unknown  
I can remember nights in Rome  
I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone  
  
I'd survive with only memories  
If I could change the way I feel  
But I want more than only memories  
A human touch to make them real  
  
Another day, another dream  
Over the bridge an empty scene  
We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  
I don't know why we moved away  
Lost in the here and now we strayed  
Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed  
  
I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue  
You elsewhere with Culver City blues  
Then and there I knew that I'd lost you  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who will even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
Don't give me all your love and pain  
Don't sell me New York in the rain  
Let's leave our promises behind  
Rewind and try again  
  
What remains in time that didn't fade away?  
Sometimes I need to see  
The way it used to be

(Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody jump to attention...)  
  
Each morning after Sunblest  
Feel the benefit, mental arithmetic  
I waited by the staffroom  
In time for benediction  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
  
To our voices nobody's listening  
We shiver in the rain by the touchline  
Then a coach ride to the station  
"My lord, the carriage awaiteth!"  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
How long?  
  
I'm listening to the words I thought I'd never hear again  
A litany of saints and other ordinary men  
Kneeling on the parquet  
Whatever has gone wrong?  
The fear and feeling hopelessness  
I don't want to belong  
  
I dreamt I was back in uniform  
And a candidate for examination  
History, someone had blundered  
And a voice rapped "knuckle under!"  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
And how  
How long?

I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Why don't we turn the whole bloody lot down  
And make a new start all over again?  
  
I can recall Utopian thinking  
Bold mission statements and tightening of belts  
Demolition of familiar landmarks  
Promises made and deals that were dealt  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
But that future was exciting  
Science fiction made fact  
Now all we have to look forward to  
Is a sort of suicide pact  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
I can remember planning for leisure  
Living in peace and freedom from fear  
Science that promised to make us a new world  
Religion and prejudice disappear  
  
I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
To threaten, oh God! Amen  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
Oh God! Amen  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
Amen

You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
If you don't believe what I have said  
Take a look, my eyes are red  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
But all those sleepless night in bed  
When you've been out somewhere instead  
I wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
A lawyer with a case to prove  
Would sift the evidence, then move  
It's the only thing to do  
So why then can't I face the facts?  
Sift this evidence that backs  
I am so in love with you  
But all the nights when you have said  
You must be somewhere else instead  
I wonder where you go, but daren't expose the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
You are the only one, the only one  
  
You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
If you don't believe what I have said  
Take a look, my eyes are red  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
But all the nights you don't show up  
I know it's time I should grow up  
I ask you if you care, you stand and stare aloof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth  

We've been around forever  
Look at us now together  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to men friends  
Smiling across a friend's friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
We'll stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love, and getting  
Nothing that's worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware  
But once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare (oh)

Together we'll go all the way  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
Give me what I need from you  
Anything you want to do  
I'm gonna need to follow through  
  
Everything I have is yours  
I pray you understand because  
Whatever you want to do  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Now my heart is beating fast  
Time is short, the die is cast  
I can keep a secret  
If you can really mean it and  
  
Feel the luck beside us  
And so much love inside us  
Whatever we have to do  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Everything's easy  
In this state of mind  
The world starts to fade  
As we leave it behind  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
Together we'll go all the way

Oh, I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
That I don't think we can just dismiss  
After one hundred years  
Of inhumanity  
The lesson that I learned was this:  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Well I bought a ticket  
To the revolution  
And I cheered when the statues fell  
Everyone came  
To destroy what was rotten  
But they killed off what was good as well  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Stay with me  
This century  
Together we're better  
  
Oh, I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
It may seem somewhat hit or miss  
If you've certainty  
'Bout the way it's all meant to be  
The lesson that you need is this:  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together

News in the city breaks without pity  
Long after the war has ended  
We're still in fatigues  
Up against it  
The higher you fly the further you fall  
Up against it  
Wondering why we fought after all  
Such a cold winter with scenes  
As slow as Pinter  
Synchronise your watches  
There's still time to kill  
Up against it  
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works  
Wrapped in nostalgia to queue for a show  
Back to Trafalgar one kiss then I'll go  
So deep in quicklime  
The bones of an old crime  
I knew a man who raked them over  
He's still suffering  
Up against it  
Buried so deep  
It gives me the creeps  
Up against it  
The longer you hate  
The more that it grates  
Up against it  
Look left then right  
And run for your Life  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works  

Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Say what you like  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Sun in the kitchen  
Boy, you're still sleeping  
When you get hungry  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Night in the city  
New Orleans pretty  
Do what you want  
And then can I do it to you?  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
It's a reflex  
Just a reflex  
Like fear or sex  
  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Say what you like  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry

The sons and brothers, fighting for another cause  
Anything to give their lives some meaning  
Busy with their guns and dreaming  
Far away from here  
Said they would act in self-defense  
  
And all the others, running 'round so hot and bothered  
Anything to give their lives some meaning  
In the evening  
Running around with guns and  
Said they would act in self-defense  
With violence  
  
Violence  
Violence  
Violence breeds  
Violence  
Violence breeds  
  
The son and brother, when he gets home  
He gives someone some love  
And mutters: "Woman, you'll never understand  
I did what I said in self-defense  
With violence"  
  
Violence breeds  
Violence  
Violence breeds  
Violence  
Violence breeds  
Violence  

Well I don't know why I was dreaming about you  
But I do know that I was dancing without you  
Then you smiled, and I was lost  
You fall in love, why count the cost?  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth living for  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth giving more  
  
If I'd had my way this would have happened much sooner  
But until that day it was only a rumour  
All at once you changed my life  
And led me in to paradise  
  
Where I had to do  
What I wanted to  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I reserve the right to live  
My life this way, and I don't give  
A damn when I hear people say  
I'll pay the price that others pay  
  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I reserve (what?)  
The right to live (where?)  
My life this way (how?)  
I couldn't give  
A damn when I (what?)  
Hear people say (who?)  
I'll pay the price  
That others pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why

The music's pumping through me, I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me, the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me, and I know I want it now  
These feelings that I'm feeling must be satisfied somehow  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My body surges with energy, shivers down my spine  
I look deep into your eyes, and I know that you'll be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The music's pumping through me, I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me, the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me, and I know I want it now  
These feelings that I'm feeling must be satisfied somehow  
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it!  
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it!  
  
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it!  
  
[Chorus]

Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've changed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We're blamed  
We're all criminals now  
  
Just a routine procedure  
(We're watching you)  
A sample of your dna  
(The things you do)  
Queuing to be finger-printed  
(You could be dangerous)  
Going to the usa  
Another routine procedure  
(We're on your case)  
Driving in your car  
(We've seen your face)  
Stopped and searched and questioned  
(Some place before)  
Can you prove who you are?  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've changed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've been framed  
We're all criminals now  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey, hey  
We're all criminals now  
  
Got the bus to the station  
Music playing in my head  
Ran to get on the tube train  
Police shot someone dead  
  
Don't ask me how We're all criminals now  
  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We're blamed  
We're all criminals now  
Hey, hey  
Don't ask me how  
We've been framed  
We're all criminals now

We're the Pet Shop Boys  
Suburbia's a slipstream  
To a memory  
Of a time when you were  
Close to me  
I pretend  
I'm there again  
I close my eyes and see you  
Better than before  
Then I feel you touch me  
And it's 1984  
I know what you will say  
Before you start  
In my heart  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Every thought's a fashion  
Or a crime  
And every boy is just  
A waste of time  
But I pretend  
It was different then  
Maybe it's a habit  
Maybe it's a sin  
But I find out  
When I try it on  
It crawls beneath my skin  
Once it gets inside me  
It won't go  
Now I know  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Rent  
Shopping  
Being boring  
It's alright  
It's a sin  
I'm not scared  
In denial  
I want a dog  
I want a lover  
Can you forgive her?  
Do I have to?  
What have I? What have I?  
What have I done to deserve this?  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys

(....forever)  
Sometimes you're better off dead  
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head  
You think you're mad, too unstable  
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables  
In a restaurant in a West End town  
Call the police, there's a madman around  
Running down underground to a dive bar  
In a West End town  
  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
West End girls  
  
Too many shadows, whispering voices  
Faces on posters, too many choices  
If, when, why, what?  
How much have you got?  
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?  
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?  
(How much do you need?)  
  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
West End girls  
West End girls  
  
(How much do you need?)  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
Oooh West End town, a dead end world  
East End boys, West End Girls  
West End girls  
  
You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone  
Just you wait 'til I get you home  
We've got no future, we've got no past  
Here today, built to last  
In every city, in every nation  
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station  
(How far have you been?)  
  
In a West End town, a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
A West End town, a dead end world  
East End Boys, West End girls  
West End girls  
  
West End girls  
West End girls  
(How far have you been?)  
  
Girls  
East End boys  
And West End girls  
And West End girls  
(... forever)  
And West End girls  
(How far have you been?)  
  
East End boys  
The West End girls  
The West End boys  
And West End girls  
  
The West End girls  
The West End boys  
The West End girls

You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job.  
I've always worked for a living.  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
Now you've left me with nothing.  
(Can't take it.)  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
I brought you drinks, I brought you flowers,  
I read your books and talked for hours ev'ry day.  
So many drinks, such pretty flow'rs, so tell me.  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
  
What have I, what have I, what have I  
Since you went away.  
I've been hanging around.  
I've been wondering why  
I'm feeling down.  
You went away.  
It should make me feel better  
But I don't know  
  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
Gonna get through. (Gonna get through.)  
  
You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job.  
Now I can do what I want to forever.  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
At night the people come and go, they talk to fast and walk to slow  
Chasing time from hour to hour, I pour the drinks and crush the flowers.  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
Gonna get through. (Gonna get through.)  

There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all of the parties every night  
They're not enough  
You want something more (Tell me)  
I want you  
I want you  
  
(Tell)  
(Tell)  
  
I find you when I want you  
And lose you late at night  
The woman in me shouts out  
The man in me just smiles  
I may not always love you  
You may not care  
But if we should live together  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby))  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
We'll find a home together  
(Baby) And sleep there every night  
(Baby) There's a time and place for most things  
(Baby) This time we'll get it right  
(Aah) You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Baby)  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together?  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby)  
(Ooh, baby, baby, why don't we live?)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
(Baby) You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Ooh ooh))  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby, baby))  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide ((Baby))  
  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby, Ooh, baby)  
(Saying why don't we live together)  
  
You won't believe until the day you try ((Baby, baby))  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
Why don't we live together?  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Ooh ooh)  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby)  
Without the love, love you feel inside

This is the moment, we'll remember  
Every day for the rest of out lives  
Time may rush us, hurt or love us  
  
But on this day we have arrived  
  
It's been a long time coming  
We've been in the running for so long  
But now we're on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
I've been a loser, I've paid my dues  
I fought my way up from the ground  
Now at this moment, the crowd acclaim us  
Will you just listen to that song  
  
It's been a long time coming  
We've been in the running for so long  
But now we're on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
It took us so long  
And we worked so hard  
We came so far just to compete  
But don't forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
Looking back on all the times  
We felt downcast  
Didn't think we were going anywhere  
Just living in the past  
But in that desperation  
You get inspiration  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
'Cause you're a winner  
Took so long, we worked so hard  
We came so far and just to compete  
But don't forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is hapWening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
'Cause you're a winner

Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good  
I enjoyed that, though, of course, no one understood  
A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue  
They couldn't understand your sense of humour like I do  
  
You're much too kind  
I smiled with murder on my mind  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
You have a certain quality, which really is unique  
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak  
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud  
Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out  
  
You hated me too  
But not as much as I hated you  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
Then, when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind  
  
Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners  
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner  
And someone said: "It's fabulous you're still around today,  
You've both made such a little go a very long way"  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
Then, when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind  

He's gone  
You've lost  
Stay behind  
And count the cost  
You try  
You lose  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose  
  
It's a decision  
Made over time  
Should you take a risk  
And start to climb  
The steepest hill  
Only to find  
Halfway there  
You've been left behind?  
  
Choosing to love  
Is risking a lot  
And trying to change  
And to give all you've got  
But don't pretend  
It comes out of the blue  
You take a chance  
And see it through  
And if it's refused  
What can you do?  
Continue hopefully?  
Start anew?  
  
Lick your wounds  
Buy your booze  
You won't get drunk by accident  
You'll choose  
Don't blame him  
For refusing your bid  
He didn't decide to love  
You did  
  
Learn the lesson  
Take the blows  
You didn't fall in love by chance  
You chose  
Play the sad songs  
Sing the blues  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose

What a performance tonight  
Should I react or turn off the light?  
Looks like you're picking a fight  
In a blurring of wrong and right  
But how your mood changes  
You're a devil, now an angel  
Suddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monk  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
It's better than nothing  
I suppose  
Some doors have opened,  
Others closed  
But I couldn't see you exposed  
To the horrors behind some of those  
Somebody said: listen  
Don't you know what  
You're missing? You should be kissing him  
Instead of dissing him like a punk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
All of my friends keep asking me  
Why, oh why  
Do you not say goodbye?  
If you don't even try  
You'll be sunk  
?Cause you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
What's the meaning  
When you speak with so much feeling?  
Is it over when you're sober?  
Am I junk?  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  

We've been around forever  
Look at us now together  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to manfriends  
Smiling across a friend's friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
(Ta da da da da aah Ta da da da da)  
  
We'll stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love, and getting  
Nothing that's worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware (aah)  
But once in a while  
A smile, if you dare (aah)  
  
(Aah, Aah, Aah)  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware (aah)  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare (oooh)  
  
(Aaah Aaah Oooh)  
  
(Aaahhh)
