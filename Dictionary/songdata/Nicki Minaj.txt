You'll be falling for me boy, yeah  
Just like a domino tonight tonight (ni-i-ight)

Systematically I'm droppin' your heat

I hate it when ever body is scared of the badman coz  
He's scary, but deep down he's about as hard as a fairy, I'll  
Rape his mum if her fannys not to hairy,  
And she's a muddafucking virgin like mary,  
  
Soon ssimon cowell will be signing me a petition,  
To be number one in the world is my ambition,  
I guess I can do it it's my decision,  
  
Soon I'll be the fucking talk off the town,  
I'm the muddafuknig king so wheres my muddafuknig crown,  
I'll sell more records then jay sean -down,  
  
My lyricks will get read more then a nursery full of  
Kids reading noahs ark,  
You might be a pittbull but I'm a fucking shark,  
I'll drop bombs like a taliban in iraq,  
  
Yeah I'm gonna doit I'll walk the walk and I'll talk the talk,  
I'll eat you like a cannabis stalk,  
You may be black but I'm as white as chalk  
  
I'm only 14 and writing my bars in school,  
Everybody nos me as tom robbo the kid whos cool,  
I'm gonna batter oli williams whatta fucking fool,  
Sayin I was the one who took a knife when he was the  
One who clearly broguht a tool,

[Chorus:]  
I wanna get to know you  
I really wanna fuck you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply going to drive you crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you crazy  
  
[Young Buc]  
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes  
Swingin' them hips when you pass  
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby  
Jump on this Harley  
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley  
Sip some Bacardi  
Then go pull up at the afterparty  
I think we make a perfect couple  
But you think I'm trouble  
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number  
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"  
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'  
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time  
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine  
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you  
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do  
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long  
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong  
Before I head home  
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn  
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lloyd Banks]  
Bitches be frustrated with the baller  
Wonder why I don't call her  
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her  
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her  
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more  
She loves it when I'm in town  
Hate it when I'm not around  
I get her and wear down  
Next door neighbors hear the sound  
Pictures hittin' the ground  
Just enough to hold us down  
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round  
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy  
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady  
I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[50 Cent]  
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more  
Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man  
I sweet talking her if she like  
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right  
Look I'm legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you  
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me  
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me  
Let me ride on you and you can ride on  
We can do it all the night  
We can have a balla tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, lady  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy  
  
[X2]  
I wanna be your lover  
I really understand you, baby  
I want to be your lover  
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

[Hook: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it  
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Hook: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate  
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend  
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me  
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony  
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Bridge: Skylar]  
So does she know I've been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you  
There's one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
[Outro: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

[Chorus]  
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,  
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing  
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing,  
I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing  
  
Feels like I'm bl'  
  
How could it me, little me  
Had the power to be the best B, in the league  
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me  
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly  
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations  
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em  
The contract is on but I am the addendum  
So wh-where my dogs at, Randy  
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy  
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy  
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi  
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show  
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal  
Before the storm comes the calm  
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,  
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha  
I'm the best now,  
Anybody with some money should invest now  
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'  
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel  
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been  
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win  
I'm on that different type of high, heroin  
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ugh, yea, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak  
While I'm flying with a flow that  
Is the greatest throwback  
Since that Nolan Ryan and the days  
Been crazy and the nights even wilder  
And the lights even brighter,  
Baby stand next to my fire  
Only higher is Messiah  
Or notes from Mariah  
'Rari six hundred horses,  
That's my chariot of fire?  
Where we flying,  
They can't find us all them broke days behind us  
I just took your whole life and redesigned it ugh  
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld  
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell  
I'm a grab your waist then,  
I'm a grab your face and  
Then I'm a taste it,  
Then I'm a blaze it  
Hello all my bad girls,  
This just in  
Yeezy hurt the beat  
Like he fucked her best friend  
And she let him back in  
And he just did it again,  
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end  
I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying  
Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him  
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze  
Her dress is just per' uh  
Prada colored babes  
It obvi' we the ish  
And I'm rolling with my bricks  
So real you so trill baby everything legit  
How you feel, they say we crazed  
Cause our styles so diff'  
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'  
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch  
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib  
Add this, we blazin'  
Nicki what you think,  
I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Sean kingston]  
I was just a player in the game of love  
Til she came and turned me tables around  
Stacking up mi chips  
Lining up all mi cups  
Still they all came tumbling down  
  
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one  
Take them stealing me up on the run  
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done  
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum  
Fly me away, the kingdom come  
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
  
Love was just a word till I bought me a baller  
Oh you everything for holding me down  
I'm telling all my homies that mi find mi a queen  
In the jungle so you facing the crowd  
  
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one  
Take them stealing me up on the run  
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done  
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum  
Fly me away, the kingdom come  
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
I'm saying Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away  
  
If you will die then why would you try  
And if you apply, a suit and a tie  
It's what I will buy then you will be mine  
Because you and I, we're born to be wild  
I am Martha, you King Arthur  
Who knew you would land me  
I be known to eat these rappers, cook 'em like chef Ramsey  
Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice  
Cove on vogue, yeah I'ma go topless  
I'ma go bonkers, I'ma go crazy  
I'ma get reckless then have a baby  
Then hang a baby off on the balcony  
Teach him the moonwalk, Tell him he's japanese  
Yeeeahhh!  
  
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild  
Oh no oh no, till you came around  
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love  
  
Ooooh, I'm blown away  
Ooooh, I'm blown away

[Verse]  
I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor  
And he'll t-t-teach me to-teach me love my neighbor  
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data  
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters  
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures  
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches  
And in a nic of time it just dawned on me  
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me  
But hey, maybe I'll never win  
Maybe I'm settlin'  
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin  
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn (I'm so Marilyn)  
Write it down, take a picture, bitches e-mail that  
I came to save a thing called female rap  
But I hope my ninja powers  
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards  
You mad at me 'cus you think I got it easy  
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me  
But see you still a lil' snotty nose hood rat  
"I love Nicki" scribbled all over you book bag  
I love you too, I just wish ya mother would've hugged you too  
You know Nicki love the kids  
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz  
But when it rains, it pours for real  
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill  
Can't rap and sing on the same cd  
The public won't get it, they got A. D. D.  
See Nicki, follow the rules  
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school  
(Yeah follow the rules, let me say my prayers and get ready for school)  
  
Dear God, I am only what you made me  
And I appreciate everything that you gave me  
But like, I don't wanna do it no more  
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for  
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game  
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name  
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried  
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye  
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him  
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted  
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)  
  
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?  
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?  
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?  
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?

Kidnapping and then rob niggas  
Call D-rock for a biggie  
Pussy ass lil rap niggas  
I fucked with real trap niggas  
Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas  
I'm with ebk, you on ebt  
Got a black nine, call it bet  
School niggas get a ged  
And I tease niggas make em B. E. G  
Got a money fetish, imma fly to Venice  
Got a big house I can play some tennis  
Lil herb, what's good  
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good  
  
[Hook: Lil Herb]  
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide  
When it's drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
One-fifty I'm really wit' it  
I'll drop his ass and then forget it  
I'm the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Herb]  
I'm a young nigga I be getting money  
Take your bitch from you  
And these niggas get no respect  
I'mma stay 100 till I'm 6 under  
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150  
For every nigga that's gon come with me  
I'm on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160  
Smoke a lot a of weed  
Like fuck gimmicks, put a dutch in me  
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any  
And if any nigga ever try to end me  
I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me  
You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?  
Straight killers I can call so many  
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki  
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food  
Shorties standing in the streets with tools  
Where I'm from we don't play no games  
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news  
Where I hang we don't say no names  
If you talk to cop I stay away from you  
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations  
You'll be out the station in a day or two  
Dedication and a little patience  
Leave the domination on my way to greatness  
Don't put yourself up in a situation  
Putting my relations in your conversations  
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation  
You get my position nigga better take it  
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never
made it  
I got old shit, killing your shit  
On a couple tracks I just never played it  
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis  
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis  
  
[Hook: Lil Herb]  
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide  
When it's drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
One-fifty I'm really wit' it  
I'll drop his ass and then forget it  
I'm the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

[Chorus]  
Shitted on 'em,  
Man I just shitted on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Man I just shitted on 'em  
Shitted on 'em,  
Put your number two's in the air if you did it on 'em  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em  
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em  
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em  
Let me shake it off  
I just signed a couple deals I might break you off  
And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator  
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This stone is flawless F-1  
I keep shooters up top in the F-1  
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one  
But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come  
Those some fresh one's  
More talent in my mother fuckin' left thumb  
She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb  
You ain't my son you my mother fuckin' step-son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All these bitches is my sons  
And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix  
Bitch I get money so I do's what I pleases  
I live with the mother fuckin' pools and the trees is  
Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)  
Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty  
Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b  
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me  
I'm the terminator, bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her  
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator  
You my seed I spray you with the germinator  
Move back bugs, matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub  
If you could turn back time, Cher  
You used the be here but now you gone Nair  
  
[Chorus]

I don't wanna sound mad  
I feel marvelous right now  
Dirty money  
  
Tell the bitch with the crown who run like chris brown  
Round three round I'ma need to hundred town  
Like china town bitch is better... Down  
Oh you ain't know bet the bitches know now  
Fuck I gotta let em know that I'm the one  
Way I ride the. They salute me in the slum  
In the six hun' the color the bubble gum

You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down  
Run through the clubs with the baddest

Wasting so much time at disagreeing

Lp460 bitches that's the motto

[Verse 1]  
Am I just a fool?  
Blind and stupid for loving you  
Am I just a silly girl?  
So young and naive to think you were the one who came to take claim of this
heart  
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
And now the people are talking, the people are saying that you have been
playing my heart like a grand piano  
The people are talking, the people are saying that you have been playing my
heart like a grand piano  
So play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on  
  
[Verse 2]  
Am I being a fool?  
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths  
What do I see in you?  
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do  
Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart  
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
[Chorus]

Press that little button on the sit back chair

Why is it that u can see the worst in me

I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me  
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me  
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des  
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces  
Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
  
(I love who I am, I love, whoa)  
  
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old  
And the only thing that change is the price of gold  
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul  
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold  
So do you take me to be who I am?  
To have and to hold till death do us part  
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part  
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?  
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe  
Then you say I won't survive if I leave  
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve  
I no longer need your attention, at ease  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
Now it's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am

Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes  
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape  
Now it's which World Tour should I go on and take  
See you told me I would lose but I won  
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun  
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me  
Australia, Sydney  
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsey  
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah  
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime  
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gone see it in time  
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind  
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas  
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace  
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial  
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear they comin' for me  
Because the top is lonely  
What the fuck they gon' say  
What the fuck they gon' say  
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it  
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
I'm the best  
  
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch  
Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house  
You could never understand why I grind like I do  
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do  
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked  
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track  
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards  
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud  
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand  
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win  
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end  
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in  
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one  
You might get addressed on the second album  
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so  
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah, it's OK  
It's OK, long as you know  
Long as you know  
Long as you motherfuckers know  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
  
[Chorus]

Yo I coulda' been had fame  
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim  
Cause you couldn't around the last name  
So my crossover wins the last game  
And it's ill right?  
Switched up the flow, but it's still right  
Go back to that, yea I still might  
I'ma just do me, when it feel right uh  
You can bring it any day  
Natural Bad Ass, N.B.A.  
That's my initials  
That's why officials  
Don't blow the whistle  
Bang bang the pistol  
And I'm and I'm bossy  
Can't keep these hoes up off me  
Damn the flow nasty, coffee  
Don't treat me like the Pope and cross me  
  
[Chorus]  
Yea this is my last chance oh, last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
  
I get it in though  
No sexual innuendo  
Nobody that I can just depend on  
Until I touchdown in the end zone  
And then they come out like roaches  
P-P-Peck it away like vulchers  
But little did they know  
Distribute the payroll  
Pick up the album, pick up the single  
Sadly, I'm so business savvy  
Similar protocol but the templates vary  
Never been like me and never been like this  
My flows are crisis they scream in high pitch  
Uh gun cock, pause  
And I'm well aware of the gun laws  
Telling 'em that I'm running for the top Forbes  
Headed-to-the-top dot org  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time  
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes  
Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time  
Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky  
  
Yea this is my last chance oh, last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
  
Only one chance one bullet in the gun  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The saftey's off and I put on stars  
Oh stick 'em up, stick 'em up  
Ready to shoot  
Yeah yeah I'm ready to shoot  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The saftey's off and I put on stars  
Get ready, I'm ready to shoot

In this very moment I'm king

And I dictate how I'm gon piece the pie

'Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin  
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans

And let me get in my truck  
'Cause all them' bitches'll catch it  
Wait wait wait, there I go again

Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet - sweet and sour  
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible  
Ah! I don't know what y'all on - please

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Here we go again, it's the game we love  
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs  
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs  
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged  
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs  
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves  
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs  
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs  
  
[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Are you alone? Do you need someone?  
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?  
Thousand words don't change a thing  
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
Where did you go? Couldn't see  
I was too busy  
Could've just said no  
Where would you go? I think that I know  
  
[Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o  
We're back to playing, we're back to playing  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o  
We're back to playing, the crying game  
  
[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Jessie Ware)] (x2)  
I could've given everything  
Don't wanna let the tears begin  
(We're back to playing, the crying game)  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul  
Where it ain't no Easy Pass, you got to use the toll  
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control  
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes  
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious  
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?  
Another slap to the face, another uppercut  
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya  
Not cause I wanna, get someone to imitate ya  
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya  
But is you stayin' or goin'?  
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it  
How come you never show it?  
All this love you speak of  
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)  
  
[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win  
And I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
Where did you go? Couldn't see  
I was too busy  
Could've just said no  
Where would you go? I think that I know  
  
[Chorus: Jessie Ware]  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o  
We're back to playing, we're back to playing  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o  
We're back to playing, the crying game  
  
[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Jessie Ware)] (x2)  
I could've given everything  
Don't wanna let the tears begin  
(We're back to playing, the crying game)  
  
[Outro: Jessie Ware]  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o  
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o

[Verse 1]  
Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted  
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it  
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted  
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted  
This what you came, this what you came for  
You get what you buy, this what you paid for  
So make sure the stars is what you aim for  
Make mistakes though  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I never worry, life is a journey  
I just wanna enjoy the ride  
What is the hurry? It's pretty early  
It's ok, we'll take our time  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
The night is still young  
The night is still young  
The night is still young  
And so are we  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me  
We ain't going nowhere like tanks on E  
We still getting money, which bank is it gonna be?  
If he sexy, he planking on me  
So when them big boys want all of that  
Tell the bartender, say my order back  
It's bottle service, he ordered that  
Might let him take it home and slaughter that  
He got friends for all of my friends  
They ain't leaving 'till we say when  
And we gon' hangover the next day  
But we will remember this day  
So drop the pop and get low  
Or we can drop the top and just cruise  
We fresh to death, down to the shoes  
My only motto in life is don't lose  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
  
[Bridge](x2)  
We're just getting started, yeah, yeah  
We're just getting started, yeah, yeah  
Can't you see the night's still early  
And we gon' get wild and crazy  
  
[Chorus](x2)

[Lenny Harold, Nicki Minaj]  
Yeah Uh

Second to none, in crowd

Look second to none all we do is drop this,  
Six to six flow so I roll with dodges.  
And I'm in the club, everybody wanna dub  
Sip a little bub and I probally wit a thug  
Play hard to get, but I'm thinking bout it,  
So you whisper in my ear, what you thinking shawty?  
  
[Lenny Harold, verse 1]  
Hey, tryina' do withcha cause shawty cause I deal with you  
You keep me inside of those try to guess what to do next  
Should I stay or should I go  
Is difficult to love ya,  
When you don't know what you want,  
And you're left with decisions while I got cloudy visions  
You know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shawty, what you're thinking?  
You know  
What got you thinking, let go  
I know that you know, you want this love,  
You know that I know,  
You're thinking oh. (x2)

Hey, it's burning me up, just wanna get close to ya  
And you're playing games with this attraction,  
Shawty I got a it bad it's pathetic  
Oh, I just wanna understand, you're leading me for a reason

So come and take it baby  
  
[Chorus:]

Make your move

So why you're running from your feelings  
When you know how to handle it, yeah?

Na, na, nana no, na, nana, na, na, nana na.  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Stupid Wit It,  
Louis Vuitton fitted  
P Buitton kitted, fluck the critics ha.  
I'm so funny wit it, I'm just dummy wit it,  
See I already did it, tell her to come and get it.  
Who got a setup like inmirage everybody wanna get up  
In my entarouge, at this stage in the game I'm in the range  
With change, don't fuck with lames that's my claim to fame nigga.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shawty, what you're thinking?  
You know  
What are you thinking, let go  
I know that you know, you want this love,  
You know that I know,  
You're thinking oh. (x4)

[Nicki Minaj]  
I remember standing in the mirror  
Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her  
Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh  
Woah, woah  
Chasing dreams got me all over the World  
Now I'm sitting on top of the World  
We winning, we winning  
Cause we sitting on top of the World  
  
[Verse:]  
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty  
When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?  
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop  
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not  
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood  
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood  
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch  
That's when everything they write be a contradiction  
I tell em I do it for the love  
I do it for the hugs  
I do it for the buzz  
I do it for the thugs  
I do it for the rich  
I do it for the poor  
I do it for the kids that can't do no more  
  
[Nicki Minaj - Chorus]  
I remember standing in the mirror  
Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her  
Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh  
Woah, woah  
Chasing dreams got me all over the World  
Now I'm sitting on top of the World  
We winning, we winning  
Cause we sitting on top of the World  
  
[Verse 2:]  
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses  
When I'm granting they wishes they be passing they digits  
They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops  
Cuttin' school gettin knocked whether they like it or not  
They'll break in your door, might break in your jaw  
They'll bring back a lye if you bring them an O  
But what you really ain't know they airborne for stardom  
With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin'  
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sargeant  
Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em  
No heats is on 'em  
Cause grandmamma prayed that he'd leave the corner.  
  
[Nicki Minaj - Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I remember when I lost everything in a fire  
Now I got fire, 232s almost higher  
Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah  
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher  
One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block  
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops  
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides  
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like  
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun  
I see you without a man, might erase ya son  
Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder  
This goes out to everybody on the come up  
  
[Nicki Minaj - Chorus]  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Cause we sitting on top of the world  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Cause we sitting on top of the world  
We winning, winning  
  
Narcotics on the track

Uh Ayo  
Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile  
It must hurt to sell your album off Paypal  
'Specially when you in the game 15, 20  
You was hot when Shaq teamed up with Penny  
Man, you was magic!  
I mean, look at you now, hoe, you just tragic!  
You a tragedy, you a parody  
Last name Ann, first name Raaaaaaaaagedddddddddy  
These goofy bitches is stupidity personified  
Ayo, Wayne, you want it gully go to gaza side?

[Chorus]  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
  
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid  
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid  
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid  
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid  
I got a pool that I never even swam in  
Airports that you bitches never land in  
They be like what you doing Nicki?  
Brandin'  
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landin'  
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Presley  
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley  
Why these bitches so pressed, B?  
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B  
I'ma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes  
I'm the Sandro, paid on a big boat  
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat  
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won another round, Willin', get the ref  
Got the clothing line poppin' and the wigs is next  
When I fly you know G5 is the jet  
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth  
Meetings with the president of every network  
That is what the fuck I call how to network  
My net worth, that net works  
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work  
Chillin' with executives  
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive  
Trillion dollar deficit  
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit  
B-bitches ain't got punchlines or flow  
I have both and an empire also  
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo  
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low  
F-flow's sick, I-I'll slap a patient  
I'm checkin' these bitches like an application  
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation  
So it's off with your head, decapitation  
S-s-s-send 'em up in flames like a firemen  
I do the hirin' and I do the firin'  
That boss shit that you talk, I live it  
And I'm callin' a travel if you don't stay on your pivot  
Bitches  
  
[Chorus]

Just met a boy, just met a boy when  
He could come inside of my play pen  
Cause he look like a superstar in the makin'  
So I think that I'm going in for the takin'  
  
Hear through the grapevine that he cakin'  
We could shoot a movie, he could the tapin'  
Boom boom pow, this thing be shakin'  
I ain't even tryin' to find out who he datin'  
  
Cause I know that he got a wife at home  
But I need just one night alone  
If you keep playing those good ole' games  
I'm a runaway-eh, I'm a runaway-eh-eh  
  
I-I-I wanna give you one last option  
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance  
If-if you're looking for the main attraction

Just met a boy, just met a boy when  
He could become my little problem  
Cause he look like he modellin' clothes in Dublin  
So I think that he gettin' that green a goblin  
  
Heard through the grapevine that he hang low  
We could shoot a movie, could bang like Rambo  
Boom boom pow, this thing's so bingo  
Wondering if he can understand my lingo  
  
Cause I know, he got a wife at home  
But I need just one night alone  
If you keep playing those good ole' games  
I'm a runaway-eh, I'm a runaway-eh-eh  
  
I-I-I wanna give you one last option  
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance  
If-if you're looking for the main attraction  
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance  
  
If you want it, I'm gonna be

If you got it, you got it  
You got that boom boom  
  
If you want it, I'm gonna be  
Va va voom voom  
If you got it, you got it  
You got that boom boom  
  
Boy I'm in this club slow mo  
Don't mind if I do  
And I can tell you're feelin' me from the jump

Every time I end up getting to it

I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money  
One minute they hate me then they love me  
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny  
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny  
Who had Eminem on the first album?  
Who had Kanye saying "She a problem"?  
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?  
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?  
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?  
You niggas don't know it yet?  
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet  
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet  
Miss Icy, but it ain't snowing yet  
You can tell I'm the illest cause my dividend is the biggest  
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)  
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?  
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!  
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Pre-Verse]  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
(Yo, Yo)  
I'm in this bitch I'm hassadiddy

I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day  
These bitches suck, so I nick name these bitches BJ  
They want that union,they want that D. Wade  
I tell a ho "just be happy they getting leeway"  
My name Barbie, bitch (My name Barbie, bitch)  
Alexander, made me Queen  
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch  
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing  
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something  
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket  
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?  
Cash money, getting six albums  
No bitch niggas want to bitch out  
You niggas apologize and a nigga diss you?  
That's a big problem  
  
[Hook]

Why'd you have to leave in July  
On a peaceful and serene summer night  
I wish that you would have waited until September  
Just a couple more memories to remember  
  
I guess I had to pay you back to your lender  
I guess I had to send you back to The Sender  
But then again maybe you're gone till November  
And maybe this is just a part of the agenda  
  
Why'd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
Why couldn't you come right home  
When you seen the text message in your phone  
I should've put my pradas on to come and find you  
I could've told you that them niggs was behind you  
  
I couldve told you all about my intuition  
I couldve even brought the extra ammunition  
  
But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you  
Should've known from day one I couldn't trust you  
  
Why'd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
Why would they take you from me  
Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding  
If you in a better place then you free  
Well then why can't they make me believe it  
  
You said that you would leave these streets  
And I know you didn't mean in a body bag  
But now you see you not bullet proof  
And I'm mad cause you the best that I ever had  
  
Why'd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
I'll never love again

I am a monster, this is ambition  
This the type of car that you keep a bad bitch in  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition  
They want me to come and help them but I am not a magician  
I'm on them fo-fours I'm tipping, you better move out my way  
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I Win Again, Cause I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I
Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again, Yeah I Win Again  
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion isn't doubted  
Go against me, then you made a mistake  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yo, yo, cause I came out, '09 when promoters brought Wayne out  
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out  
I been bad, like cutting school, and staying out

I sat back, and watched how it was playing out  
They diss me, but running and took the same route  
Uh, but no, they not Nicki, wrist on Ice and yes my wrist Bricky  
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki, not a website booking, money, this is 50  
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy

Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty  
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy  
Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City  
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already  
(Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City  
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Soon as I came in I told them that I would become the greatest  
Muhammad Ali, these bitches, and that can't be debated

All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

So good, so real, so good, yeah

Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim  
Might breeze through the Ave, might stop at the gym  
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim  
Wa' waves on swim so they hate on him  
Anyway I think I met him sometime before  
In a different life or where I record  
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve  
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree  
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him  
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him  
And I think I love 'em, I love 'em, jus' like I raised him  
When he call me momma, lil' momma, I call him baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band  
Just left money gram in the lemon Lam'  
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam  
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland  
Anyway I think I met him in the sky  
When I was a geisha he was a samurai  
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai  
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly  
"S" on my chest lemme get my cape on  
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon  
Konvict, just like Akon  
Cause you know snitches be puttin' the Jake on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
Find me in the dark  
I'll be in the stars  
Find me in your heart  
I'm in need of your love  
Your love, your love, your love  
Baby, your the illest (illest, illest)  
Your love (love, love)  
Your love (love, love)
