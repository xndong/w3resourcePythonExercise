[Repeat: x2]  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge  
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college  
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene  
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends  
I hope things get better for you  
Cause I'ma make things get better for me  
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB  
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea  
We ride at high tide, the East is my side  
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable  
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible  
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence  
Wit persistence I perceive  
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed  
Better go around and when it come to you  
Don't bite off more than you can chew  
Respect the game and the game will respect you back  
Game is life, life is struggle  
Without the coastal juggle  
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal  
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)  
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces  
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather  
As for me I'm trying to keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Just keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
"Teatlet", hold em, shake em, roll  
Fly G boys and all you hood-rat girls  
Pound puts it down all around the world  
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga  
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark  
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?  
On the microphone I bury the bone  
Always, strays try to follow me home  
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo  
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe  
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash  
When I mob, make marks across the street  
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail  
For the bow-wow LBC style  
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper  
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever  
I want em close enough so I can lock on em  
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em  
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em  
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten,  
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?  
Major trick we're hitting licks like a doberman gang  
Why'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy  
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs  
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke  
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver  
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out  
Oh, did you not know  
Snoop wit the .44 knocking at'cha door  
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses  
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin  
It's like in a action  
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting  
Busting, no need for discussion  
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust  
Close enough to touch then rush  
Clean and radical and get clutch  
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone  
For the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Up out of there  
  
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party  
  
Pump that up G  
  
Ah shit, you done fucked up now  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
You done put two of America's  
Most wanted in the same  
Motherfucking place at the same  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Motherfucking time,  
Y'all niggas about to feel this  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Break out the champagne glasses  
And the motherfucking condoms  
Have one on us alright??  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
  
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture  
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer  
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fucking homey  
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs  
  
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run  
Now I'm back in the courtroom waiting on the outcome  
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggas mind  
But at the same time it seem they trying to take mine  
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit  
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit  
  
So now they got us laced  
Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catching cases  
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down  
Me and Snoop about to clown  
I'm "Losing My Religion", I'm vicious on these stool pigeons  
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing  
Niggas be acting like they savage, they out to get the cabbage  
I got, nothing but love, for my niggas living lavish  
  
I got a pit named P, she niggarino  
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino  
And I, think I got a black Beamer  
But my dream is to own a fly casino  
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal  
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal  
It feel good to you baby bubba  
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker  
  
Now follow as we ride  
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side  
And I can make you famous  
Niggas been dying for years, so how could they blame us  
I live in fear of a felony  
I never stop bailing these, motherfucking G's  
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant  
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nothing but a gangsta party...  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nothing but a gangsta party  
It ain't nothing but a  
Motherfucking gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nuthing but a gangsta party  
It ain't nothing but a  
Motherfucking gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
  
Now give me fifty feet  
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets  
And keep whatever's left of me  
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief  
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me  
I bust and flea, these niggas must be crazy what??  
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs  
(right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear  
Bow down in the presence of a boss player  
  
It's like cause, blood, gang banging  
Everybody in the party doing dope slanging  
You got to have papers in this world  
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swirl  
Ya doing ya job, every day  
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray  
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is  
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids  
  
They tell me not to roll with my glock  
So now I gotta throw away  
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day  
They wonder how I live, with five shots  
Niggas is hard to kill, on my block  
Schemes for currency and doe related  
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it  
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it  
My nigga dogg with me, eternally the most wanted  
  
[Chorus]

Ya oh  
I was juz told  
You get your freedom  
By telling you're enemy  
That  
You'll do anything to get you're freedom  
Then you'll get it  
Its the only way you'll get it  
When you get that kinda attitude  
Then they label you as a crazy negro  
Or they'll just call you a crazy nigga  
They dun say negro  
Or they'll call you an extremest or a subversive  
Or a sedetiast  
Or a red or a radical  
But when you stay radical long enough  
And get enough people to like you  
You'll get your freedom  
So dun run around here trying  
To to make friends with someone who will deprive you of you're rights  
There not you're friends  
No, there you're enemy's  
And treat them like that  
And fight them  
And you'll get you're freedom  
And after you get you're freedom you're enemy will respect you  
And well respect you  
And I say that with no hate  
Cause I dun have no hate in me  
I have no hate at all  
So I say to you  
Big man I'm the man you think you are  
If you want to no what ill do  
Figure out what you'll do and ill do the same only more of it

( Goldie Loc )  
Damn cause this spot's gettin hot

The closest nigga to you would do you and try to screw you  
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you  
And he could be the same nigga the switch  
Playin all one minute but he really is a bitch  
Now watch out for the twist  
Here come them niggaz that was with you but they out to get rich  
But you thought them niggaz would never do that  
Until they came back strapped with them rat-tat-tat-tats  
And it always ends up fucked up  
When the innocent die it'll have yo brain stuck  
It'll have yo brains stuck shit outta luck cause I'm havin bad luck  
Fucked up in my younger days

Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you  
( hook, Butch Cassidy )  
Another day has come  
How much longer will I run

Layin out in the sun  
How much dirt have I done  
My life has just begun

My problems weigh a ton  
( Tray-Dee )  
I gots to say damn the program dun up and switched  
Fool I used to run with and trusted snitched  
Got one time on my block straight posted  
Hopin that I slip but I dip and ghosted  
Told my babymama it wus drama unfoldin  
I kissed all my kids den commits to strollin  
Wound uptown on a hot ass block  
Checkin with some chickens gettin hot ass cock  
Daily Tray-Dee'll loose pursuit  
But deez ho's broke and don't look to cute  
So I parlay to the hard ways of jackin  
Fast came to cash but the mash was crackin  
I didn't I was the one to be  
Kickin summary of sum wen I let em slide up under me  
But God as my witness  
As a G I couldn't see Dee just goin out sensless  
I stayed hard hit the yard  
Pull niggaz hole cards

Jail house scars tell the part you played  
Livin with a snitch jackin destined for the brake  
It don't pay to go soft  
Cause when we catch you slippin real niggas takin off motherfuckers  
( Dee, Talkin )

Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky  
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999  
Shit out of control, sign of the times  
I ain't had this much fun since '79  
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the pen  
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing  
Playing football up in Powly High  
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside  
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rapping much  
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strapping up  
Hell motherfucking yeah, nigga wanna see the end  
So next year we can do it all again  
Same dogg channel, same dogg time  
Only the strong will survive in 99  
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing  
Dripping on my memories, twisted off my music  
Trying to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it  
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it  
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising  
And East-side niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)  
But them West-side niggas is the craziest (craziest)  
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine  
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime  
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime  
Be smart, fresh start is all you need  
First thing first, cause, stop smoking cess weed  
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating  
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating  
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say  
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead  
And Betty said Eddie's a fed  
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head  
And he fucking with this hood-rat that he met up in dance  
Betty getting mad cause Eddie wanna share  
But look at how you living for a minute then compare  
I love confetti, I always stay ready  
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli  
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now  
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow  
Two down, with just one gun  
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun  
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone  
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone  
Tragically casualties and fatalities  
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me  
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said  
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead  
I never really understood what he said  
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head  
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson  
Slow down and go down, shit you know now  
  
Be smart, fresh start is all you need  
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed  
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating  
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating  
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say  
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way  
  
(Somehow someway)  
You got to make a better way  
(You got to make a better way)  
You got to make a better way  
(You got to make a better way)  
You got to make a better way  
(You got to make a better way)  
You got to make a better way  
(Yeah, better days ahead)  
Better days ahead  
(Better days ahead)  
Better days ahead  
  
That's real.  
I feel your pain nigga.  
I used to be just like you nigga.  
Before I got off in this rap shit.  
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.  
You know, but one thing I never did do.  
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.  
I went out and got my own ya feel me?  
So from me to you, man to man.  
Better days ahead my nigga.  
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.  
Cause I'm a get mine regardless.  
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets.  
I gotta have it.

Hangin' out all in front of my home  
  
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own  
Now it's really on

Put that switches on his riches

See that's the plan I was brainwashed not to know  
  
But nigga fuck what you goin' through this 2-0  
And by that time I'm 17 if I ain't in that pin

Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll?  
You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?  
Well girl I like the way you roll  
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains  
Not talking 'bout the view  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
So if you wanna go to Melrose  
Let's hit Adidas, cause girl we got our own shell toes  
And then we'll go to Venice  
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it  
For like 15 minutes  
Girl, you never gon' forget it  
And if you wanna go around town  
I could show you where all the real get it  
And if you wanna go downtown  
You might as well roll with a real nigga  
I'm not talking 'bout them fools  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]  
And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll?

Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you

I could show you where all the real get it  
And if you wanna go downtown  
You might as well roll with a real nigga  
I'm not talking bout them fools

[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family  
Fighting these precious in my life  
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammy's  
But these streets won't say a goodbye  
  
I can't say goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the hood goodbye  
To the streets (to my problems)  
  
I can't say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
I can't say goodbye goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
Goodbye  
To the hood  
I can't say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the homies  
  
[Verse 1]  
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy  
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy  
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy  
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,  
Let them do them take care of your own boy"  
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy  
You had dreams of being a dope boy  
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po  
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'  
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,  
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first  
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church  
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st  
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse  
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me,  
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me  
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,  
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,  
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted  
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they
owe me  
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops  
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man  
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not  
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot,
man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Thank good every day that the boy could spit  
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit  
I know I got plenty more wars to get  
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids  
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit  
They made me how I am, the music in the man  
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn  
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan  
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand  
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man  
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand  
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans  
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins  
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids  
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name  
Would live... In the streets  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just can't say goodbye  
  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
You can take the man out the streets,  
But you can't take the streets out the man

"Black folks can't never have no fun!"  
  
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]  
These streets be walking down the avenue  
(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!  
These streets be, crazy!  
Long Beach to Compton!  
Always up to no good! Cra  
(Crazy!) Crazy  
Always up to no good!  
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy  
(Crazy!)  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Have a look outside and take a stroll with me  
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?  
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be  
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me  
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me  
I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G  
At your local liquor store, getting some optimums  
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'  
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast  
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost  
A-humph, yeah, I love my folks  
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats  
On the real no, the streets'll have you  
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile  
Yeah, see you gradually grow  
And when you walking on my side I think you all need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block  
In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop  
Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared  
Young pimp on the grind trying to line up some head  
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run  
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young  
Seesaw we raw like oh-la-la  
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do  
Yeah nigga we shaking the cops  
You niggas out there just be making it hot  
But don't trip if you faking a lot

Back with some shit that gots to bump  
As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk  
Just to floss you like a motherfucker, clownin' their shit  
Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch  
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe  
If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper

With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack  
So Daz, step up on the ass  
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past  
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote  
With my nigga D-are-E, so you know I must be dope  
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass  
Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK  
That I bring as I slang like cavy  
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy  
Had he not known about the city I'm from  
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back  
Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit  
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood  
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up  
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling  
But did you raise up all this nuts?  
Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up  
  
Chiggie check, microphone check one,  
Chiggie check, microphone check two,  
Chiggie check, microphone check three  
  
You tuned to the sounds of the D-are-E,  
Now check me out, it's back to the old school  
Where the niggas get their strap on, don't nobody cap on  
Slap on some D-are-E  
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double G-Y-D-O-double G  
Real G's who drop K's, protect these N-you-T, so nigga please  
Peep out my manuscript  
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit

Tonight's the night I get in some shit [Yeah]  
Deep cover on the incognito tip.  
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to  
Peelin' caps too cause you niggas know I'm comin' at you.  
I guess that's part of the game  
But I feel for the nigger who thinks he just gonna come and chance  
Things  
With the swiftness so get it right with the quickness  
And let me handle my business yo.  
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop  
Until I get the nigger maxin' at the top.  
I hope you get his ass before he drops.  
Kingpin kickin' back while his workers sling his rocks.  
Coming up like a fat rat.  
Big money, big cars, big body guards on his back.  
So it's difficult to get him.  
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact  
With  
Him.  
Hit him like this and like that,  
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack  
What is this pen? so let's rush it.  
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it  
On the nigga's time, in the nigga's place,  
Take a strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face.  
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker,  
But I gives a fuck, cause I'm going deep cover.  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood,  
Maniac, lunatic, call 'em Snoop Eastwood  
Kickin' dust as I bust fuck peace  
And, the mothafuckin' drug police  
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop  
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop  
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do  
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue  
Dre, (whatup, Snoop) yo I got the feelin'  
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'  
Killin', feelin', no remorse, yeah  
So lets go straight to the motherfuckin' source  
And see what we can find  
Crooked ass cops that be gettin niggaz a gang of times  
And now they want to make a deal with me  
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me  
And make my pockets bigger  
They want to meet with me tonight at 7:00, so whassup nigger?  
What you want to do? (What you want to do?)

So if you want to blast, nigga we can buck 'em  
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!"  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Six fo' five was the time on the clock,  
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot.  
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up  
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up.  
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed.  
I'm checkin for the gats they strap, so what's up black?  
Chill, lets hit a deal, if it ain't up to what you feel then grab your  
Steel.  
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?  
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip.  
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me?  
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey,  
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush,  
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us."  
Hmmm, let me think about it  
Turned my back and grabbed my gat and guess what I told him before I  
Shot  
It:  
'If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah, I'm lettin' my gat  
Pop'  
Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop  
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop

10-20-71, the day I come out  
Two days later, I'm running my mouth  
Mom's put a bottle to my grill  
I look her in the face and I say chill  
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh  
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital  
On my way to the liquor store  
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0  
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold  
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll  
But before I get out the door  
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo  
He picks me up and sit me on the seat  
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police  
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet  
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet  
First trip in the police car  
Cameras all around me as if I was a star  
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me  
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)  
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and  
That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'  
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'  
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'  
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's  
Twenty days later I'm from are-T-see  
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up  
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck  
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up  
Havin' fun and stuff  
You niggas don't want none of us  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
What's up homie (What's up 'cause, where you from)  
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)  
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)  
(Oh) yeah (OK, it's all good cuz) That's what I'm talkin' bout  
(Yeah) Ah, you gonna feel me nigga, sooner or later  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P  
Mel-man where ya been O.G.  
Tell me, the game'll never fail me  
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby  
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby  
This is the dopest G, that you will ever see  
There'll never be, another me  
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me  
Pause, do it to em' dogg  
Now drop a rock em' dogg  
Now put a lock em' dogg  
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log  
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho  
Get me a Michelob, now I want to Snicker though  
Remind me of the old days  
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays  
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style  
Mel-Man you a fool for this 'cause  
Cause I'm the motherfucking dogg, named Snoop

I put down more hits than mafioso made  
And Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano  
And I know, I know the way you feel  
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real  
  
Just to get you caught up in amazement  
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous  
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack  
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha  
  
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan  
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo,  
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes  
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's  
  
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga  
I'm Tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)  
  
Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)  
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)  
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance  
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance  
  
I'm so fly like a dove  
I come from up above  
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love  
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em  
  
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom  
I delete em, but don't mistreat em  
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on,  
Let me flow on  
  
You can rock to tha rythme you see  
or you can rock to tha rythme of me  
Just remember when you do your thang,  
Make sure you do your thang on a hang  
  
And everythang, is everythang  
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase  
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case  
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,  
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost  
I'm Tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, do anybody in tha house remember  
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)  
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC  
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)  
  
Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop  
Have prestigious women  
That's the truth from the beginning  
In and out of the flyest hotels  
  
You say your family don't know me  
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos  
Sales, tails, scales and jails  
Success before death  
  
No one in my clique fails  
As females with the almighty Father lead  
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need  
And it ain't no party like this kind,  
  
'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind  
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind  
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and  
I'm tha DoggFather  
  
[Chorus until fade]

[Chorus]  
Come and go with me to Doggyland!  
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)  
To a place that be, call it LBC  
(I'm ridin' with ya baby)  
Come and go with me to Doggyland!  
To a place that be, call it LBC  
  
Now if you tired of the hard work  
Tears and sweat  
And you breakin' your neck  
And you still up in debt.  
Walkin' round town all strapped in,  
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.  
Two strikes none left, out of breath  
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.  
All this deception on top of stress,  
You havin' more problems than a algebra test.  
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,  
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.  
It's a thin line, between yours and mine  
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.  
Now I know a place where  
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh your homies think you're funny?  
Doin' stick ups for moneys  
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)  
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,  
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.  
You all about yo' money and got something to sell  
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.  
You chillin' with yo' feet up  
Someone hated but baby without the homies and  
That's when you got beat up.  
Because you can't be out there doin' low  
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll.  
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,  
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.  
But see, I know a place where  
You might wanna be  
And I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.  
To a place that be, call it LBC.  
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)  
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
Cause he travelin' in the fast lane.  
  
Stop the life it seem that we are on,  
Time to slow your roll,  
Let Doggyland be your new home,  
Stop the life it seem that we are on,  
Time to slow your roll,  
Let Doggyland be your new home.  
  
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne  
(It's goin' down)  
Everything is free,  
And ain't no HIV. (What?)  
And niggas don't kill one another  
(Oh really why is that?)  
Because a brother is a brother.  
(And what about the mothers?)  
They queens,  
Righteous,  
Man,  
Heaven must be like this,  
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime.  
Ain't no penitentiaries and ain't nobody doin' time.  
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,  
I'm smarter than the senator,  
Bigger than the mayor.  
Heaven on Earth  
It's like a prayer.  
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got  
To be a player.  
Now you know a place where  
You gots to be and I took you there,  
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.  
  
[Chorus]

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, Quik check this out dog  
You know motherfuckers be doing way way too motherfucking much  
You know? That's real  
Just like baby right here, she doing too much  
  
Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car  
And he acting like it's his but you know it's not  
Say he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up  
She acting like that hair's hers but you know what's up  
Say she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much  
  
I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb  
I told em "Hit the side and slide and get the herb"  
But guess who's calling, Pipedream Patty  
Made that nigga park my who ride beside the alley  
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)  
Fuck that nigga yo  
But I can't forget about him cause he taught me everything I know  
Oh no Joe, walking down the wrong lane  
Tooting on that cocaine, fucking wit that wrong thing  
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)  
Then fake the funk, doggonnit  
Now loc, look at this predicament  
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit  
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew  
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to  
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew  
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce  
  
Now if you're doing for your family and you can't stand it  
Cause you know these motherfuckers trying take advantage  
Say they doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope  
And he need to catch a motherfucking different stroke  
Say he doing too much, yeah Joey you doing too much  
  
We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style  
We might throw a pool party every once in a while  
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend  
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in  
I believe in, sharing the cock  
Also, I believe in comparing the cock  
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)  
Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy  
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep  
When she went down on me  
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off  
Oh wee, baby you's a freak  
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta  
But my homey fell in love and he banked her  
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist  
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist  
  
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back  
And he get his third strike wit no get back  
Say he doing too much, yeah homey you doing too much  
And when the homey in the pen, doing a sin  
And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend  
Say she doing too much, hell yeah she doing too much  
  
I'm living up in the hills, wine sipping wit mills  
I'm having major type of paper, I ain't tripping off bills (still)  
Show me some respect and accept my coolness  
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish  
Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting  
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin  
Pardon me, cause I ain't mad when you get bent  
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. spray  
Friends and family, getting after me like repo  
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note  
You doing too much when you clutching on my touch-tone  
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone  
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power  
And only get to hit a cold shower  
You faking like you're making more moves than Simpson  
But fronting, pushing buttons, doing nothing but sin  
  
And when a nigga on yo' phone, running up yo' bill  
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel  
You know he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much  
And when your baby momma crying bout she need some milk  
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt  
You know she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much  
That's real

[snoop dogg]  
Yo dogg, niggas always asking me  
"is the muthafuckin dpgc still together? "  
Niggas gon ask me  
"dogg y'all still together, I heard y'all broke up like the fat boys."

Now what the fuck made you think the dp divided  
Moving on up to the top of the map  
Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback  
I'm moving down to block d, me and my homies  
The dogg pound would rock overseas, immense degrees  
No bitch niggas in the circle  
Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple  
[daz dillinger]  
I told myself watch out for my family and health  
I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf  
Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools  
Old school poda dada that I knew from way back to school  
Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty  
Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up  
What up  
[snoop dogg]  
Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, dogg pound, ya heard  
If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who  
To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue  
You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that  
Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback  
The d, the p, the g to see  
Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me  
See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit  
Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick  
Chorus  
Don't be foolish x2

[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]  
Ma! I think it's safe to say  
You ain't seen a playa lay this way  
Or playa game this way  
Wit a attitude, like - and ya don't stop  
Aficionado, so fashionable  
Wit a confident swagger, international  
Game so tight the girls had to go  
And you don't stop!  
  
[Verse - Beanie Sigel]  
Hah! sicka than your average  
Money too long can't stash it  
In the closet or the mattress  
Paper, stretch like elastic  
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it  
So the price for that, never ask it  
Just sign my name or pop plastic  
Hating ass cops wanna harrass em  
Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion  
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses  
And they left breast (yes!)  
Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion  
Cops couldn't page em, flow so amazing, hot like cajun  
You fucking wit the champ  
Pop corks on champ' like I just took the chip  
Nigga took the stand when he coulda took the 5th  
Yeah eat a dick wit AIDs on the tip, keep my name off ya lips  
Not guilty!  
  
[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]  
Ma! I think it's safe to say  
You ain't seen a playa lay this way  
Or playa game this way  
Wit a attitude, like - and ya don't stop  
Aficionado, so fashionable  
Wit a confident swagger, international  
Game so tight the girls had to go  
And you don't stop!  
  
[Verse - Beanie Sigel]  
I said I'm sicka than your average  
Keep three shooters like the Mavericks  
Short to the point like Nash is, fucking wit a savage  
Niggaz press they luck, get bucked like ashes  
Three piece suits, linen fabrics  
Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor  
B Sig bring the light to the masses  
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes  
One shooting can lead to three caskets  
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings  
You softer than a Reebok Classic  
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges  
I was taught stay low and keep blasting  
Po only know questions that was answered  
Keep a number on the high price lawyer  
It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya  
  
[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]  
Ma! I think it's safe to say  
You ain't seen a playa lay this way  
Or playa game this way  
Wit a attitude, like - and ya don't stop  
Aficionado, so fashionable  
Wit a confident swagger, international  
Game so tight the girls had to go  
And you don't stop!  
  
[Bridge - repeat 2x]  
[SD] Now let's toast to the man, that when he get out  
That he gon do them thangs that he rap about  
A true playa Pha-real [Pharrell]  
[BS] Haters stay out my face  
And know that thing still by my waist  
  
[Verse - Beanie Sigel]  
Once again I'm sicker then 'em all  
Niggaz see C's start shitting in they drawers  
When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying  
Wipe the piss off the floor  
The ape is back, my gate is cracked  
My jumpsuit and my cuffs is off  
Yeah I'm back on them bricks  
Raise your cups and raise your glass  
And let's toast to the boy B Mack, yeah I'm back in the mix!  
  
[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]  
Ma! I think it's safe to say  
You ain't seen a playa lay this way  
Or playa game this way  
Wit a attitude, like - and ya don't stop  
Aficionado, so fashionable  
Wit a confident swagger, international  
Game so tight the girls had to go  
And you don't stop  

LA, Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Highway  
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali  
Don't go 'less you go hard  
Go 'less you go hard  
  
Hollywood, downtime and back  
Life is always good  
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood  
You knew that it never would  
Knew that it never would  
  
Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings, Angels, Clippers  
Real set trippers, clarify ride, we bonafide dippers  
ESPN, you know Sports Centre  
Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet,  
Home of the NBA championship  
Purple and gold, homie let the story be told  
It's the city where you shoot your favorite television episode  
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard  
But you gotta have a low-rider car  
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'  
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon  
That's how we represent it though  
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64, yeah I love showing it out  
First things first my nig', you better know where you at  
You in

Life is always good  
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood  
You knew that it never would  
You knew that it never would  
  
Riding on the 405  
On my way to pick up baby  
85 in the winter time  
Man, this place is crazy  
I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it  
Summer time in Cali  
  
Rollin' down Fairfax  
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico  
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes  
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues  
About 9 o'clock stop by the record shop  
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball  
Life is a mystery, my life is like history  
Stop by my dispensary, give me some kush and pusha  
Put it in the trunk, smelling like a skunk  
But it's all legal in LA, everybody taking a hit  
From the politicians, athletes and even the teachers  
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher  
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"  
Yeah, I love showing you that  
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at  
You in

These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
  
I met this girl her name was Joan  
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone  
When I met Joan I took her home  
She was just like a doggie all on my bone  
  
I met another girl her name was Ann  
All she wanted was to freak with a man  
When I met Ann, I shook her hand  
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can  
  
The next young freak, I met was Red  
I took her to my house and she gave me head  
She like blowin' dicks, is all she said  
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed  
  
There's another girl, her name is Sherry  
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary  
I heard she was freakin' from my big brother Jerry  
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry  
  
Young and tender, sweet Denise  
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast  
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece  
She'll only start talkin' bout signin' a lease  
  
I met a young tender, her name is Lori  
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story  
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa  
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser  
  
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle  
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale  
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well  
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell  
  
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi  
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was 'flantly'  
She had a best friend, her name was Janet  
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game  
  
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan  
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam  
The very next day, I saw her with her man  
One week passed, and I was in her again  
  
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine  
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen  
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend  
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans  
  
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy  
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me  
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta  
A country broad from Alabama  
  
I met this freak, her name was Beth  
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death  
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin' sweat  
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath  
  
Bake, and, shake, ups  
I met this freak in Vegas  
She she said her name was Don-na  
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na  
  
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo  
I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe  
You can break yourself, but you can't break me  
You never met a player like Snoop baby"  
  
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe  
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'  
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'  
She was down on her knees, beggin' to blow  
  
She's like another freak, named Renee  
You get her all alone and she'll make your day  
Like Burger King, she knows the play  
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way  
  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well!

Life is much mo' precious  
Than you'll think  
Like a game'll make yo chips sink  
It's so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face  
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place  
Keep my head up and stand tall  
If I stumble, then I'll fall  
Will you pick me up at all?  
Will you pick me up at all?  
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end  
Cause some people do pretend  
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends  
That we can call friends  
Ohhhhhhh  
  
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up  
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind  
But I'm kind-hearted  
And don't like being stepped on  
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position  
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say  
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day  
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody  
But you know what I never do?  
Smoke it off like Gotti  
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones  
Tray Deee and Snoop, we sound good on this microphone  
I never threaten nobody to make it happen  
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'  
But if I had a chance to give it back  
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that  
Do that, straight from the heart  
Eastside till I die  
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life  
  
It's a trip how we Crip  
Suppose the enemies still  
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears  
Insane's and twenties both from the same city  
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many  
Me, see, and the G can think back to the start  
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park  
And having a heart  
To get 'em up if it was beef  
Head up like G's, take it out in the street  
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view  
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few  
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case  
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase  
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke  
A Insane with a twenty, now we hell of a close  
And why'all kids, my kids, so we family now  
Cause I could never see you doing bad without  
And that's real  
  
Life is much mo' precious  
Than you'll think  
Like a game'll make yo chips sink  
It's so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face  
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place  
Keep my head up and stand tall  
If I stumble, then I'll fall  
Will you pick me up at all?  
Will you pick me up at all?  
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end  
Cause some people do pretend  
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends  
That we can call friends

[Snoop]  
Get on up to get down

You want a problem, then lets go  
Cause if not I came to disco  
And freak this ho from Acopoqo  
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride  
Let's go we hit the hood slow  
Post up, set up shop and press four  
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough  
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know  
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke  
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast  
In the summertime  
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion  
Nigga watch how I handle mine  
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this  
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless  
Square biz, you know what time it is

Fa shizzle dizzle, its the big Neptizzle  
With the Snoopy D-O-Double Jizzle!  
(Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
Yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
  
Bam, boom, what you gone do cous'?  
Guess I'm rolling in with them baby blue chucks  
And I still got my khakis creased  
I'm still rocking on these beats, and got a bad rep on the streets  
Its the S-N-double-O-P, and, biggest dogg of 'em all  
And you's a flea, and  
And since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must  
And give it to you mother fuckers like bust-a-bust  
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust  
And cant none of y'all, fuck wit us  
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinking wisely  
These pullas are contagious, just like Ron Isley  
(What the hell is going on? Someone's sleeping in my home)  
Snoop to the D-O-Double G  
Get in, where you fit in, follow me  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
Who kick the khakis from his pants? (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
Get the dro' low anything will stand (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
Still rock the gin n juice in hand (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)  
  
I do it for the G's, and I do it for the hustlaz  
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters  
Fuck the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us  
The one nigga is chilly, as if his name was Usher  
But I'm still riding in macks, making 'em G stacks  
And got them corn rows to the back  
I ain't really trying to be picky  
But if you give me somethin, its got to be the sticky  
Doing by the ounces, Lo' lo's bouncing  
Ninety doing faking with kissing on the couching  
Boo to the ouchin', more a fountain  
But that's how we get another doggy dogg housing  
This year we ain't fuck with thousands  
We clean with millions and we fly as a falcon  
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg Pound, with a car fulla bitches  
Fuckin grits like Alice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)  
Yeah they running on the side!  
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)  
Yeah they running on the side!  
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)  
Yeah they running on the side!  
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)  
Yeah they running on the side!  
Take two and pass it, it will not burn you  
From the Long Beach chronicles to the Wall Street Journal  
They all know the G with the cut in his coupe  
Ask Bill Gates (yeah I know the homie Snoop)  
Yeah I'm still loaded, hanging with my folk and  
Follow Rakim cause "I Ain't No Joke"

Yo' whats up, whats up.  
(Could you read us a bedtime story?)  
Alright, alright.  
Y'all get my ash tray, get my lighter.  
I'm a read y'all a gangsta bedtime story.  
Come here, sit on my lap.  
(Okay.)  
Check it out.  
  
Great scotts, it's hot today  
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest  
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air  
His vision getting blurry but you know I didn't care  
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck  
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck  
Shooting like a motherfucking Vietnam vet  
Riding on this nigga disrespecting my set  
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots  
On the hood getting hot, anybody can drop  
You better have a spot up in town my nigga  
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga  
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat  
Grease strikes you out with no get back  
Wishing for a steak eating on a Kit Kat  
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that  
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me  
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me  
We can ride on some niggas for nothing at all  
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em  
LBC in this motherfucker cause  
I had to show these niggas what time it was  
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns  
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves  
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip  
Or better yet, strapped a clip  
To a motherfucking' nine millimeter for heater  
And put the ride down out of G two seater  
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that  
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that  
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back  
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack  
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack  
I brought the curl back and the golf hat  
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps  
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks  
I brought snaps to the game nigga  
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga  
S-N double O-P fa sho  
I do my thang way cut throat on the down-low  
Oh once upon a time in the LBC  
There lived a OG from the DPG  
And all the little kids looked up to him  
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him  
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel  
And all they hated on him because he was way to real  
I don't know why but he's just so fly  
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight

I'm not down with the republic party or the democratic party  
I represent the gangsta party  
The gangsta party, yes sir

When the po-lice get after, we dippin' on three wheels  
Cup filled to the rim feather in my brim, headed to a party in the LBC

When me and my homeboys step into the house  
All the bitch ass niggas start breakin' out cause you know

So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts  
Like her but she keep cryin', I got a boyfriend, bitch stop lyin'  
Punk ass hooker ain't nuthin' but a dyke,

And sometimes I gotta bust a nut, and sometimes I won't  
Check it, from the crips to the bloods to the niggas sellin' drugs  
Yet niggas pimp hoes in the mother fucking clubs

The nigga that'll hang ya, the ship that'll sink ya  
And the bullet that'll bang ya  
I'm the hour in a clock, I'm the high on the rock

If we didn't have a place to go would you still be

Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys  
It's 19-9-tre so let me just play  
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre  
But this time I'ma hit yo' ass with a touch  
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up  
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked  
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack  
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checking  
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearing on the record  
It's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P  
D-O-double-G-why, the D-O-double-G  
I'm fly as a falcon, soaring through the sky  
And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide  
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy  
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie  
I'm crazy, you can't phase me  
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress  
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see  
Every single day, chilling with the D-O-double-G's  
P-O-you-N-D that's my clique, my crew  
Ya fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up  
I thought ya knew, but yet and still  
Ya want to get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill  
And feel, the motherfucking realism  
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic I'm hitting hard as steel nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How many hoes in your motherfucking group  
Want to take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille  
Chill, as I take you on a trip  
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side  
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at  
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back  
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me  
But you know how that goes  
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row  
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it  
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip  
Still clocking grip, and really don't give a shit  
About nothing at all, just my Doggs, stepping through the fog  
And I'm still gonna fade em all  
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hanging  
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be banging?  
Every single one, to get the job done  
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one  
Where the sun be shining and I be ryhming  
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I come creeping through the fog with my sagging Dukes  
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille  
I'm rolling with the G Funk, bumping in my shit and it don't quit  
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set  
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit  
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfucking dick  
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip  
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this  
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff  
And keep the motherfucking blunt in your pocket loc  
'cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke  
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from  
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some  
But watch the gun by my side  
Because it represents me and the motherfucking East Side  
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow  
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow  
My shit is dope, original, now you know  
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow  
  
[Chorus]

A brother sayin hi to you (say it)  
I really wouldn't lie to you  
I want to get inside of you  
Inside of you, what you try to do (can I hit it)  
A brother sayin hi to you (wish me luck)  
I really wouldn't lie to you (yea)  
I want to be inside of you (fo real)  
And after I do, goodbye to you  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Watch my floors fo' sho', hock up the kitchen  
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes  
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious  
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them chickens was vicious  
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the eye  
Oops, slid it on the accident  
But, when I first met her she was so ???  
So it made no sense why she did that for the hell of it  
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg  
And I met her at the mall  
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you  
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you  
Make you want to come back and get another piece  
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece  
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket  
Ride it, divide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it  
  
[Chorus:]  
A brother sayin hi to you  
I want to be inside of you  
I know I'm lookin fly to you  
I wouldn't lie to you, what'cha tryna do  
A brother sayin hi to you  
You know I wouldn't lie to you  
I want to be inside of you  
And after I do, goodbye to you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl  
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world  
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools  
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish  
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list  
Unless you want to be the girl that fill that void-acap

Look here, my boo'll be through  
So you gotta raise, boy game pays  
On the next phase, gotta show to do at 4  
Then I'm headed right back to the studio  
If you need the hook up  
Give a nigga a holla  
I slide through your hood, in the gold impala  
Drop off a sack, then I head right back  
And I hope I don't get jacked, cause you know I'm ridin' strapped  
But if the boys decide to pull me over loc  
They recognize my face, and so they go  
Gangsta's get respect ya see  
All y'all other niggaz gettin' shook like fleas
