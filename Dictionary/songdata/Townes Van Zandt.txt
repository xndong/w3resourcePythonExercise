Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine  
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine  
That's got you to feeling this way, but I don't care,  
I want you to stay  
And hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
  
Children are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all  
The window's accusing the door of abusing the wall  
But who cares what the night watchmen say  
The stage has been set for the play  
Hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
  
The moon's come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky  
The wind's runnin' free but it ain't up to me ask why  
The poets are demanding their pay  
They've left me with nothin' to say  
'Cept hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
Just hold me and tell me that you'll be here to love me today

My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I had me a mother that could pray, boys  
She prayed for me both night and day, boys  
And I tore down every down every prayer that she could say, boys  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I want to find me a lady fair and tender  
Want to play her song on my steel strings  
Gonna lay her down in a bed of clover  
Then I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I've seen this whole wide country over  
From New York city down to Mexico  
And I've seen the joyful and the sorrow  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
So Mister [Sinby] can you hear me  
Down there in [Gracel], Louisana-O  
I'll lay a joint upon your grave, Sir  
Then I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore

Blue wind's blown my dreams away  
My darling's flown and she's gone to stay  
All I got now is yesterday  
And I don't know what to do  
  
I guess I'll go downtown and see  
Just what downtown can do for me  
Maybe set my lonesome free  
Or maybe let me go  
  
I loved her true and I told her so  
I ask her too and she told me no  
She said she had somewhere to go  
And then she said good-bye  
  
I wonder how long it can go on  
How long I'll sing this same old song  
I wonder which one done us wrong  
Which one forgot to try  
  
I loved her true and I told her so  
I ask her too and she told me no  
She said she had somewhere to go  
And then she said good-bye

I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
You know she cools me with her breathin'  
Chases away those howlin' bottles of wine  
  
She fits just like my guitar  
Man, she's near as tall as me  
She fits just like my guitar  
She's near as tall as me  
She lives way out the D train  
But she's Texas as can be  
  
She got a home-spun disposition  
Man, she's just as gentle as you please  
She got a home-spun disposition  
Man, she's just as gentle as you please  
She got arms just like two rattle snakes  
Legs just like a billow in the breeze  
  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I got a brand new companion  
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time  
I want to trace her with my body  
I want to track her with my mind

Brother Flower, are you listenin'?  
Let me sing a song for you  
Brother Flower, petals glistenin',  
In the bashful mornings dew  
Brother Flower, when the sun shines  
And the dew has flown away  
If you don't mind weak and wrong rhymes  
Brother Flower, may I stay?  
  
Brother Flower, you ain't lonely  
For you've always been alone  
But I haven't been so lucky  
I had love and now it's gone  
I have arms to hold another  
Never to hold her again  
I have life to give lover  
You have life to give the wind  
  
Brother Flower, when the snow flies  
And you lay your beauty down  
Brother Flower, are you sleepin'  
There upon the cold, cold ground  
Brother Flower, please awaken  
Show the sky your face of blue  
Let me know I ain't forsaken  
Seems like all I have is you

I heard her sing in tongues of silver  
I heard her cry on a summer storm  
I loved her, but she did not know it  
So I don't think about her anymore  
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it  
So I don't think about her anymore  
  
If three and four was seven only  
Where would that leave one and two?  
If love can be and still be lonely  
Where does that leave me and you?  
Time there was, and time there will be  
Where does that leave me and you?  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
I'd tame him down and ride away.  
If I had a flyin' schooner  
I'd sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day  
  
Pretty songs and pretty places  
Places that I've never seen  
Pretty songs and pretty faces  
Tell me what their laughter means  
Some look like they'll cry forever  
Tell me what their laughter means.  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
I'd tame him down and ride away.  
If I had a golden galleon  
I'd sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day

I'm goin' out to Denver  
See if I can't find  
I'm goin' out to Denver  
See if I can't find  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine  
  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
She bring the sun to shining  
Tell the rain to fall  
  
It's been a long time, mama,  
Since I heard you call my name  
Ah, been a long time  
Since I heard you call my name  
I got to see my Colorado girl again  
  
Be there tomorrow  
Mama, don't you cry  
Be there tomorrow  
Now, mama, don't you cry  
I got to kiss these  
Lonesome Texas blues good-bye  
  
I'm goin' out to to Denver  
See if I can't find  
I'm goin' out to to Denver  
See if I can't find  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine

Tossin' hair a-ravin'  
Eyes of flashin' blue  
All the livin' that you're savin'  
Won't buy you dreams for you  
  
Cut yourself a columbine  
Tear it from the stem  
Now breathe upon the petals fine  
And throw them to the wind  
  
Watch the petals dancin'  
See them twirl and sing  
All your pride and prancin'  
How much does it mean?  
  
Watch the petals start to fly  
And then come falling down  
Hear the wind begin to cry  
As she sees some touch the ground  
  
Ah, lady, like the flower fair  
Some day you'll have to fall  
And you can find me standin' there  
To catch you if you crawl  
  
Tossin' hair a-ravin'  
Eyes of flashin' blue  
All the livin' that you're savin'  
Won't buy you dreams for you

Could it be the season's changin'  
The winds of winter rearranging  
All the leaves like fallin' queens of sorrow  
Could be the freezing rain a-fallin'  
Could be sad September callin'  
Or maybe its knowin' she'll be gone  
Come tomorrow  
  
Well, it's strange how many tortured mornings  
Fell upon us with no warning  
Lookin' for a smile to beg and borrow  
It's over now, there is no returning  
A thousand bridges sadly burning  
And light the way I have to walk alone  
Come tomorrow  
  
I guess that no amount of lying  
To myself will stop the crying  
I guess I have to take things like they are  
The facts are plain to see, it's only  
That I ain't used to being lonely  
Like I'm gonna be without you  
Come tomorrow  
  
Come tomorrow

Baby hit the back door breathin' real heavy  
Said the boys in the alley wouldn't leave her alone  
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry  
She finally got ready but the boys were gone  
Mama don't you worry, night's aproachin'  
There's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through  
Close your eyes and dream real steady  
Maybe just a little will spill on you  
  
The dark don't lie  
And dreams come true  
Could be a few will see you through  
  
Old lady Rose, lookin' down her nose  
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall  
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over  
Rosy's just waitin' for the ax to fall  
Show me off on the way to town  
The sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown  
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases  
Gonna dance in their faces  
When the guitar sounds  
  
It won't be long  
I won't be gone  
I've been leaning toward the shadows all along  
  
Those in the know say how it goes  
You plan on reapin' you better sow  
You plan on sleepin' you better keep movin'  
Sleepin' ain't allowed around here you know  
Tell me please when the rollin's over  
Me and my baby gonna have some fun  
Bury our backs in a bed of clover  
Smile in style while the sun goes down  
  
Snake eyes cry  
And boxcars sigh  
Seven's stuck in the middle just wonderin' why  
  
The dark don't lie  
And dreams come true  
All it takes is one or two  
Maybe just a few will see you through  
Maybe just a few will see you through

Well, when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talkin' to some rich folks that you know  
Well, I hope you don't see me in my ragged company  
Well, you know I could never be alone  
  
Take me down, little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
Send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Well, when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Days  
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon  
And another girl to take my pain away  
  
Take me down, little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
Send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Take me down, little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
Send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Say it with dead flowers in my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
that I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile  
  
Well, if you're blue don't cry  
Just wander right downtown  
You can find your delta mama waitin' there  
Well, I thought you knew that I  
Would never let you down  
I can ease your mind and take away your cares  
  
Come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
That I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile  
  
Well, if the grass goes brown  
Don't you hang your head too low  
Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine  
If you'll just ask around  
I'm sure someone will know  
Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feelin' fine  
  
Well, if you don't know by now  
What I've been tryin' so hard to say  
Well my delta boy I'm afraid you're up to tight  
But you take it slow and somehow  
You come meandering out my way  
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right  
  
Ah, come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
That I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

If I had a dollar bill  
Yes, I believe I surely will  
Go to town and drink my fill  
Early in the morning  
  
Little darling, she's a red haired thing  
Man, she makes my legs to sing  
Gonna buy her a diamond ring  
Early in the morning  
  
Mother was a golden girl  
I slit her throat just to get her pearls  
Cast myself into a whirl  
Before a bunch of swine  
  
It's a long way down the Harlan road  
Busted back and a heavy load  
Won't get through to save my soul  
Early in the morning  
  
I've always been a gambling man  
I've rolled them bones with either hand  
Seven is the promised land  
Early in the morning  
  
Whiskey'd be my dying bed  
Tell me where to lay my head  
Not with me is all she said  
Early in the morning  
  
If I had a dollar bill  
Yes, I believe I surely will  
Go to town and drink my fill  
Early in the morning

Now, me and this friend named, Streetlife Brown  
We got a bottle of red and walked downtown  
One hand on the jug and one on time  
He said, "I bet you a dollar against this next line"  
I said, "don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine"  
Oh, advice is fine if you've got a mind  
To listen to the end that's got the time  
But the muse?ll get ya if you don't watch out  
He's equipped to know what it?s all about  
don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, Fanon street in the afternoon is  
An easy way to get out of tune  
But the hard soap salesman, he said, "No dice"  
When I asked politely for a better price  
He said, "don't let that sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine"  
Well, here's a song for you, child of mine  
I hope you make it through this time  
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie  
No reason in the world you can't get by  
But don't let the sunshine fool ya  
And don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
And don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, don't let the sunshine fool ya  

Don't you take it too bad  
If you're feelin' unlovin'  
If you're feelin unfeelin'  
If you're feelin' alone  
Don't take it too bad  
  
'Cause it ain't you to blame, babe  
Lord, it's just some kind of game made  
Out of all of this living  
That we got left to do  
  
And if you go searchin'  
For rhyme or for reason  
Then you won't have the time  
That it take just for talkin'  
About the places you've been, babe  
About the places you've seen, babe  
And how soft the time flies  
Past your window at night  
  
And we just can't have that, girl  
'Cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world  
And a man need a woman just to stand by his side  
And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams  
And roses and playthings  
And the sweetness of springtime  
And the sound of the rain

Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me,  
I'm not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
I've just begun  
To see my way clear  
And it's plain,  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain,  
Just a tear and that's all.  
  
What does she want me to do?  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that it's true  
Then on she goes  
To say I don't care,  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.  
  
She'd like to think that I'm cruel,  
But she knows that's a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me.  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Even though  
I can't change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That she'd understand  
  
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain?  
Can't she see that she grieves  
Just because she's been blindly deceived  
By her shame?  
  
Nothin's what it seems,  
Maybe she'll start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams,  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose?  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains,  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  
She likes to pretend  
It's something that she must defend,  
With her pride  
And I don't intend  
To stand her and be the friend  
From whom she must hide

I decided to improve my social station  
I joined a fraternity organisation  
Tucked in my shirt  
Signed on the line  
Right away they said about to improve my mind  
The car I drove  
The books I read  
The food I ate  
The booze I drank  
The girls I took out  
My breath  
  
Said "Kid, we don't much like the way you walk  
And you gonna have to change the way you talk"  
They said "your dress is kind of sludge  
And your attitude is mighty grudge"  
Said "you got to learn to bubble"  
"You got to bubble with enthusiasm" I started bubble  
"Most important thing you can't forget  
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet"  
I never did really understand  
That that's gonna make me anymore a man  
But I learned it  
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds  
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news  
Concerning the payment of monthly dues  
I never did know where that money went  
I never was sure it was well spent  
But I paid it  
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life  
If you want good friends it gonna cost you  
  
Well, finally got to be party time  
I got a great big old jug of wine  
I went back to the house in about an hour  
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours  
Brandy Alexanders  
Frozen daquires  
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another  
  
I could see I was gonna have to do my very best  
To get myself out of that fraternity mess  
I stood right there outside the door  
And I chugged that wine like never before  
Walked inside and bubbled  
All over a couple of their dates  
  
So now everything's back to normal again  
But there is still lots of room for improvement my friend  
'Cause that fraternity stuff is too much for me  
Next time I'm gonna join a sorority  
Really get me something to bubble about

Goin' down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
I can drive me a car  
But I don't need no car at all  
I believe I'll ride that Memphis cannon ball  
  
She runs so fast  
You can't catch her from behind  
Ah, she runs so fast  
You can't catch her from behind  
But I'll be there waitin'  
For that little Memphis girl of mine  
  
Why I left  
Guess I'll never know  
Why I left  
Man, I guess I'll never know  
Sittin' here thinkin'  
I'm one dumb-ass so and so  
  
I'm headed back  
That Memphis train  
She leaves real soon  
The Memphis train  
Sound like she leaves real soon  
Got nothin' to guide me  
'Cept the color of the moon  
Hangin' over Memphis  
  
Headed down  
Where the Mississippi runs  
Boys I'm headed home  
Back where the Mississippi runs  
I hear there's some lovin' there  
Try to get me some  
  
Headed down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
Just don't know  
Why I ever left at all  
I'm gettin' on that train, man,  
I ain't even gonna call  
Be there 'fore the break of day

I been gone too long  
Too long gone, too long  
I been travelin' hard  
I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
I want to find me a seven  
Sevens ain't so bad  
Seven's about the best friend  
This poor boy ever had  
You get you a seven  
One and six don't seem so sad  
  
I ain't bein' alone  
Bein' alone too long  
I'm sick of singin' this same ol' lonesome song  
I'm gonna find me a seven and darlin'  
I'm comin' home  
  
It's lonesome down along this ol' highway  
Darlin' I ain't stayin' here  
I don't intend to stay  
You may not want me I'm comin' home anyway  
  
When the sun comes creepin'  
Over the mountain side  
I at least lay down and tell myself I tried  
I ain't like somebody gonna sit  
In no ditch and cry  
  
I been gone too long  
Too long gone, too long  
Travelin' hard I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
Too long gone  
Too long gone, too long  
Travelin' hard, I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong

Greensboro woman don't you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway I'll be home soon  
for once is someone waitin' there  
and if you don't mind  
I just think on her instead  
  
Your face, she's a picture, babe  
pictures ain't what I crave  
I don't feel this way most generally  
I just pit a thousand miles 'tween me  
and where my thoughts do lie  
and I thank you kindly baby to kindly let me be  
  
Your car, she's smooth and fast  
babe, your bourbon's fine  
but I ain't feelin free and clear today  
Texas loving laying on my mind  
I couldn't do you right babe spinnin' round this way  
  
Greensboro woman don't you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway I'll be home soon  
for once is someone waitin' there  
and if you don't mind  
I just think on her instead

I come from a long line  
High and low and in between  
Same as you  
Hills of golden  
Hails of poison  
Time's thrown me through  
And I believe I've come to learn  
That turnin' round  
Is to become confusion  
And the gold's no good for spending  
And the poison's hungry waiting  
  
What can you leave behind  
When you're flyin' lightning fast  
And all alone?  
Only a trace, my friend,  
Spirit of motion born  
And direction grown.  
A trace that will not fade  
In frozen skies  
Your journey will be  
And if her shadow doesn't seem much company  
Who said it would be?  
  
There is the highway  
And the homemade lovin' kind  
The highway's mine  
And us ramblers are getting the travelling down  
You fathers build with stones  
That stand and shine  
Heaven's where you find it  
And you can't  
Take too much with you  
But daddy, don't you listen  
It's just this highway talkin'  
  
All things at our life  
Are brothers in the soil  
And in the sky  
And I believe it  
With my blood  
If not my eyes  
I don't know why we can't  
Be brothers here  
I know we should be  
Answers don't seem easy  
And I'm wonderin'  
If they could be

My days, they are the highway kind  
They only come to leave  
But the leavin' I don't mind  
It's the comin' that I crave.  
Pour the sun upon the ground  
Stand to throw a shadow  
Watch it grow into a night  
And fill the spinnin' sky.  
  
Time among the pine trees  
It felt like breath of air  
Usually I just walk these streets  
And tell myself to care.  
Sometimes I believe me  
And sometimes I don't hear.  
Sometimes the shape I'm in  
Won't let me go.  
  
Well, I don't know too much for true  
But my heart knows how to pound  
My legs know how to love someone  
My voice knows how to sound.  
Shame that it's not enough  
Shame that it is a shame.  
Follow the circle down  
Where would you be?  
  
You're the only one I want now  
I never heard your name.  
Let's hope we meet some day  
If we don't it's all the same.  
I'll meet the ones between us,  
And be thinkin' 'bout you  
And all the places I have seen  
And why you where not there.

And if your baby leaves you  
And you got no place to go  
Oh, you come and see me darlin'  
And bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
And you and your old man  
You have a fallin' out  
Well, you come and see me darlin'  
And we'll go steppin' out  
And we'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
Well, I'm headin' out to the city  
Oh, to the city fair  
If you wanna do the boogie, babe  
You can meet me there  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
Oh, we goin' honkin'-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
Honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  

If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was a gouger  
gouge would I wish for  
If I was a fisherman  
fish would i fish for  
If I was a french whore  
frenchies I'd dish for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Turkeys are for flyin'  
chickens are for eatin'  
I'm all for fun  
fun's forbidden  
forbidden's forgotten  
and forgotten's for gettin'  
I wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Buzzards are for circling  
circles are for heroes  
Heroes for floatin'  
fiddles to Nero  
Fingers for countin'  
numbers for zero  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
I'd wear wood teeth  
If I was a policeman  
I'd walk me a stone beat  
If I was a singer  
I'd stop right now  
I wish I had a dollar a day

There's no stronger wind than the one that blows  
Down a lonesome railroad line  
No prettier sight than looking back  
On a town you left behind  
There is nothin' that's as real  
As a love that's in my mind  
  
Close your eyes  
I'll be here in the morning  
Close your eyes  
I'll be here for a while  
  
There's lots of things along the road  
I'd surely like to see  
I'd like to lean into the wind  
And tell myself I'm free  
But your softest whisper's louder  
Than the highways call to me  
  
All the mountains and the rivers  
And the valleys can't compare  
To your blue lit dancin' eyes  
And yellow shining hair  
I could never hit the open road  
And leave you layin' there  
  
Lay your head back easy, love,  
Close your cryin' eyes  
I'll be layin' here beside you  
When the sun comes on the rise  
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails  
And the lonesome bluejay cries.

It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today  
But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway  
Maybe I'll go insane  
I got to stop the pain  
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.  
  
A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams  
She says she'd like to know just what they mean  
I feel like I could die  
As I watch her flying by  
Ride the north wind down to see Kathleen.  
  
Stars hang high above, the oceans roar  
The moon is come to lead me to her door  
There's crystal across the sand  
And the waves, they take my hand.  
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.  
  
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.

Her face was crystal  
Fair and fine  
Her breath was morning  
Her lips were wine  
Her eyes were laughter  
Her touch divine  
Her face was crystal  
And she was mine  
  
If only she  
Could feel my pain  
But feelin' is a burden  
She can't sustain  
So like a summer Thursday  
I cry for rain  
To come and turn  
The ground to green again  
  
If only she  
Could her my songs  
'Bout the empty difference  
'Tween the rights and wrongs  
Then I know that I  
Could stand alone  
As well as they  
Now that she's gone  
  
Her face was crystal  
Fair and fine  
Her breath was morning  
Her lips were wine  
Her eyes were laughter  
Her touch divine  
Her face was crystal  
And she was mine

Oh Loretta she's a barroom girl  
Wears them sevens on her sleeve  
Dances like a diamond shines  
Tell me lies I love to believe  
Her age is always 22  
Her laughing eyes a hazel hue  
Spends my money like water falls  
Loves me like I want her to  
  
Oh, Loretta, won't you say to me  
Darling, put your guitar on  
Have a little shot of booze  
Play a blue a and wailing song  
My guitar rings a melody  
My guitar sings, Loretta's fine  
Long and lazy, blonde and free  
And I can have her any time  
  
Sweetest at the break of day  
Prettiest in the setting sun  
She don't cry when I can't stay  
'Least not 'til she's all alone  
Loretta, I won't be gone long  
Keep your dancing slippers on  
Keep me on your mind a while  
I'll be back, babe, to make you smile

Won't you lend your lungs to me?  
Mine are collapsing  
Plant my feet and bitterly  
Breathe up the time that's passing.  
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give  
Pray the day's not poison  
Stand among the ones that live  
In lonely indecision.  
  
Fingers walk the darkness down  
Mind is on the midnight  
Gather up the gold you've found  
You fool, it's only moonlight.  
And if you stop to take it home  
Your hands will turn to butter  
Better leave this dream alone  
Try to find another.  
  
Salvation sat and crossed herself  
And called the devil partner  
Wisdom burned upon a shelf  
Who'll kill the raging cancer  
Seal the river at its mouth  
Take the water prisoner  
Fill the sky with screams and cries  
Bathe in fiery answers  
  
Jesus was an only son  
And love his only concept  
But strangers cry in foreign tongues  
And dirty up the doorstep  
And I for one, and you for two  
Ain't got the time for outside  
Keep your injured looks to you  
We'll tell the world that we tried

[Chorus:]  
It's many a fine lady has laid down beside me  
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rain  
Some tried to hold me, to hurt me, to hide me  
Some turned away, not to look back again  
  
One stood among them, I remember most clearly  
Her sorrows were heavy, and her laughter was slow  
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly  
And I came her majestic reflections to know  
  
Her words, like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty  
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawl  
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly  
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all  
  
Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind  
Slashing and slicing to take him his toll  
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting  
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul  
  
No longer gypsy-like sadness unending  
Her eyes - they lie hollow and her face petrified  
Some will go laughing and others condemning  
But who there among you could have told her goodbye?  
  
[Chorus]

The wicked king of clubs awoke  
It was to his queen turned  
His lips were laughing as they spoke  
His eyes like bullets burned  
The sun's upon a gambling day  
His queen smiled low and blissfully  
Let's make some wretched fool to play  
Plain it was she did agree  
  
He send his deuce down into diamond  
His four to hart, and his trey to spade  
Three kings with their legions come  
Preparations soon where made  
They voted club the days commander  
Gave him an army face and number  
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds  
And the aces in the sky  
  
He give his sevens first instructions  
Spirit me a game of stud  
Stakes unscarred by limitation  
'Tween a man named Gold and man named Mud  
Club filled Gold with greedy vapors  
'Til his long, green eyes did glow  
Mud was left with the sighs and trembles  
Watching his hard earned money go  
  
Flushes fell on Gold like water  
Tens they paired and paired again  
But the aces only flew through heaven  
And the diamond jack called no man friend  
The diamond queen saw Muds ordeal  
Began to think of her long lost son  
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy  
Prayed to the angels every one  
  
The diamond queen, she prayed and prayed  
And the diamond angel filled Muds hole  
The wicked king of clubs himself  
Fell in face down in front of Gold  
Now three kings come to Clubs command  
But the angels from the sky did ride  
Three kings up on the streets of Gold  
Three fireballs on the muddy side  
  
The club queen heard her husband's call  
But Lord that queen of diamond's joy  
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall  
Turned out to be a wandering boy  
Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all  
And Mud he raised and Gold did call  
And the smile just melted off his face  
When Mud turned over that diamond ace  
  
Now here's what this story's told  
If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold  
If you feel like lost, you'll end up found  
So amigo, lay them raises down

My home is Colorado  
With their proud mountains tall  
Where the rivers like gypsys  
Down her black canyons fall  
I'm a long, long way from Denver  
With a long way to go  
So lend an ear to my singing  
'Cause I'll be back no more  
  
I left as a young man  
Not full seventeen  
With nothin' for company  
But the wind and a dream  
'Bout all the fast ladies  
And livin' I'd find  
When I left my proud mountains  
And rivers behind  
  
So I rolled and a-rambled  
Like a leaf in the wind  
Well, I found my fast ladies  
And some hard livin' men  
Well, I sometimes went hungry  
With my pockets all bare  
Lord, I sometimes had good luck  
With money to spare  
  
I made me some friends, Lord,  
That I won't soon forget  
Some are down under  
And some are rambling yet  
But as for me  
I'm headed for home  
Back to high Colorado  
Never more for to roam  
  
So friends, when my time comes  
As surely it will  
You just carry my body  
Out to some lonesome hill  
And lay me down easy  
Where the cool rivers run  
With only my mountains  
'Tween me and the sun  
  
My home is Colorado

On the banks of the Niles I courted my love  
I walked with her soft as a mournin' dove  
I loved her true I swear I still do  
And now she's gone without me  
  
I walk by the banks and give the Lord thanks  
That I had the chance to court her  
I don't know why he flew her away  
I don't know why I'm left here  
  
The Niles runs cold and clear  
As cold and clear as my tears  
I'll never forget, I'll never regret  
Those days on the beautiful Niles  
  
Her name was Diane her beautiful hands  
Were soft as the pearls in the water  
I looked in her eyes they were blue as the skies  
And now I've gone and left her  
  
I'll follow her down the way to the river  
Follow her now, now and forever  
She's my one and only smile  
On the beautiful banks of the Niles  
  
Someday soon 'neath the light of the moon  
When the sun and the rain shine together  
I'll meet her down where the waters flow  
And continue to flow forever  
  
Down on the banks of the beautiful Niles  
I wonder what I can be thinking  
Down on the banks of that beautiful river  
I'll wander, look for her forever  
I'll wander, look for her forever

This nine pound hammer,  
Is a little too heavy,  
For my side, baby for my side.  
  
I'm a-goin' to the mountain,  
Gonna see my baby.  
But I ain't comin' back,  
No. I ain't comin' back.  
  
Roll on, buddy,  
Don't ya roll so slow.  
How, can I roll,  
When my wheels won't go.  
  
Well. it's a long way to Harlan,  
It's a long way to hazard,  
Just to get a little brew,  
Just to get a little brew.  
  
When I'm long gone,  
Don't you make my tombstone,  
Outta number nine coal,  
Outta number nine coal.

We had our day but now it's over  
We had our song but now it's sung  
We had our stroll through summers clover  
But summer's gone now, our walkin's done  
  
So tell me gently who be your lover  
Who be your lover after I'm gone  
Will it be the moon that hears your sighin'  
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome song  
  
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom  
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair  
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning  
Will a rose be in your arms when I find you waitin' there  
  
None but the rain should cling to my bosom  
None but the moon should hear my lonesome sigh  
None but the wind should warn of your returning  
Fare thee well, my love, good-bye

Hey mama, when you leave  
Don't leave a thing behind  
I don't want nothin'  
I can't use nothin'  
  
Take care into the hall  
And if you see my friends  
Tell them I'm fine  
Not using nothin'  
  
Almost burned out my eyes  
Threw my ears down to the floor  
I didn't see nothin'  
I didn't hear nothin'  
  
I stood there like a block of stone  
Knowin' all I had to know  
And nothin' more  
Man, that's nothin'  
  
As brothers our troubles are  
Locked in each others arms  
And you better pray  
They never find you  
  
Your back ain't strong enough  
For burdens doublefold  
They'd crush you down  
Down into nothin'  
  
Being born is going blind  
And buying down a thousand times  
To echoes strung  
On pure temptation  
  
Sorrow and solitude  
These are the precious things  
And the only words  
That are worth rememberin'

My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom  
The moon's dancin' purple  
All through her black hair  
And a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window  
And the sun will rise soon  
On the false and the fair  
  
She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain  
Her skin fits her tightly  
And her lips do not lie  
She silently slips from her throat a medallion  
Slowly she twirls it  
In front of my eyes  
  
I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her  
The satin she's wearin'  
Is shimmering blue  
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping  
My dogs have gone hunting  
The howling is through  
  
So I reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison  
And her hair turns to splinters,  
And her flesh turns to brine  
She leaps cross the room, she stands in the window  
And screams that my first-born  
Will surely be blind  
  
She throws herself out to the black of the nightfall  
She's parted her lips  
But she makes not a sound  
I fly down the stairway, and I run to the garden  
No trace of my true love  
Is there to be found  
  
So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'  
By mother the mountain  
I swear that it's true  
Love not a woman with hair black as midnight  
And her dress made of satin  
All shimmering blue

Living on the road my friend,  
Is gonna keep you free and clean  
Now you wear your skin like iron,  
Your breath as hard as kerosene.  
You weren't your mama's only boy,  
But her favorite one it seems  
She began to cry when you said goodbye,  
And sank into your dreams.  
  
Pancho was a bandit boy,  
His horse was fast as polished steel  
He wore his gun outside his pants  
For all the honest world to feel.  
Pancho met his match you know  
On the deserts down in Mexico  
Nobody heard his dying words,  
Ah but that's the way it goes.  
  
All the Federales say  
They could have had him any day  
They only let him slip away  
Out of kindness, I suppose.  
  
Lefty, he can't sing the blues  
All night long like he used to.  
The dust that Pancho bit down south  
Ended up in Lefty's mouth  
The day they laid poor Pancho low,  
Lefty split for Ohio  
Where he got the bread to go,  
There ain't nobody knows  
  
The poets tell how Pancho fell,  
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels  
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,  
And so the story ends we're told  
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,  
But save a few for Lefty too  
He only did what he had to do,  
And now he's growing old

Sunrise comes and I don't know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin' side by side  
  
How many of your skies are blue?  
How much of your love is true?  
Where to get them eyes of green?  
I'm knowin' you know just what I mean  
  
If I have to go I won't be long  
Maybe we'll move to Tennessee  
Leave these Texas blues behind  
See Susanna and Guy  
  
Well, I'm in this cold room all alone  
I guess I'll try the telephone  
It'll be busy or she won't be home  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Sunrise comes and I don't know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin' side by side

I used to wake and run with the moon  
I lived like a rake and a young man  
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds  
My laughter the devil would frighten  
The sun she would come and beat me back down  
But every cruel day had its nightfall  
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars  
Full of fire and forgetful  
  
My body was sharp the dark air clean  
And outrage my joyful companion  
Whisperin' women how sweet did they seem  
Kneelin' for me to command them  
And time was like water but I was the sea  
I'd have never noticed it passin'  
Except for the turnin' of night into day  
And the turnin' of day into cursin'  
  
You look at me now, and don't think I don't know  
What all your eyes are a sayin'  
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies  
They're just tricks that his brains been a playin'?  
A lover of women he can't hardly stand  
He trembles he's bent and he's broken  
I've fallen it's true but I say unto you  
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken  
  
I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known  
I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven  
But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and  
Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding  
I buried my face but it spoke once again  
The night to the day we're a bindin'  
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin  
And even the moonlight is blinding

When the bandits have stolen your jewelry and gone  
and your crippled young gypsy, he's grown tall and strong  
and your dead misconceptions have proven you wrong  
well then, princess, where you plannin' to turn to?  
when your magazine memory has spun you around  
and you realize your lovers were just painted clowns  
and outside your window you start hearing sounds  
where they're building a cross for to burn you  
  
when all your bright scarlet turn slowly to blue  
will you stop and decide that it's over?  
  
When your teardrops go sour and no longer fall  
the splash cross the virgin that lives down your hall  
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall  
well then, what will you have you can offer?  
When the firedancers finish and leave you alone  
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone  
that hang round your neck, slicing through to the bone  
will there still be place for your laughter?  
  
As your shattered illusions come a-tumblin' home  
and all of the butchers you've nourished have grown  
and they are suddenly able to leave you alone  
and they run like slaves that are set free  
when your questions are answered and your pleading is done  
and your mind starts to screaming that you ain't the one  
that once dwelled within you, will you turn, will you run  
Then princess, will you come home and get me?

The folks - they just can't take no more  
Throw you in the back seat, slam the door  
No stoppin' as down the road you go  
Got not time to lose  
  
Gigantic one-way gate ahead  
You're thinkin', man, I'd as soon be dead  
They decided to give you life instead  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Big ol' nurse all dressed in white  
Slaps you on a table in the middle of the night  
Then he straps you down real tight  
You're wonderin', what'd I do?  
  
They hose you down, make sure you're clean  
Wrap you up in hospital green  
Shoot you full of Thorazine  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Could be TB or maybe a tumor  
Eavesdropping on the doctors, listening to the rumors  
Can't see your friends, hear the hum of the wheels  
Hey, my man, you know how it feels  
Like the sanitarium blues  
  
Then upon some sunlit day  
They figure there's no need for you to stay  
They're pretty sure you can't be cured  
So they send you on your merry way  
  
You hit the pavement, hang around  
Nobody's on the outside to be found  
You're just tryin' to stay above the ground  
You start to thinkin', what's the use?  
The sanitarium blues

You're wakin' next to me  
Tears splash across the sun  
You whisper soft to me  
That I ain't the only one  
To breathe your yellow hair  
Caress your bosom fair  
Do you think I really care?  
Do you think it matters?  
  
What do your feelin's mean?  
Do you think I'd love more  
If you stood pure and clean  
Of those you'd known before  
Would your words be sweeter then  
Upon November's wind  
If you began again  
Could your smile be softer?  
Would your eyes more brightly shine?  
Would your laughter be so tender  
If you'd been only mine  
For as long as you remember?  
  
I don't want tears from you  
Don't build your love on shame  
All what we've done is through  
And all we can do remains  
My lady can't you see  
I love not jealously  
But for all you are to me  
And all you'll be tomorrow

She came and she touched me  
With hands made of heaven  
Reflections sent spinnin'  
Through a face laced in mist  
Now I stand where she left me  
Buried deep 'neath her shadow  
And the mirror plead sadly  
Does it all come to this  
And I wonder: Will she call my name?  
  
The wind careens madly  
Through wide windows paneless  
Fragrancies mingle  
In a room full of shade  
The peons pick partners  
And waltz cross the ceilings  
But the violins whisper  
That I've been betrayed  
Tryin not to look ashamed  
  
The drunkards drink deeply  
From cups full of nothingness  
Ghost lovers laugh  
At the games that they play  
The moments do somersaults  
Into eternity  
Cling to their coattails  
And beg them to stay  
Saying I got nothing to hide  
  
Illusions projected  
On walls made of Tiffany  
Mad minuets to  
A sad satin song  
A harlequin mandolins  
Harmonize helplessly  
Hoping that endlessly  
Won't last for long  
Praying that their God ain't dying  
  
Then I turn and I see her  
In a dress made of moonlight  
Teardrops like diamonds  
Run slow down her face  
Her arms surround me  
Like chains made of velvet  
And the demons fall faithfully  
Into their place  
And the rivers run with jewels  
  
Now the morning lies open  
The night went quite quickly  
Memory harmlessly  
Fractures and fades  
All the poets do push-ups  
On carpets of rubber foam  
Loudly they laugh  
At some joke that's been made  
And the wise men speak like fools

Mr ten dollar man  
Let me tell where you're bound  
Drink your green liqour, Lord  
You'll roll to the ground  
But you come around here  
With your money in your hand  
Taste of my woman  
Well, you die where you stand  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body she'd find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time  
  
Snake mountain gonna crumble  
And fall from the sky  
Before that woman of mine  
Stops tellin' her lies  
If I'd die, Lord, she'd weep  
She'd weep and she'd mourn  
Soon as I's buried  
Forget I'd been born  
  
Love of blackskin woman  
She won't do you no wrong  
Slow to start moaning  
She don't moan for long  
Yellow headed woman  
Brings nothing but pain  
Take all you give her  
She leaves only shame  
  
My daddy, Lord, he rides  
On a long holy train  
First winds of winter  
I see him again  
In this farewell to this  
Yellow headed misery I've known  
Snake mountain's calling  
Calling me home  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body she'd find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time

You can't hold me  
I'm too slippery  
I do no sleepin'  
I get lonely  
You can touch me  
If you want to  
I got poison  
I just might bite you  
  
Lie in circles  
On the sunlight  
Shine like diamonds  
On a dark night  
Ain't no mercy  
In my smilin'  
Only fangs and  
Sweet beguiling  
  
Future, he don't  
Try to find me  
Skin I been through  
Dies behind me  
Solid hollow  
Wrapped in hatred  
Not a drop of  
Venom wasted  
  
You can slip in  
Try to find me  
Hold your breath and  
Flat deny me  
It makes no difference  
To my thinkin'  
I'll be here when  
You start sinkin'.

Headin' from El Paso  
Ridin' down the highway  
Look out my window  
What do I see  
Some armadillo done gone crazy  
Flew in front of semi  
Man, looks like squash to me  
  
Thinkin' 'bout my my baby  
Livin' down in Houston  
Wonder if that squashes armadillo too  
Guess I'll stop in Greenland  
And have me some ol' veggies  
This highway will do that to you  
  
I'm thinkin' Squash  
On the highway  
Coyote and Armadillo, Possum too  
I'm talkin' Squash  
Out on the highway  
Vitamin D and A and be Complex too  
I'm talkin' Squash  
  
Domestic Animals  
SQUASH!  
Occasional Cat  
SQUASH!  
In the Winter it's frozen food  
SQUASH!  
I'm talkin' Squash  
Winter kill  
Out on the highway  
Summer too  
I'm talkin Squash  
Vitamin A and B1 too  
I'm talkin Squash  
SQUASH!  
Out on the highway  
If you promise to do your part  
I'll do mine too

When she had twenty years she turned to her mother  
Saying Mother, I know that you'll grieve  
But I've given my soul to St John the gambler  
Tomorrow comes time leave  
For the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever  
And dead men lay deep 'round the door  
The only salvation that's mine for the asking  
So mother, think on me no more  
Winter held high round the mountains breast  
And the cold of a thousand snows  
Lay heaped upon the forests leaf  
But she dressed in calico  
For a gambler likes his women fancy  
Fancy she would be  
And the fire of her longing would keep way the cold  
And her dress was a sight to see  
But the road was long beneath the feet  
She followed her frozen breath  
In search of a certain St John the gambler  
Stumbling to her death  
She heard his laughter right down from the mountains  
And danced with her mothers tears  
To a funeral drawn a calico  
'neath the cross of twenty years  
To a funeral drawn a calico  
'neath the cross of twenty years

The name she gave was Caroline  
Daughter of a miner  
Her ways were free  
It seemed to me  
That sunshine walked beside her  
  
She came from Spencer  
Across the hill  
She said her pa had sent her  
'cause the coal was low  
And soon the snow  
Would turn the skies to winter  
  
She said she'd come  
To look for work  
She was not seeking favors  
And for a dime a day  
And a place to stay  
She'd turn those hands to labor  
  
But the times were hard, Lord,  
The jobs were few  
All through Tecumseh valley  
But she asked around  
And a job she found  
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's  
  
She saved enough to get back home  
When spring replaced the winter  
But her dreams were denied  
Her pa had died  
The word come down from Spencer  
  
So she turned to whorin' out on the streets  
With all the lust inside her  
And it was many a man  
Returned again  
To lay himself beside her  
  
They found her down beneath the stairs  
That led to Gypsy Sally's  
In her hand when she died  
Was a note that cried  
Fare thee well  
Tecumseh valley  
  
The name she gave was Caroline  
Daughter of a miner  
Her ways were free  
It seemed to me  
That sunshine walked beside her

Of those that sailed the silver ships  
From Andilar I am the last  
The deeds that rang our youthful dreams  
It seems shall go undone  
North for the shores of Valinor  
Our bows and crimson sails were made  
Our captains were strong, our lances long  
And our liege the holy king  
  
The hills did turn from green to blue  
And vanish as on the decks we watched  
But every thought in that noble company  
Was forward bound  
To the lifeless plains of Valinor  
Where reigns the dark and frozen one  
And with tongues afire and glorious eyes  
We pledged our mission be  
  
The clime from mild to bitter ran  
The wind from fair to fierce did blow  
Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts  
Of homes left far behind  
Longed every man for some glimpse of land  
And the host that did await us there  
But each new day brought only a sea  
And sky of ice and gray  
  
Thanks give no word can drag you through  
Those endless weeks our ships did roll  
Thanks give you cannot see those sails  
And faces bleach and draw  
Ice we drank and leather did chew  
For the oceans are unwholesome there  
The dead that slid into the seas  
Did freeze before our eyes  
  
Then a wind did fling the ships apart  
Each one to go her separate way  
The sky did howl, the hull did groan  
For how long I do not know  
And what men were left when the winds had ceased  
Grew dull and low of countenance  
For soldiers denied their battle plain  
On comrades soon must turn  
  
So one by one we died alone  
Some by hunger, some by steel  
Bodies froze where they did fall  
Their souls unsanctified  
Until only another and I were left  
Then just before his flame did fail  
We shone ourselves brothers-in-arms  
To serve the holy king  
  
Perhaps this shall reach Andilar  
Although I know not how it can  
For once again he's hurled his wind  
Upon the silver prow  
But if it should my words are these  
Arise young men fine ships to build  
And set them north for Valinor  
'neath standards proud as fire

So close and yet so far away  
And all the things I'd hoped to say  
Will have to go unsaid today  
Perhaps until tomorrow  
Your fear has built a wall between  
Our lives and all what lovin' means  
Will have to go unfelt it seems  
And that leaves only sorrow  
  
You built your tower strong and tall  
Can't you see it's got to fall some day  
  
You close your eyes and speak to me  
Of faith and love and destiny  
As distant as eternity,  
Truth and understanding  
The wind blows cold outside your door  
It whispers words I've tried before  
But you don't hear me anymore  
Your pride's just too demanding  
  
The end is coming soon, it's plain  
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain  
And I will go and you'll remain  
With the bitterness we tasted  
A mother's breast, a newborn child  
A poet's tear, and drunken smile  
Can't help thinkin' all the while  
Their meaning won't be wasted

I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore  
  
Well now, this old world sometimes it does get lonesome  
And it's many a grown man has hung his head and cried  
Down in your soul there's one that won't desert you  
Ain't it fine to have the Saviour by your side  
  
Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden  
And faith is the door and love is the key  
And warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows  
And that light, my friend, it shines on you and me  
  
When the wind blows on that faithful morning  
And I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home  
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me  
I'll be batheing in the glory of the throne  
  
I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore

Be my staple and my stay  
Jesus help through each day  
As I walk this weary way  
Upon my soul  
  
And when judgement falls to me  
Through my saviour shall I be  
Given peace eternally  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
Given peace eternally  
Upon my soul  
  
Jesus shine your light on me  
Shine with love and charity  
That I might help brothers see  
Upon my soul  
  
For temptation let me ply  
Be my wings, Lord, be my eyes  
Guard me when old Satan's nigh  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
Guard me when old Satan's nigh  
Upon my soul  
  
I shall fill each earhly day  
With the singing of his praise  
Follow in his holy ways  
Upon my soul  
  
And when I lay my troubles down  
On my brow he'll place a crown  
And the trumpets all shall sound  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
And the trumpets all shall sound  
Upon my soul

Like silent she stands  
like laughter she falls  
from a castle of sand  
like a memory she crawls  
and the mockingbirds grieve  
'Cause they can't make her cry  
they'll soon start to believe  
that the lady has died  
what it all goes to show  
it ain't my job to say  
for who am I to know  
why she's actin' this way  
  
Once again turn away  
if you're sure that it's done  
tell your prophets to pray  
tell your bandits to run  
take your eyelids of stone  
they won't do you no harm  
take your cross made of bones  
take your your fly-paper arms  
and when everything's placed  
in your coffin and go  
through a scarf 'round your face  
'Cause the subway gets cold  
pack up your sunflower smile  
and your bandana blues  
take your worthless denials  
they're all you've got left to lose  
take your Tinkerbell lies  
and your weary desires  
take the tears in your eyes  
take your cup full of fire  
give your lover a call  
if your legs start to fail  
and he'll come break your fall  
with a bed full of nails  
  
No need to glance back again  
there ain't nothin' to see  
just this drunken old man  
and this woman and me  
and you've made it quite plain  
that we're just wastin' time  
and you say that it seems strange  
that I'm staying behind  
but you don't worry 'bout me  
I can make it alone  
'Cause I got no place to be  
and I ain't far from home

Well, the birds were talking all at once  
And the old man mowing down his lawn  
He didn't look like much too bad a guy  
And I was thinkin' Hang on, man, something's wrong  
Your blues seems to be gone  
Heaven ain't bad but you don't get nothing done.  
  
Lay down your head a while  
You are not needed now  
You are not needed now  
  
Well, Allison laid a hex on me  
And every time I turn around  
It's swimming through the air above my bed  
I told Miss Higgs and she said fine  
As long as you're back in your room on time  
I keep you clean and the girls will keep you fed  
  
Lay down your head with mine  
You are not needed now  
And we got things to do  
  
Between the blankets made of wool  
The trains roll by every half an hour  
And the body can get no restin' done, that's true  
So I do my best, as best I can  
Thinkin' big and making plans  
And wondering where them trains are rolling to  
  
Lay down your head poor boy  
And feel how the ground does move  
And hear how them drivers sing  
  
Well, goodbye friends, it's time to close  
Everybody knows that's the way it goes  
Where was it you lived in case I'm ever there  
Well, three doors down and two behind  
And it gets a little bit out of hand sometimes  
Don't let it fool you into thinkin you down care  
  
Lay down your head and fly  
I'll quietly pass you by  
You won't even see me go  
  
If I thought about it long enough  
I just might make some kind of move  
Watchful lies are too hard on the soul  
With the smoke house just across the way  
And it's fog upon the light of day  
That would be hard comin' up with where to go  
  
Lay down your head poor boy  
Feel how the ground does move  
Hear how them drivers sing  
What now, my darling one  
Go find a little fun  
You are not needed now
