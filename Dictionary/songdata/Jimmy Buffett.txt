"okay"  
I really do appreciate the fact you're sittin' here  
Your voice sounds so wonderful  
But yer face don't look too clear  
Bar maid bring a pitcher, another round o' brew  
"alright let's here it"  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"you're on the record!"  
Chorus:  
Why don't we get drunk and screw  
I just bought a water bed, it's filled up for me and you  
They say you are a snuff queen  
Honey I don't think that's true  
So, why don't we get drunk and screw.  
"I can't wait for 'em to put that label on my live album. you're sounding
absolutely wonderful out there, but we have invited the all girls choir from
lima, ohio down here and we can't here  
Too well now. we'd like all of you gentlemen out in the audience to just sorta
take a break, sit back and let's let these beautiful women of the nineties
tell us how they feel about it. ladies  
Ou ready? on the count of four. one, two, three, four."  
Chorus:  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"whoo yeah!"  
I just bought a waterbed it's filled up with elmer's glue."  
They say you are a snuff queen  
Let's see what all you macho men can do  
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)  
"oh yeah."  
Why don't we get drunk and screw  
"I think we better work this out amongst ourselves."  
Why don't we get drunk and screw, oooh yeah

1970  
Sittin' on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin' at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Made this stop for personal reasons  
Didn't know I'd catch the changin' of the seasons  
Winter dictates everything from frost to naked trees  
Chorus:  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
I've walked this ground from town to town  
Just to finally call it mine  
Lookin' for the cloud with a styrofoam lining  
Hopin' that the sun will keep on shinin'  
Leading me to distant peace that waits so patiently  
Need a little love to try some givin'  
Try a little love and then start livin'  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
Chorus:  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
I've walked this ground from town to town  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Sittin' on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin' at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Need a little time to try some livin'  
Try a little love and then start givin'  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
Where God and trees create the breeze  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  

Mother, mother ocean, I've heard you call  
Wanted to sail upon your waters  
Since I was three feet tall  
You've seen it all, you've seen it all  
  
Watch the men who rode you  
Switch from sails to steam  
And in your belly you can hold the treasures  
Few have ever seen  
Most of them dream  
Most of them dream  
  
Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late  
Cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder  
I'm an over forty victim of fate  
Arriving too late, arriving too late  
  
But I've done a bit of smugglin'  
I've run my share of grass  
Made enough money to buy Miami  
But I pissed it away so fast  
Never meant to last  
Never meant to last  
  
I have been drunk now for over two weeks  
Passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks  
But I've got to stop wishin', got to go fishin'  
I'm down to rock bottom again.  
Just a few friends  
Just a few friends  
  
I go for younger women, lived with several awhile  
Though I ran them away, they come back one day  
And still could manage a smile  
It just takes awhile, just takes awhile  
  
Mother, mother ocean, after all my years I've found  
Occupational hazard be my occupations just not around  
Feel like I've drowned but all were frowned  
Feel like I've drowned

Disembarking at Duvalier Airport  
Seeking transportation to town  
As the purple ink dried on his passport  
He could still feel the eyes look around  
  
"Messieur ou est le casino?"  
He spoke to the cabbie and smiled  
The driver replied "Vieux ou noveaux?"  
As he motioned the dark man inside.  
  
Business in Aruba concluded  
He now had a little money to spend  
That's how I came to meet my African friend  
  
We were rollin' the bones several hours  
Conversing as most gamblers do  
We were calling on all of our powers  
Hoping to see the night through.  
  
But not approving at all of our winning  
The pit boss he tugged at his sleeve  
Through the whole thing my new friend was grinning  
When he motioned it's time we should leave.  
  
With our night at the tables behind us  
We were ready just to do it again  
That's when I came to know my African Friend  
  
But I woke up on the steps of a whorehouse  
Soldier told me I' better leave  
As I stumbled to find me a taxi  
I saw a note pinned to my sleeve.  
  
"It was a pleasure and a hell of an evening  
Truly was our night to win  
But the authorities insist on my leaving  
Take care, my American friend."  
  
With my weekend at Haiti concluded  
I now had a little money to spend  
That's when I came to meet my African friend  
That's how I came to know another good friend.

See the lady  
Smiles as if to tell  
Her son remembers everyone  
Treats 'em all quite well  
He never asked for promises  
And now his fame is wide  
And everyone who knew him well shares a little pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't he a genius?  
The boy's become a star  
And he smiles upon the faces  
Who wish they could go far  
  
Not long ago they criticized  
The genius only wrote  
And now they listen spellbound  
With lumps caught in their throats  
  
His virtue was sheer poverty  
His vice was reading plays  
While other children starved and fought  
He learned just what to say  
Through tension and confession  
He beat the monster down  
Then surfaced in society no longer underground  
  
[Chorus]  
Now they remember  
Talk only of his good  
While jealousy flows in their veins  
And says I wish I could  
  
Ain't he a genius?

The hills are full of secrets  
Owls watch by night  
Down in town the bars are full  
And the drunks are picking fights  
These are things I know  
But the facts are filtered through  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
2:19 freight train  
Moaning somewhere near  
I see you in the distance  
But I can't get there from here  
Hard to believe its happening  
But my whole world's shrunken to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
Stars look down and laugh at me  
I ought to take a bow  
Don't have to tell them life's hard sometimes  
There's one falling now  
Nobody's here beside me  
I can talk about it to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you

Oh no, he's buying an island  
Oh no, he's building a boat  
Why does he never stop smiling?  
Fun surrounds him like a deep moat  
  
Where does he get all those stories?  
How can he tell such a lie?  
He's bound to see purgatory  
His views are in short supply  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
Good God, he's talking with parrots  
Painting his dreams in the sand  
Piling up beaucoup demerits  
Doing it just 'cause he can  
  
By Jove he's having a cocoa  
Evading those judgmental eyes  
Calmly walking his tight rope  
High above all the outcries  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
The story goes  
he stumbled at the alter  
Now it seems he just blasphemes  
And dwells with dangers daughter  
  
Someone call the talking doctor  
Somebody get a SWAT team  
There he sits getting away with  
murder  
How dare him live out his dreams  
  
But Peter Pan would understand  
His schemes and dreams and ploys  
Best keep an eye on his slight hand  
He such an altered boy  
  
Oh no, he's sailing today  
Oh no, beware Paraguay  
Oh no, anchors aweigh  
Oh no

Another Saturday night  
By: Jimmy Buffett  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
I've seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  
But as yet I haven't met 'em  
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Now another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat name Frankenstein  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Yeah, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend this money  
I'm headin' back to key west town  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Just another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
It's awful, all dressed up and no place to go, no one to help me spend  
My flow, another Saturday night, get me the pizza man.

Tomorrow may come, it usually does  
Don't know what it will bring to the two of us  
I just want you to know  
What I'm ready to do  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
  
When I'm holding you tight, you give me the power  
To burn like a torch in the darkest hour  
Tell me what you need  
I will surely come through  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
  
Passion runs deep, it's scary sometimes  
When it's larger than life or your peace of mind  
It's got me all the same  
And I'm not sorry that's true  
  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you  
Anything, anytime, anywhere  
For you

MACHINE FOR BAD HABITS?  
I THINK I'LL APPLY FOR THAT CARD

Follow in my wake, you've not that much at stake  
For I have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, the hard work has been done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
  
Just for starters, barometer is my soup  
I'm descended from a deck hand on a sloop  
I travel on the song lines that only dreamers see  
Not known for predictability  
  
Come and follow in our wake, you've not that much at stake  
For we have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, seems our work is done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
  
Sail the main course, sail it in a simple sturdy craft  
Keep her well stocked with short stories and long laughs  
Go fast enough to get there, but slow enough to see  
Moderation seems to be the key  
  
Constantly searching  
Oh my eyes have seen some horizons  
And I've crossed the oceans  
For more than just thrills  
No I'm not the first  
Won't be the last  
You lust for the future  
But treasure the past  
  
Follow in my wake, you've not that much at stake  
For I have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, the hard work has been done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters

Cameron's getting logical,  
A Vulcan in disguise,  
The mysteries of the night are  
Putting sparkle in his eyes.  
He's looking for sound reasoning,  
But the best that I can do,  
Is this transcendental story,  
That I'll pass along to you.  
  
Past the falls they call Victoria,  
Down the river named the Nile,  
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat,  
It's shaped just like a smile.  
  
And steered by a magician,  
With the knowledge that he needs,  
To keep him on his destined course,  
Past the crocodiles and reeds.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean,  
The Lone Eagle in the sky,  
He gave me my first sextant,  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
It's been quite a lengthy passage,  
From the dawn of time till now,  
He has weathered the infernal storms  
In his trusty petite dow.  
  
He has soared about colossal waves,  
Sailed the endless sea.  
Sometimes he resembles you,  
Sometimes he looks like me.  
  
I saw him through my telescope,  
On a cloudless night in June,  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
There are windows to the galaxies  
And hallways to the past.  
There are trapdoors to the future  
And a splintered ancient mast.  
There are relics from Apollo trips,  
When the earthmen came to play,  
And a hammock from a distant star,  
Out in the Milky Way.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky.  
He game me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
A stripped bass breaks the surface  
As the sunset fades away  
And our journey from the Sea of Storms  
Takes us home beside the bay.  
We go fishing in the ocean  
We go traveling back in time  
Like the song says 'teach your children'  
To go fishing with their minds.  
  
Cameron's contemplating  
I'm not sure just what he thinks  
"Is my dad some kind of lunatic  
With his stories and high hi-jinks".  
Then he says when I get old and gray  
And feel like I'm marooned,  
He will take me in his rocket ship  
To that beach house on the moon.

Evil it's been here all along  
Good things they just seem to have come and gone  
In my life I have seen so much go wrong  
And there's only one way left for us to get along  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
Papers they print it every day  
Housewife wraps the garbage then throws it away  
I don't guess she thinks they have that much to say  
But when the time is right she'll be the lady with so much to pay  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
History it teaches much too well  
Nations had to rise up before they fell  
And my eyes see the story they're tryin' to tell  
And tonight I think I heard the final toll of the bell  
We better  
  
Bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone

Mayan moon was burning  
We saw visions  
Of the past returning  
On the shore  
The band was playing  
We all heard  
What the moon was saying  
  
The world keeps closing in  
It has before  
It will again  
A voice beyond the wind  
Says we must go  
Beyond the end  
So follow  
Beyond the end  
  
A sea of friends are singing  
Vaya con dios  
Mis amigos  
We take their hopes and feelings  
To some new world  
We'll be revealing  
  
Old worlds keep closing in  
They have before  
They will again  
Voices call  
Beyond the wind  
Say we must go  
Beyond the end  
And follow  
Beyond the end

If I was a road dog, baby  
All of my songs were true  
Reckon' I'd like my whiskey drinkin'  
a whole lot more than I do  
But I don't know about the good life, baby  
Not so sure it's for me  
I'd much rather be home rollin' with you  
Than watching Tom Snyder on TV  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Big rig baby, rollin' on home to you  
  
Now I been to lots of parties  
Spent my whole life in a bar  
There's a whole lot of good lookin' women out there  
Who think I am a star  
Drinkin' and a smokin' ain't really where I am  
If I had my own two ways I'd be rollin' home to Alabam  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
A big rig baby, rollin' on home to you  
  
Now some day I'll be better  
My ramblin' days will be through  
I won't have anymore gigs to play  
I'll be back home there with you  
But meanwhile wait a minute  
What's that thing I see  
It's a good lookin' woman with a bottle of Scotch  
And she wants to go home with me  
  
She's lookin' like a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was big rig, a big rig baby  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you

The moon's smiling over my shoulder  
I know these same stars will shine when I'm older  
So I'm keeping heaven on my mind  
'Cause a good love is so hard to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it's bigger than the both of us  
Deeper than the sea  
Tossing on the water riding destiny  
Bigger than the both of us  
Farther than the eye can see  
We're dancing, our souls are dancing  
Infinity  
  
You know there's a million ways to fail  
But I know this isn't just a fairy tale  
It's a one in million paradise  
And I know love is the light in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing

Down around Biloxi  
Pretty girls are dancin' in the sea  
They all look like sisters in the ocean  
The boy will fill his pail with salty water  
And the storms will blow from off towards New Orleans  
  
Sun shines on Biloxi  
Air is filled with vapors from the sea  
Boy will dig a pool beside the ocean  
He sees creatures from his dream underwater  
And the sun will set from off towards New Orleans  
  
Stars can see Biloxi  
Stars can find their faces in the sea  
We are walking down beside the ocean  
We are splashing naked in the water  
And the sky is red from off towards New Orleans  
And the sky is red from off towards New Orleans  
  
Down around Biloxi  
Pretty girls are swimming in the sea  
They all look like sisters in the ocean  
The boy will fill his pail with salty water  
And the storms will blow from off toward New Orleans

Blue light guitars  
And tropical breeze  
Hummingbirds mime the words  
As they dance in the trees  
It's a flashback kind of crowd  
It's a cabaret sound  
There's still some magic left  
In this tourist town  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
  
We were weird roman candles  
Burning bright at both ends  
At the end of the road  
Is where this story begins  
Where the green of the gulf  
Meets the blue of the sea  
What makes it all happen  
Still a mystery to me  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
  
If these walls could talk  
I don't know what they'd say  
They've seen some accidental masquerades  
But it's no surprise  
Dances till dawn, heroes long gone  
Just let that guitar play  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue blue heaven rendezvous

(with Alan Jackson)  
  
It's time for a change  
I'm tired of that same ol same  
The same ol words the same ol lines  
The same ol tricks and the same ol rhymes  
  
Days precious days  
Roll in and out like waves  
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail  
I got charts to make I got seas to sail  
  
I'm gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
It'll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause I've got boats to build  
  
Sails are just like wings  
The wind can make em sing  
Songs of life songs of hope  
Songs to keep your dreams afloat  
I'm gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
It'll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause I've got boats to build  
  
Shores distant shores  
There's where I'm headed for  
Got the stars to guide my way  
Sail into the light of day  
  
I'm gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
It'll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause I've got boats to build

Well, You've heard about the alligators sleepin' in the shade  
You've heard heard about the sugar barons screwin' up the 'glades,  
It's a melting pot existence  
That is hard to contemplate  
And a never ending battle in the Sunshine State.  
  
But far, far away from the front page news,  
Far, far away from the headline blues,  
Down a secondary road that severely shows its age  
The forties comes to life on a make-shift stage.  
  
It's the Bob Robert's Society Band.  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand.  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud.  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.  
  
Well, the word goes out  
From Melbourne to the Keys.  
The faithful get the message  
Like it's written on the breeze.  
Young folks, old folks,  
'Bout to cut a rug  
Fox Trot, Bunny Hop,  
Do the Jitterbug,  
  
To the Bob Robert's Society Band.  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand.  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud.  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.  
  
I saw mini vans from Boca,  
Buses from Perrine.  
There were people speaking Hindu  
In the Bar-B-Que line.  
A couple on their honeymoon  
Looked a bit confused.  
But the boys in the band put 'em right in the mood.  
They played.....  
  
A lady dressed in purple started dancing all alone  
Then she sauntered oh so gently to the vacant microphone.  
She sounded like she's someone and never missed a beat.  
By the time the number ended they were dancin' in the street.  
  
They'd died and gone to heaven,  
That lively little crowd,  
Trombones and saxophones  
Sent 'em through the clouds.  
It could have gone all night  
But the party had to stop.  
When they blew the circuit breaker  
In the souvenir shop.  
  
It's the Bob Robert's Society Band  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.  
  
It's the Bob Robert's Society Band  
Playing every Sunday down at the Orange Grove Stand  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd

Hole in the wind behind the island  
Big blue hole in the middle of my heart  
I can't forget the time we spent together  
I can't remember how long  
How long we've been apart  
  
[Chorus:]  
Be ridin' on this boomerang love circling fast  
Hard to see in a sky so vast  
Laugh till you cry, cry till you smile  
Up and down all around  
Boomerang boomerang  
Boomerang love  
  
Now we both know, we're now in different orbits  
Different islands, different worlds  
Though we really are the same  
I'm just glad, glad we started talking  
Finally realize no one is to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've been riding on a boomerang love  
Can't let go  
Running fast, movin' slow  
What's the right way, who is to say  
Tension and suspension  
On a boomerang boomerang love  
Boomerang boomerang love  
  
Big blue hole out in the ocean  
Where I dive straight down until  
I can not see  
Feel my way through a bevy of solutions  
There I realize the answer lies in me  
  
Gettin' off of this boomerang love  
Comin' up for air  
Do what's right do what's fair  
Come what may, we'll find a way  
No more tension and suspension  
No more boom boom  
Boomerang love

I'd like to ride the rodeo  
But I've got Brahma fear  
So I'll just stick to airplanes  
Gently pop my ears  
  
Drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
Ah but it let's my feeling show  
  
And I'm somewhere below the spotlight  
Somewhere below the ground  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me, and you've found my sound  
  
Yes, I own a whaler boat  
It slides across the sea  
Some folks say I'm part of it  
And I know it's part of me  
  
And when I'm feelin' solitaire  
It let's me be alone  
And when I want to have a taste  
It carries me back home  
  
And I'm somewhere below the sunlight  
Somewhere upon the sea  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me, cause that's where I'll be  
  
Yes, I drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
But it let's my feelin's show  
Yes, it makes me quite immobile  
Ah, but it let's my feelin's show

Well, he out grew his sequin suit  
Sold his Trailways bus  
Let his hair get a little too long  
Duck tails bit the dust  
His custom made, pearl inlaid guitar  
slipped from his hands  
And in it's place a new electrical one  
He had flown in from Japan  
  
'Cause he's a cheeseburger eatin'  
Abandoned Sunday meetin'  
Brand new country star  
He rides around in a Lincoln Continental  
No steer horns on his car  
Oh the record man say he's the livin' end  
They're gonna spin him right to the top  
Yea, he's a hot roman candle from the Texas panhandle  
  
He can either go country or pop  
Got a good ole' friend name of Texas Ben  
Tells him all the spots to play  
And a sweet little lady, he calls her sexy Sadie  
She's with the boy night and day  
They're gonna open up a chain of fancy bowling lanes  
The first one in his old home town  
And on ribbon cutting day they'll come from miles away  
The folks will all gather round

(Jimmy Buffett and Matt Betton)  
  
I bought a cheap watch from a crazy man  
Floating down canal  
It doesn't use numbers or moving hands  
It always just says now  
Now you may be thinking that I was had  
But this watch is never wrong  
And If I have trouble the warranty said  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, we've seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain leaking through the door, tides at war  
  
If a hurricane doesn't leave you dead  
It will make you strong  
Don't try to explain it just nod your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain buried the 9th Ward to the 2nd floor  
  
According to my watch the time is now  
Past is dead and gone  
Don't try to shake it just nod your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
Don't try to shake it just bow your head  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On

Nothing can tear you apart  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
Though you know that you're gonna hurt some  
The magic will come  
  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
You will know when to stop and to start  
Once you see that no one really wins  
Then the magic begins  
  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic  
  
Beachcombers ride oh children lost in the tide  
Time's never at their command  
Waves melt all castles of sand  
Melts all castles of sand  
  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic  
  
Red sky at night such a sailor's delight  
Red sky at dawn oh gypsy song's comin' on  
Gypsy song comin' on  
Song comin' on  
  
Nothing can tear you apart  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
Though you know that you're gonna hurt some  
The magic will come  
  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
You will know when to start and to stop  
Once you see that no one really wins  
Then the magic begins  
  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Don't make life so tragic

Well the train slipped into the station  
A worn out steel blue soul  
A relic from colonial days  
When the French were still in control  
Lorsque les Francais et tous jour en controle  
  
It's an outpost in transition  
Where the faithful in the bar  
Know from the whistle and the squeaking wheels  
That the next stop is Dakar  
La prochaine etape etait Dakar  
  
Talk on the radio  
Talk on the street  
Talk of men with money loco from the heat  
  
Talk about the rail band  
Picking up the beat  
We lit that great reunion  
With the headlights on the jeep  
  
And there's history on the jukebox  
Where the spies and scoundrels dwell  
It was the place to go in Bamako  
Direction Buffet Hotel  
Direction Buffet Hotel  
  
Now we're lost in the Sahara  
Four hours north of Tombuktu  
Lookin' for a nomad who knows  
Or maybe some wondering Jew  
Allons a Essakane, Syndou  
  
Then we heard that Tuareg combo  
We had come so very far  
And we were welcomed out of history  
By the wind the sand and the stars  
Jai commence a le piercevoir  
  
Sand in the couscous  
Sand in the wine  
There was sand in my guitar case  
Stories in my mind  
  
Machine guns on the hilltop  
Camels in my tent  
Buried in a sandstorm  
As the music came and went  
  
Well we crawled out of that desert  
And the storm erased our tracks  
The Sahara showed her heart to us  
And then she took it back  
  
We owned Buffet Hotel  
Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel  
Ce soir  
Tu la monde  
  
I recall diplomats and hookers  
I saw strangers digging wells  
And for that one great night in Bamako  
We owned Buffet Hotel  
Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel

I'm not saying I'm scared of you  
But your love is something new  
When I hold you we're swaying in the wind  
Of all the bridges I've ever crossed  
High and lonesome and wild and lost  
I feel this time I'll take it to the end  
We don't care what the people may say  
If there's a price it's the price we'll pay  
  
Chorus  
And we'll burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn it down  
Burn it down  
  
We've both done our share of runnin' around  
Now we know enough to know the kind of love  
we've found  
It's the real thing and we've got to see it through  
eI'm a singer and a sailor on a midnight sea  
Oh captain come and take me on your fantasy  
If we're crazy that ain't nothin' new  
'Cause we don't care what the people may say  
If there's a price it's the price we'll pay and  
  
Chorus  
  
Who knows how it started  
Who knows it's ends  
The point of no return is waiting  
just around the bend

Can you tell me where I might find my friend and companion  
Now he looks a little different from anything you've seen  
He likes to beat the bass drum for justice and salvation  
He's got the brains of einstein and the brawn of mister clean  
He's a lightnin' flash who'll make the dash from one coast to the other  
To stop a crime or lend a dime or help his aging mother  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Now he wears a mask his clothes are weird and some folks call him hokie  
But he is hip he just can't dig the okie from muskogie  
Captain will help anyone a friend or a stranger  
Now number one without a gun he's bypassed the lone ranger  
He's a do do good who loves apple pie and kisses little babies  
He'll guard you against everything from atom bombs to rabies  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Can you tell me where I might find my friend and companion  
He looks a little different from anything you've seen  
He likes to beat the bass drum for justice and salvation  
He's got the brains of einstein and the bod of mister clean  
He's a lightnin' flash who'll make the dash from one coast to the other  
To stop a crime or lend a dime or help his aging mother  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Captain america's our man  

Girl of a thousand faces  
From a long line of basket cases  
Daughter of a fortune teller  
Oh the lovely Isabella  
  
CHORUS  
  
She's changing channels  
Stayin' on her toes  
She's just changin' channels  
As she goes  
  
This place is full of beachhead sailors  
Fisherman and old retailers  
Simple lives are so deep seated  
and history always gets repeated  
Some folks see a birds eye view  
Others haven't got a clue  
Some will go and some will stay  
It doesn't matter anyway  
  
CHORUS  
  
They are changin' channels  
Crazy girls and boys  
  
They'll be changin' channels  
Changin' toys  
  
Survivors of tidal waves  
children of former slaves  
strange that they behave  
Like it's another world  
  
There's an island in the ocean  
Where the people stay in motion  
Somewhere on the old gulf stream  
Do they live or did I dream  
  
CHORUS  
  
They were changin' channels  
Waitin' for their sails to fill  
They were changin' channels  
Always will  
  
They'll be changin' channels  
Waitin' for their sails to fill  
They'll be changing channels  
Always will

Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.  
  
Lights are glowing in the palm trees  
Stockings hanging from mast  
Santa's riding on a dolphin  
Don't you want to make it  
Don't you want to make it last.  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.  
  
Sun-tanned children sleeping  
Hoping Santa will come through  
Christmas morning boy they're leaping  
Oh, it's Bubba's Birthday  
Mr Buffett's birthday too!  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.

Meanwhile down on Biel Street  
Drinking in a Biel Street bar  
There's a fog rollin' off the Mississippi  
Has anybody seen Arkansas?  
  
And the deckhands from the toll boats  
Come ashore wearin' Mexican shoes  
They headed strait for Graceland  
It was the first thing they wanted to do  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin' the blues  
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas  
All sportin' Blue suede shoes  
  
Pork pie hats and sombreros  
Hangin' on a downtown street  
Swingin' pool cues at Pinatas  
Don't that river smell sweet?  
  
And they all come to get 'em some Memphis  
A little somethin' for their souls  
'Lone riders land up with limousines  
Hey, they all came to rock and roll  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin' the blues  
Southern belles and Senoritas  
All sportin' Blue suede shoes  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin' the blues  
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas  
All sportin' Blue suede shoes

She's got a ballpark figure  
He's got a ballpoint pen  
Travel around for weeks at a time  
Writin' down descriptions of the places they been  
She plays guitar but nothing fancy  
With no intention of becoming a star  
Only thing that's bothering him these days  
Is where he's gonna find a good ten cent cigar  
  
Cliches, good ways  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
She never did make her debut  
He never made it to class  
She's 86'd from the Chart Room  
He's 29 and pushin' 30 real fast  
They're funny when they get to rockin'  
Goin' out for the night on the town  
Takin' Polaroid pictures that are never in focus  
Just to look at when they finally slow down  
Full moon, so soon  
Wishin' every month of the year could be June  
  
He's always tuned into Star Trek  
She's always tuned into him  
Hidin' his cookies when he gets the munchies  
Tryin' hard just to keep the boy slim  
Tonight they're gonna go star gazing  
And try to figure out which one they're near  
Try as they might I don't think they'll reach the height  
She know you can't get there from here  
  
Full moon, so soon  
Wishin' every month of the year could be June  
Cliches, good ways  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Just say what you mean, mean what you say

Touching down how I climb  
Balancing dreams that he's chosen  
Northern lights on [?]  
Melting stream that was frozen  
  
Passing cars with rusted wheels  
The frame in need of a [?]  
Red sky night, that [?]  
Back when the grow was impossibly  
Working tide will come around again  
[?] is waiting in the wind  
For all your world and treasures  
There's nothing to be want  
Nothing left to measure  
It's you and me and the colour of the sun  
  
While the child wonders how  
The sky connects to the ocean  
Spinning fast, and that's now  
She's unaware of the motion  
The wise men and the fools keep taking turns  
Every day more bridges seem to burn  
With all your volts and treasures  
Would you trade them for some fun?  
What's the rise of pleasure?  
Cause you and me, you can [?]  
Watch the particles collide  
And trust the stars up in the sky!  
  
Sand that's gone, snatched by the storm  
Are the poles really shifting?  
Gypsy rains wash all the planes  
[?] dreams I still drifting  
The best the times get still somehow be found!  
Even the worst of features will never let you down  
For all your world, the treasures  
For your battles lost in one  
Nothing left to measure  
It's you and me and the colour of the sun

Headin' up to San Francisco  
For the Labor Day weekend show,  
I've got my hush-puppies on,  
I guess I never was meant for  
Glitter rock and roll.  
And honey I didn't know  
That I'd be missin' you so.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.  
  
Yes it's been quite a summer,  
Rent-a-cars and west bound trains.  
And now you're off on vacation,  
Somethin' you tried to explain.  
And darlin' I love you so that's  
The reason I just let you go.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.  
  
I can't help it honey,  
You're that much a part of me now.  
Remember the night in Montana when  
We said there'd be no room for doubt.  
  
I hope you're enjoyin' the scenery,  
I know that it's pretty up there.  
We can go hikin on Tuesday,  
With you I'd walk anywhere.  
California has worn me quite thin,  
I just can't wait to see you again.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.

Countin the cows every day  
By: jimmy buffett  
1975  
Oh I'm just a cowboy, an old hired hand  
Never seen nothin majestic or grand  
I just received a great big tax return  
Now I'm off to las vegas with money to burn  
  
Its been a while since I last left this town  
Bought a new suit and I'm nevada bound  
Gonna make it, gonna break it, I've been there before  
Nothins gone wrong, this towns such a bore  
  
Chorus:  
Aw, the train leaves at seven, all go to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah, the train leaves at seven, on up to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
And countin the cows every day

There's a cowboy in the jungle  
And he looks so out of place  
With his shrimp skin boots and his cheap Cheroots  
And his skin as white as paste  
  
Headin' south to Paraguay  
Where the gauchos sing and shout  
Now he's stuck in Porto Bello  
Since his money all ran out  
So he hangs out with the sailors  
Might and day they're raisin' hell  
And his original destination's just another  
Story that he loves to tell.  
  
With no plans for the future  
He still seems in control  
From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide  
He just had to learn to roll.  
  
Roll with the punches  
Play all of his hunches  
Made the best of whatever came his way  
What he lacked in ambition  
He made up with intuition  
Plowing straight ahead come what may.  
  
Steel band in the distance  
And their music floats across the bay  
While American women in muumuus  
Talk about all the things they did today  
And their husbands quack about fishing  
As they slug those rum drinks down  
Discussing who caught what  
and who sat on his butt  
But it's the only show in town.  
  
They're tryin' to drink all the punches  
They all may lose their lunches  
Tryin' to cram lost years into five or six says  
Seems that blind ambition erased their intuition  
Plowin' straight ahead come what may.  
  
I don't want to live on that kind of island  
No, I don't want to swim in a roped off sea.  
Too much for me, too much for me  
I've got to be where the wind and the water are free.  
  
Alone on a midnight passage  
I can count the falling stars  
While the Southern Cross and the satellites  
They remind me of where we are  
Spinning around in circles  
Living it day to day  
And still twenty four hours, maybe sixty good years  
It's still not that long a stay.  
  
We've gotta roll with the punches  
Learn to play all of our hunches  
Makin' the best of whatever comes your way  
Forget that blind ambition  
And learn to trust your intuition  
Plowin' straight ahead come what may.  
And there's a cowboy in the jungle.

Creola in my soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
(CHORUS 1)  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
Fall in love romancing the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
I remember as a child all the happiness and smiles  
That flowed around my grandma's Sunday table  
While Auntie Mae was sayin' grace  
Papa T would sneak a taste  
And catch a funny look from my cousin Mabel  
  
Then daddy'd beat the drum  
The old folks start to hum  
Sing the only songs that we all know  
Ambiance so fine, dancin' drinkin' wine  
Sing about the lifestyle on the bayou  
  
(CHORUS 2)  
Creola in my soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
Fall in love romancin' the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
It's a spicy kind of life  
Cre-o-la  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
(INSTRUMENTAL 2 VERSES)  
  
Well the years have come and gone  
Still the old song lingers on  
I keep it in my heart with fond affection  
Like the family good luck charm  
That keeps away the harm  
Creola's always there for my protection  
  
(CHORUS 3)  
Creola, good for your soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
You fall in love ramancin' the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me

Well now Billy Voltaire was a Piano player, up from Miami way.  
He used to play in the bars, he could should like the stars,  
And the Lady's would pay and pay.  
Well one night, he did wind up  
Playin' in Havana town.  
And nobody knew, least Billy Voltaire that these were his final sounds  
  
He met up with Marita, a dancer in from the coast.  
Half woman, half child, she drove him half wild  
He loved that lady the most.  
Well one night, he did find her  
In the arms of Shrimper Dan  
So Billy pulled out a knife, took poor Danny's life,  
And then he turned his own cold hand.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just a Cuban crime of passion,  
Messy and old fashioned.  
Yeah, that's what the papers did say.  
It's just a Cuban crime of passion,  
Anjejo and knives a slashin'.  
Yeah but that's what the people like to read about,  
Up in America, up in America.  
  
Well they never found Marita,  
Some people say she got ill.  
Billy Voltaire had no one to claim him,  
He was buried on pauper's hill.  
And no one talks about 'em no more,  
It happned just a week ago.  
But people get by and people get high,  
In the tropics, they come in they go.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Up in America

Lyrics by Jimmy Buffett  
Music by Buffett, Kunkel, Guth, P. Mayer, J. Mayer  
I'm a cultural infidel, painting in the dark  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing in the park  
Socrates, hypothesis, the music of Mozart  
I'm a cultural infidel, coming from the heart  
  
Free thinkin', hoodwinkin', unblinkin' man  
Start trouble, burst bubbles, join my caravan  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, I guess it could be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel trying to draw a crowd  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing right out loud  
Philosophy is not for me, laughing is my game  
I'm a cultural infidel, slap me with the blame  
  
Loose cannon, Armageddon, preachers at the door  
Spittin' poison at the boys 'n girls on dance floor  
I hear them in the congress, I see them on TV  
I hope the Inquisition remains a memory  
  
Al'Diablo Picasso, Al'Diablo Manet  
Al'Diablo Fontainebleau, Al'Diable Hemingway  
O'Diab Dr. Thompson, O'Diab St. Joan  
O'Diab Village Paeople, O'Diab Rolling Stones  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, it might as well be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel, believe in common sense  
I'm a cultural infidel, love the present tense  
But we have to keep a look out for those mean old backed-up farts  
I'm a cultural infidel, comin' from the heart  
  
My heart, my heart, mon coeur  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you in Rio, only time will tell  
  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you tomorrow, only time will tell

It's the ways of her father  
If she's gonna change she hasn't done it yet  
And the desert is calling to me  
Run before the final trap is set  
All roads lead to the city  
Where the dudes and the dykes all look the same  
Lady lays out the pattern  
With the parts of her body that seem tame  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Act like a child and I'll respond with my well-rehearsed farewell  
Quoting the verse that you bought but weren't quite prepared to sell  
Saying I think I love you  
Maybe I care  
It's not fair  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
And it's a sore spot when the room's burning hot  
And the desert air just cannot bring you down  
Still the bed's warm but a cold arm  
Keeps me floating inches off the ground  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Go paint your toes wipe you nose and then come to say goodbye  
And all along tell yourself I am wrong if I try  
Crying sorry it's over  
I'm not to blame  
What a game  
Death valley lives now I'm not even sure what really gives  
Ho, ha  

I live on a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even one day if I do  
Well I'll jump up and smile back at you  
I don't even know where we are  
They tell me were circling a star  
Well I'll take their word, I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so it may be so  
  
I'm riding a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even the high must lay low  
But when I do fall I will be glad to go  
Yes when I do fall I will be glad to go

Delaney talks to statues  
As she dances 'round the pool  
She chases cats through roman ruins  
And stomps on big toadstools  
She speaks a language all her own  
That I cannot discover  
But she knows I love her so  
When I tuck her 'neath the covers  
  
Father, daughter  
Down by the water  
Shells sink, dreams float  
Life's good on our boat  
  
Delaney draws me pictures  
She finger paints the sand  
We chase the dogs and hop like frogs  
Then I do my bad handstand  
She's growing up too fast for me  
And asking lots of questions  
Some I know the answers to  
And some I'm looking for suggestions  
  
Father, daughter  
Born by the water  
Surf's up, sun's down  
Life in a beach town  
  
And some of the things I've seen  
Maybe she won't have to see  
But there's a lot I want to pass along  
That was handed down to me  
  
Delaney talks to statues  
As she dances 'round the pool  
She chases cats through Roman ruins  
And stomps on big toadstools  
She speaks a language all her own  
Just a little like her mother  
And she knows I love her so  
When I tuck her 'neath the covers  
  
Father, daughter  
Down by the water  
Shells sink, dreams float  
Life's good on our boat

Hidden in the mountains  
Under the earth and stone  
A cubic mile of perfection  
A treasure no one has known  
  
One man came upon this mother load  
Built himself a thousand room chateau  
  
He's the emperor of diamonds  
Master of the prize  
He's got a hold on happiness  
And all that money can buy  
  
Everyday he lives in fascination  
This is not an everyday temptation  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this, tell me  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
A blessing can become a curse  
If you keep it to yourself  
Your own exaggeration  
Is not so good for your health  
  
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream  
If you take one look behind the shine  
It doesn't always gleam  
  
Everyday he lives in fascination  
This is not an everyday temptation  
  
It way a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
Coal under pressure  
Sparkle of treasure  
Crystalline measure  
Ornamental pleasure  
In the corner of your eye  
Make a grown man cry  
All the seeds you've sown  
  
Greed can crumble castle walls  
Greed can purchase you thrills  
Power is a dangerous thing  
It can maim it can kill  
  
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream  
If you take one look behind the shine  
It doesn't always gleam  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this, tell me  
Who's gonna save you when you're a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz

He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
He's got a pretty girlfriend  
and he flirts behind her back.  
He looks at other women,  
tries to get them in the sack.  
He tells her that he loves her,  
then he doesn't call for days.  
When it comes to bein' a Dickhead,  
he's got a million ways.  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
When he's out drivin' he's a Dickhead in his car.  
When he's out drinkin' he's a Dickhead in the bar.  
When he's at a party he's a Dickhead drinkin' beer.  
He's got to be the winner of " Dickhead Of The Year".  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
If he's got no job he's a Dickhead out of work.  
If he's got no manners he's a Dickhead and a jerk.  
If he's got no money he's a Dickhead with no class.  
If he's got no brains he's a Dickhead and an ass.  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.

Found myself a matchbook  
Beside some hotel bed  
Opened it up and looked inside  
And this is what it said  
  
Get on back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Boneyard full of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
Fly down to Miami  
Get yourself a boat  
Fill it full of suntan oil  
And rent yourself a goat  
  
Ain't no registration  
Ain't no student loan  
You may not learn to read or write  
But you will surely learn to roll them bones  
  
Get on back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Boneyard full of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
They don't rap your knuckles  
If you cut the class  
They just track you through the jungle boy  
Then they kick your ass  
  
It's a different kind of domino theory  
They teach you down in Butler town  
If you lose you buy the booze  
And then the student body all falls down  
  
They can't get back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Fountain of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
Get on back  
  
Make your parents hate you  
Be a big disgrace  
Act just like a domino  
And fall on your face  
  
You can't get back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Fountain of knowledge  
There ain't no graduation from this kind of education  
Back to school  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
Oh, Jan

You can spend all your days in the grind  
Converting your nickles to dimes  
You could stuff all your pockets till they overflow  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
You can say you're too old to be young  
You think you're too smart to be dumb  
But the well seasoned pro knows how long he can go  
Don't you know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
You can sing every song that's been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me it's all both been said and been done  
  
We're just recycled history machines  
Cavemen in faded blue jeans  
It's the unanswered question in each one of us  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
Bridge  
The more we learn the less we know  
What you keep is what you can't let go  
Take it fast or take it slow  
Just one way for you to go  
Don't chu know - let's go now  
  
You can sing every song that's been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me it's not in the race that you run  
It's the outcast in each one of us  
  
Who gets the girl who is too glamorous  
There's no one to deceive, it's just all make believe  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know

Let me tell you now he sips, he quips  
Dreams a lot about sailing ships  
Wants to throw it all away  
Wants to have it back someday  
  
Love's fool, Sears tool  
Wants to win that football pool  
Spend it on some real good grass  
Disappearing oh so fast  
  
Tell my story pain and glory, guess my occupation  
Free and easy, warm and breezy  
Overnight sensation  
  
I got house pets, Lear jets  
Tryin' to learn about bassinets  
Oh Miss Piggy dance with me  
Let me take you to the sea  
  
Dreamsicle, big dill pickle  
High school honeys sure were fickle  
I'll be damned country ham, takes me back to Alabama  
  
Won't you tell my story, pain and glory, guess my occupation  
Free and easy, warm and breezy  
Overnight sensation  
  
Let me tell you now he sips, he quips  
Dreams a lot about sailing ships  
I'll be damned country ham, takes me back to Alabama  
I'll be damned country ham, takes me back to Alabama

(Henry Kapono)  
  
People here and all over the world  
Men, women, boys and pretty girls  
Gather 'round by the seaside, Beach fun and tropic skies  
Diamond head and palm trees, surf riders on the sea  
It's the place to be, it's the place to be  
One the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
  
Music playing happy songs, everybody gets along  
Dancing in the sunshine, groovin' in the good vibe  
Down by the sea, good times will set your free  
Just you and me, this is the place to be  
On the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Having fun underneath the sun, just you and me  
  
Feelin' good and feelin' right, sunset is out of sight  
Another beautiful Hawaiian day, everything's gonna be ok  
Let's get together and do this again  
At the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday

Why is he cussin' and callin' disgustin'  
The city that is now his home  
He never smiles or keeps up with styles  
He is black and he is all alone  
And you ask why he's this way  
Well brother you're too blind to see  
It's cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Get out of the street don't get high on my beat  
Go on home the policeman warns  
Just 'cause you're poor why do you declare war  
I can't help the way that you were born  
Why are they holdin' him down  
He's spending his life on his knees  
'cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Chorus:  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
Ellis got hooked, he got booked and he shook  
In his cold little shivery cell  
While out on the street in that same funky beat  
Mister pusher was doing well  
And ellis junior cries tears his daddy can't see  
'cause ellis dee ain't free like you and me  
Chorus:  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
'cause ellis dee ain't fee like you and me  
No ellis dee ain't free like you and me  

I was thinkin' last night about Elvis  
Day that he died, day that he died  
  
I was thinkin' that night about Elvis  
Day that he died, day that he died  
Just a country boy that combed his hair  
And he put on a shirt his mama made, and went on the air  
  
And he shook it like a chorus girl  
And he shook it like a Harlem queen  
He shook it like a midnight rambler  
Baby, like you never seen, never seen  
  
I was thinkin' that night about Elvis  
Day that he died, day that he died  
How he took it all out of black and white  
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight  
  
And he shook it like a hurricane  
He shook it like to make it break  
And he shook it like a holy roller  
Baby, with his soul at stake, his soul at stake  
  
Alright, shake it  
  
I was thinkin' that night about Elvis  
Day that he died, day that he died  
He was all alone in a long decline  
Thinkin' how happy John Henry was  
That he fell down and died  
  
When he shook it and it rang like silver  
He shook it and it shined like gold  
He shook it and he beat that steam drill  
Baby, well bless my soul, bless my soul  
  
I was thinking last night about Elvis

I have watched as the sun went down  
I have crashed as the room spun around  
Now she's gone, she can't be found  
And I'm down where I've been before  
Sat and watched as she bolts out the door  
Can't explain why the woman's sore  
It's gonna rain some more  
Chorus:  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder if's she's there  
'cause she took every cent of mine  
Paid it all to the pan am line  
Though she's gone, I hope she's fine  
Fly love of mine  
Chorus:  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder if's she's there  
So tally-ho  
Jolly good show  
My woman's gone to england  

"This is a little song called Everlasting Moon about what some people did to
preserve the environment."  
  
The sky revealed the rumor  
In a misty gray cocoon  
Some angry baby-boomers  
Stole the everlasting moon  
  
They found a new location  
Clear and poison free  
In a distant constellation  
Oh, they called it lunacy  
  
[Chorus]  
Hangin' in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
There's a moon you've got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laser-painted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon, everlasting moon)  
  
Back when nature ruled the heavens  
Oh gypsies, fools, and loons  
Were dragged across the ocean  
By that everlasting moon  
  
When it goes from full to crescent  
I move in and out of tune  
It's the envy of the Kremlin  
It's our everlasting moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shinin' in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
There's this moon you've got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laser-painted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon)  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon)

Message in a bottle  
Rhythm of a drum  
Smoke signals and telegraphs  
Make the airwaves hum  
  
But that's all ancient history  
Like bongs and Lincoln Logs  
Now we livin' like the Jet sons  
In a wacky wireless fog  
  
Talkin', squawkin', hawkin'  
Who knows if anybody's gettin' through  
  
Toasters talk to crack berries  
Boston to Bombay  
Teenage schemes and mobile dreams  
As minutes tick away  
  
We act like crazy people  
Talking to ourselves  
Crashing cars in conversation  
Still that shit flies off the shelf  
  
The information superhighways  
Crawled up like a L.A. traffic jam  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
Do you remember dialing up?  
Yes, I remember well  
Now I just can't go anywhere  
Without my sacred cell  
  
I think that I might die  
If I miss anything at all  
Text me, send me an e-mail  
Ring me up, give me a call  
  
I'm ADD on AOL and tryin' to read  
The writing on the wall  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
Now I'm a real jungle jump up, I'm a megahertz man  
I swing from tree to tree on the very latest plan  
On the download and the dropouts  
On every major city across the land  
  
I got my Marley on my ring tone  
Get up, stand up, reach out  
Touch somebody band  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
And I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
And I'm a digital explorer in an analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone

First time I ran  
Was to the end of the block  
I didn't know then  
That it never would stop  
Mow I look around  
And what do I see  
More and more people  
Running faster then me  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
When I fell in love  
For the very first time  
I couldn't keep up  
With that girl of mine  
On a mighty fast track  
She ran like the wind  
And she never looked back  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
Now I've been to England  
And I've been to France  
I've learned to love oysters  
And I know how to dance  
Someday I'll die  
And come back again  
As some little boy  
Just running to win  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
Look in the mirror  
And what do I see  
The gypsy and fool that I always will be  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
These days  
Everybody's on the run

Ramadan is over,  
The new moon's shown her face,  
I'm halfway round the planet,  
In a most unlikely place.  
  
Following my song line  
Past bamboo shacks and shops  
Behind a jitney packed like sardines,  
With bananas piled on top.  
  
I ran away from politics,  
It's too bizarre at home.  
Away I flew, tuned into Blue  
"Maybe Amsterdam or Rome"  
  
Awakened by a stewardess,  
With Spain somewhere below.  
On the threshold of adventure,  
God I do love this job so.  
  
So while I make my move  
On the big board game  
Up and down a Spanish highway,  
Some things remain the same.  
Girls meet boys  
and the boys tease girls  
I'm heading out this morning,  
For the Far Side of the World.  
  
Oh I believe in song lines  
Obvious and not  
I'd ridden them like camels  
To some most peculiar spots.  
  
They run across the oceans  
Through mountains and saloons  
And tonight out to the dessert  
Where I sit atop this dune.  
  
I was destined for this vantage point  
Which is so far from the Sea  
I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery  
  
From Paris to Tunisia  
Casablanca to Dakar  
I was riding long before I flew  
Through the wind and sand and stars.  
  
Caravan  
Ride that hump  
And Timbuktu's a jillion bumps  
Sleeping bags and battle flags  
Are coiled and furled  
That's the way you travel  
To the far side of the world!  
  
A Sunset framed by lightening bolts  
Burns a lasting memory  
And a string of tiny twinkling lights  
adorn the sausage tree.  
While the embers from the log fire  
Flicker, fly, and twirl  
Then drift off toward the cosmos  
From the Far Side of the World.  
Well it's Christmas and my birthday  
and so to that extent  
The Masai not the wise men  
Are circling my tent.  
I teach them how to play guitar  
They show me how to dance  
We have rum from the Caribbean  
And Burgundy from France.  
  
New Year's Eve in Zanzibar  
With Babu and his boys  
High up on the rooftop  
You can relish all the noise.  
  
They are dancing on the tables  
People bouncing like gazelles  
Two 0-0-1 is ushered in  
With air raid horns and bells.  
  
Time to sing time to dance  
Living out my second chance.  
  
Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.  
  
Back at home, it's afternoon  
Six thousand miles away.  
I will still be there when I get through  
Attending this soiree  
  
There are jobs and chores and questions  
And plates I need to twirl,  
But tonight I'll take my chances,  
On the Far Side of the World.  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.

Yes and I can't remember when I slept last  
I do believe I'm driving on the brink  
If I get off this mighty long haul  
Gonna sit right down and buy myself a drink  
Yes and I can't remember when I slept last  
I do believe I'm driving on the brink  
If I get off this mighty long haul  
Gonna sit right down and buy myself a drink  
Yes and I can't remember when I slept last  
I do believe I'm driving on the brink  
If I get off this mighty long haul  
I'm gonna sit right down and buy myself a drink  
Yes and I can't remember when I slept last  
I do believe I'm driving on the brink  
If I get off this mighty long haul  
I'm gonna sit right down and buy myself a drink

Jimmy Buffett  
Fun tickets in my pocket, visions in my brain  
Grand father always told me it I went down  
I might never come back again  
  
I studied the language tapes  
And I read all the books  
Still nothing prepared me for my  
Very First Look  
  
(CHORUS 1)  
It was my First Look  
Baby that's all it took  
Was my First Look  
Around  
  
I think I want to go flyin'  
But I don't want to leave the ground  
So I'll just cruise on my landing gear  
And taxi round Rio town  
Up to the mountain, down to the sea  
Take me to Leblon where the samba queen  
Waits for me  
  
(CHORUS 2)  
It was my First Look  
That's when I swallowed the hook  
On my First Look  
Around  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voce no kier queo insisto  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voca no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)  
  
Six days later I was felling like a missing link  
When my friends told me hey Jimmy  
It must have been the hoodlum drink  
Now it's time for siestas  
And a belly full of rice and beans  
And figure if I'm brave enough  
To repeat the whole crazy scene  
  
(CHORUS 3)  
On my First Look  
That's when I swallowed the hook  
On my First Look around  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voce no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voca no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica

1971  
I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car  
He don't wear no fancy clothes  
He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  

Well, like to explain to you all before,  
I ain't no drinkin' man  
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular  
And I swore I'd never do it again  
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still  
  
While he went in to town to vote  
It was right up on the mountain  
Where the map said it would be  
Friends let me tell you one thing,  
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still  
It stood up on that mountainside  
Like a hugh golden opal  
  
God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens  
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man  
But temptation got the best of me  
And I took a slash  
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat  
Like honey dew vine water  
And I took another slash,  
Took another'n an another'n an another'n  
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit  
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes  
  
Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body  
And a feelin' came over me  
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before  
It was like, like I was in love  
  
In love for the first time, with anything that moved  
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter  
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off  
In my brain sayin' "Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'"  
'Cause I was drunk  
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'  
Commode huggin' drunk  
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man  
  
And that's when I first saw the bear  
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall  
He rambled up over the hill  
Expectin' me to do one of two things,  
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one  
It hung him up  
  
He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear  
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause  
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man  
It hung him up  
  
He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes  
Was a lot redder than his was  
It hung him up  
  
So I approached him, I said "Mr. Bear, I love  
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body  
I know you got a lot of friends over there  
On the other side of the hill  
  
There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear  
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear,  
Pokey the bear  
  
I want you to go back over there tonight  
And tell them I'm feelin' right  
You tell them I love each and everyone of them  
Like a brother and a sister  
  
But if they give me any trouble tonight  
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill"  
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think  
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious  
Well hell I approached him again  
  
I said "Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord  
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it  
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear"  
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw  
And I led him over to the still  
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause  
He's smellin' somethin' good  
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water  
He downed it up right  
  
Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus  
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight  
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n  
For I knew it he downed eight of them  
And commenced to doin' the bear dance  
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt  
It was so simple like the jitter bug  
It plum evaded me  
  
We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar  
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside  
And I laid down and went to sleep  
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams  
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon  
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off  
In the heavens  
  
My buddy the bear was a missin'  
Want to know something else friends and neighbors  
So was that still

Grapefruit  
A bathin' suit  
Chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
  
Drive in  
You guzzle gin  
Commit a little mortal sin  
It's good for the soul  
  
And oh it gets so damn lonely  
When you're on a plane alone  
And if I had the money, honey  
I'd strap you in beside me  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'  
  
Ten speed  
No need  
My pickup gets me where I please  
Chuggin' down the street  
  
But I'll be leavin'  
In a little while  
So close your eyes and I'll  
I'll be back real soon  
  
"Ah, take it Reefers"  
"Ladies choice, Everybody dance"  
"Here we go"  
  
Yes and if I had that money, honey  
I'd strap you in beside me (in your strapless)  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'  
  
Grapefruit  
A bathin' suit  
You chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
Yeah you chew a little Juicy Fruit  
It's good for ya soul

Apple fall out of the tree and hit the ground  
Pretty soom we realize we're earthly bound  
Babies fall and babies cry in early years  
Mamas dust them off and wipe away the tears  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ohhhhhhhh watch out for that gravity storm  
It don't give no warning signs  
Ohhhhhhhh watch out for that gravity storm  
Ohhoo  
  
All your life you have to deal with ups and downs  
So listen to your heartstrings as you move around  
Don't forget to listen to the steady beat  
Don't forget to balance on your ready feet  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter in the storm  
All your life  
I well keep you warm  
Shelter from the storm  
All your life  
  
Apple fall out of the tree and hit the ground  
Pretty soon we realize we're earthly bound  
Babies fall and babies cry in early years  
Mamas dust them off and wipe away the tears  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter in the storm  
All your life  
I will keep you warm  
Shelter from the storm  
All your life

I ain't no video king  
I still have to sing  
For my supper each night  
  
You stand on the benches  
I play in the trenches  
Beneath the big spotlights  
Lived in a suitcase for half of my years  
I got strange little voices that live in my ears  
Hall monster, mall monster  
I can't be the old me no more  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Homemade music down in the passion pits  
Homemade music lots o grits but no hits  
Homemade music is part of my philosophy  
  
Oh cooking is a pleasure  
And singing is a treasure  
That most don't' find  
  
There ain't' no harm in telling  
I like to eat my melon right  
Down to the rind  
  
I had a hippy girlfriend when I was a kid  
She died and went to the suburbs most of them did  
Where did all the wild ones go  
  
Homemade music ain't on the radio  
Homemade music searching high and low  
Homemade music where did all the good songs go  
  
First there were records, then cassettes and CDs  
Managers, lawyers, then came the Japanese  
But homemade music still makes a lot of sense to me  
  
Homemade music is funky and nice  
Homemade music sits on very thin ice  
But homemade music is part of my philosophy  
  
Homemade music ain't on the radio  
Homemade music searching high and how  
Homemade music where did all the good songs go

You never try to keep the wild ones home  
But mister don't just sit there and wait  
Go out on the town makin' all of the rounds  
It don't matter if you're your own date  
  
Vacantly occupied, sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin' of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I can't pronounce my are's or g's when I'm speakin' Southerneese  
Honey do, Honey, come and do me again  
  
I've seen your fat cats style  
Three hundred pounds of jive ass smile  
Young girls gigglin' all the while  
That's not my cup of chowder  
  
I go for candlelight  
Cold champagne nearly every night  
Honey, do a little toast to me and you  
  
Honey, why couldn't you have taken the non stop train  
I'm hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
I know it's gettin' late  
Waiter keeps starin' at your empty plate  
Maitre'd keeps tellin' me  
"Sir, she's just not coming."  
  
Now what the hell does Garcon know  
We've been through all this before  
Honey do, Honey, come and do me again  
  
Honey, why couldn't you have taken the non stop train?  
I'm hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
Vacantly occupied, sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin' of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I can't pronounce my are's or g's when I'm speakin' Southerneese  
Honey do, Honey come and do me again  
Yeah, Honey do, Honey come and do me again.

She owns a window to the ocean  
She has a pipeline to the sky  
But earthly creatures rarely notice  
When guardian angels pass them by  
  
Like a gecko behind a painting  
With hidden wisdom to impart  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's a hula girl at heart  
  
Photograph shows, she is lovely  
Her bare feet are a work of art  
Her fragrance speaks of Frangipanni  
Yes, she's still a hula girl at heart  
  
With her pen and watercolors  
Drawing fish and butterflies  
Children always seem to conjure  
Images they recognize  
  
In the land beside the ocean  
Where romantics seem to dwell  
Destiny can set in motion  
Ripples that turn into swells  
  
She knows how to face the music  
She knows where the magic starts  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart  
  
Song sing slow  
Days gone by  
Time can't keep her  
Nor can I  
  
She has worn a wealth of costumes  
Hula skirts to wedding gowns  
Lived in cities walked through jungles  
Always sees the sun go down  
  
In this age of teeming tourists  
Fellow travelers know her well  
The darling of deserted beaches  
Adds her rhythms in a shell  
  
Her sensual and easy motion  
Seems impossible to chart  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart

1970  
It's never been the same since you returned from dreamin'  
With your nursery rhyme excuses your picture postcards gleamin'  
Tellin' everyone who looks your way 'bout people and their sinnin'  
While you left field verse is fallin' in proportion to your winnin'  
And I can't be your hero today  
I'm through with the simple games you play  
It just may take some time for me to even up the score  
But I can't be your soldier home from war  
And there you sit shouting that there's still hope for us  
While nature holds the handcuffs on a capricorn and taurus  
There's nothing you can do or say to get me to your camp  
Go fill up all your savings books and buy yourself a lamp  
And I can't be your hero today  
Your wholesale price is much to high to pay  
A bargain basement atmosphere is no way to sell love  
And I can't be your superman above  
No I can't be your hero today  
That is all I really want to say  
Go find a leading man who wants to play  
And I can't be your hero today  

Why does the sunset in the west?  
And why does my heart keep beating in my chest?  
What ever happened to the Duke of Earl?  
I got a PBS mind in a MTV world.  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hey, I don't know, I don't care.  
  
Ambivalent, well, yes and no.  
Hey where did all the hippies go?  
Our conversation sounds like actors' lines.  
Is it time for your medication or mine?  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hey I don't know, I don't care.  
  
Therapy is extremely expensive.  
Poppin' bubblie wrap is radically cheap.  
You choose which one helps with your problem.  
I'm gonna get some sleep.  
I'm gonna get some sleep.  
  
Sandy beaches in distant reaches  
And oh those lovely Georgia peaches.  
It's never too much and never too late  
To pack your bags and get out of state.  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
The worried will all disagree.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hell, I don't know and I don't care.  
  
If you're looking for a quote from me  
I'll be under the mango tree.  
Just can't say how I'll get there  
Hey, I don't know and I don't care.  
I don't know and I don't' care.  
I don't know and I don't care.  
At his beach house on the moon

Jimmy Buffett  
The days drift by  
They don't have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there are so many quiet places  
And smilin' eyes match the smilin' faces.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I have found me a home  
Yes, I have found me a home  
And you can have the rest of everything I own  
'Cause I have found me a home.  
  
My old red bike  
Gets me around  
To the bars and the beaches of my town  
And there aren't many reasons I would leave  
Yes, I have found me some peace.  
  
And the ladies aren't demanding there  
They never ask too much  
And when you're coming off a cold love  
That's sure a nice warm touch.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The days drift by  
They don't have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there aren't many reasons I would leave  
Yes, I have found me some peace  
Yes, I have found me a home.

Came to see friends  
Walk old streets again  
Grab a bite and beer by the sea  
It caught my attention  
The old town has grown  
That's why I came alone  
  
But I've been treated well  
I raised all kinds of hell  
When a full tank was only a fin  
Ain't it quite funny how things turn around  
I heard I was in town  
  
I was a madman in a pickup truck  
So many years ago  
Changes have come like the storms of the season  
But time here still moves slow  
Passed the old joints  
My favorite haunts  
Where we'd stay for twelve or ten  
Ain't it quite funny word gets around  
I heard I was in town  
  
I was a madman in a pickup truck  
So many years ago  
Changes have come like the storms of the season  
But time here still moves slow  
  
Came to see friends  
Walk old streets again  
Maybe strike up a tune with the moon  
Don't it seem funny  
Word gets around  
I heard I was in town  
  
SOMEWHERE OVER

I had Cadillac's in my future  
Debutantes in my past  
I made a deal with the devil for a whole lot of money  
Thinkin' it would last and last  
But a fool and his money are bound to part  
And what goes up must come down  
So take my advice, don't trust the roll of the dice  
Keep your feet on solid ground  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Lots of women and wine  
But who's gonna tell a fool? Who's gonna tell a fool?  
Who's gonna tell a fool? That he ain't cool  
  
Now thems were hard times back in the eighties bous  
People barely had enough to get by  
But oh not me foot loose and fancy free  
There was nothing to myself I'd deny  
So fellas listen to my story now  
Though you have heard this tale befo'  
Take care of your needs and watch out for your greeds  
Or that wolf will be at your door  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Now I ain't got a dime  
But who's gonna be the fool? Who's gonna be the fool?  
Who's gonna be the fool? It still ain't cool.  
  
Who's gonna tell a fool? Who's gonna tell a fool?  
Who's gonna tell a fool? It still ain't cool

I don't smoke, I don't shoot smack  
But I got a spicy monkey ridin' on my back.  
Don't eat beignets, too much sugar and dough,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo  
  
It started at my Grandma's kitchen by the sea,  
She warned me when she told me "son the first one's free"  
It hit me like a rock or some Taikwondo,  
Cause I will play for gumbo  
Oh yea, I will play for gumbo.  
Chorus  
A piece of French bread  
With which to wipe my bowl,  
Good for the body.  
Good for the soul.  
It's a little like religion  
And a lot like sex.  
You should never know  
When you're gonna get it next.  
At midnight in the quarter or noon in Thibadeaux  
I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo.  
  
I'm not talkin' quesadillas or a dozen Krispy Kremes,  
Or a pound of caviar that's a rich man's dream.  
No banana split or fillet of pompano.  
No, I will play for gumbo,  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
Chorus  
Maybe it's the sausage or those pretty pink shrimp  
Or that popcorn rice that makes me blow up like a blimp.  
Maybe it's that voodoo from Marie Leveaux,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
  
The sauce boss does his cookin' on the stage,  
Stirrin' and a singing for his nightly wage.  
Sweating and frettin' from his head to his toe,  
Playin' and swayin' with the gumbo  
Prayin' and buffetin' with the gumbo  
Chorus

The place down the block, the one  
with no clock  
Covert rendezvous with you at the  
usual time  
I savor the scent of the fish on  
the grill  
Life's so spicy up on bar-be -q-hill  
  
Lookin' good, you look so fine  
Waiter bring us one more bottle of wine  
  
CHORUS  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day one big afternoon  
We'll begin with dessert a little coconut tart  
Mmmm tastes as sweet as a piece of your heart  
Cafe au lait beneath the Paris moon  
  
Don't hide you eyes just wear your disguise  
Brazil's in the air I swear it feels like Mardi Gras time  
I savor the scent love that Anik Goutal  
As we walk in time to the cathedral bell  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day a first time love affair  
We'll begin with a kiss, such a warm place to start  
Let me into your life, let me into your heart  
Mea culpa mea culpa carnival's in the air

If I could just get it on paper  
The things that have happened tonight  
But that seems to me to be the big key  
I'm having too good a time to ever turn  
Out the lights.  
  
Go to bed wake up with a clear head  
Recalling what made it a ball  
If I could just get it on paper  
I might make some sense of it all  
  
If I could tell half of the stories  
The funny way most things begin  
Figure ways to disguise all the half truths and lies  
Find the heart of my song with the point of a pen  
Simple words can be come clever phrases  
And chapters could turn into books  
Yes if I could just get it on paper  
But it's harder than it ever looks.  
  
All alone in the edge of the water  
Hiding out by the Sea of Cortez  
With my sketch pads and Flairs  
Tapes and battery spares  
  
It's just no comprehend to what everyone says  
  
Time alone seemed to work well for Faulkner  
Time away seems to work for the kid  
Life and ink they run out at the same time  
Or so said my old friend the squid  
  
Yes if I could just get it on paper tonight  
I could tell you what I think I did.

I never wanted to be  
A man of mystery  
My life's an open book  
by James Joyce and Agatha Christie  
  
Sometimes I get confused  
Somewhere around page two  
I live the perfect crime  
And crime pays more than it used to  
  
They're checkin' the evidence  
May be come charges pressed  
The only one they got me on  
is some misdemeanor craziness  
  
(CHORUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I hae had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I hve had my fund I have bought a few rounds  
And been out on the town way out on the town  
Way way way out If It All Falls Down  
  
Never wanted to be  
A part of history  
I have my days in the sun  
A beach bum a man for all sea sides  
Guidance counselor said  
Your scores are anti-heroic  
Computer recommends  
Hard-drinking calypso poet  
  
Studied life at sea  
Studied life in bars  
Never passed my S.A.T.'s  
So I thought I'd study extra hard  
  
(CHROUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I have learned my trade from the inside out  
I can strum real hard I can play real loud  
I can charm a crowd If It All Falls Down  
  
If It all Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can warm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
We had plenty of doctors  
We had plenty of lawyers  
We had people to make us things  
We had people to sell us those things  
We didn't have enough room for those things  
We build lots of self storage  
Calypso poet shortage  
Calypso poet shortage  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I'll have filled that void from city to town  
I'll have spent my money and taken my bows  
I'll have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd till they snake danced round  
With calypso beat down island sound  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down

Jimmy Buffett, Will Jennings, Michael Utley  
There are oceans of feelings between us  
Currents that take us and sweep us away  
That's why we seldom have seen us  
In the light of a cold hard day  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old answers  
Open your eyes, you might see  
Of our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that it's me  
I'll be out in the eye of the storm  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that I'll be  
Where someone can make me feel warm  
It's too bad we can't turn  
And live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
I've had good days and bad days  
And going half mad days  
I try to let go but you're still on my mind  
I've lost all the old ways  
I'm searching for new plays  
Putting it all on the line  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old problems  
Open your eyes, you might see  
If our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If it takes all the future  
We'll live through the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me

In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
"What is it all about? I just don't know,  
But I can't go back home."  
  
Lonely princess, all the days out  
On your own are growing empty.  
Nothin' is goin' well, if you  
Could only tell them how you feel.  
But they're too real to understand.  
  
Too many trite expressions ending in  
Forced rejection long ago.  
Too many innocent faces in too many  
Far-out places, something's wrong.  
  
Let me tell you that something's wrong.  
It's been that way so long, and it's a shame.  
  
On the street car to the city,  
Where she knows that she may lose it all,  
Riding for just a dime,  
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well  
That this could be her final fall,  
Past the boutique, to the alley,  
Down the river, people pass her by.  
She sits on the big gray rocks,  
Takes off her boots and socks,  
Not knowing what she will do next,  
Just starts to cry.  
  
To many wild rejections ending in  
Angry questions from her dad.  
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone  
Loves a winner, but she was lost.  
No ones knows the trials she had.  
  
In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
"What is it all about? I just  
Don't know, but I can't go back home."  
Hell, I just don't know, but  
I can't go back home.

Travis McGee's still in Cedar Key  
That's what John McDonald said  
My rendezvous so long overdue  
With all of the things I've sung and read  
They still apply to me, they all make sense in time  
  
Chorus  
But now I'm incommunicado  
Driving by myself down the road with a hole in it  
Songs with no vibrato  
Takin' the long way home  
  
Now on the day that John Wayne died  
I found myself on the continental divide  
Tell me where do we go from here?  
Think I'll ride into Leadville and have a few beers  
Think of "Red River","Liberty Valence" can't believe the old man's gone  
  
Chorus  
But now he's incommunicado  
Leaving such a hole in a world that believed  
That a life with such bravado  
Was taking the right way home  
  
So when I finished the last line  
I put the book by itself on the shelf  
With my heart in it  
Never wasting time takin' the right way home  
I know you're never wastin' time  
Findin' the right way home  
  
Still I am incommunicado  
Livin' next door to a leg with a pin in it  
Never wastin' time, takin' the right way home  
(Repeat)

Island I see you in the distance  
I feel that your existence  
Is not unlike my own  
Island they say no man is like you  
They say you stand alone  
Sometimes I feel that way too  
  
Is it the need for love?  
Heart and soul accompaniment  
That seems to make me different from you  
  
Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports  
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters  
Tore my sails and broke my oars.  
  
Island I see you in the moonlight  
Silhouettes of ships in the night  
Just make me long that much more  
Island I see you in all of my dreams  
But I'm a man with no means to reach your distant shore  
  
When the need for love  
Heart and soul accompaniment  
That seems to make me different from you  
  
I've tried to build bridges  
But they all fell down  
I've taken to the air on wings of silver  
But always hit the ground  
  
Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports  
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters  
Tore my sails and broke my oars.  
  
Island I see you in the moonlight  
Silhouettes of ships in the night  
Just make me long that much more

[Alan Jackson]  
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow and so am I  
Work day passes like molasses in winter time, but it's July.  
Getting paid by the hour and older by the minute.  
My boss just pushed me over the limit.  
I could call him something, think I'll just call it a day.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane  
It's only half past twelve  
But I don't care it's five o'clock somewhere  
  
[Alan Jackson]  
This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon, half the night  
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be h-e-l-l to pay  
But hey that's all right  
I ain't had a day off now, in over a year  
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here  
If the phone's for me you can tell them I just sailed away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Alan Jackson]  
I could pay off my tab, pour myself  
In a cab and be back to work before two.  
At a moment like this, I can't help  
But wonder what would Jimmy Buffett do.  
  
[Jimmy Buffett]  
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say  
Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane  
It's only half past twelve but I don't care.  
  
[Chorus - Both Sing]  
  
[Alan]  
But he don't care, I don't care.  
  
[Jimmy]  
It's five o'clock somewhere.  
  
[Dialog]  
Jimmy: What time zone am I on? What country am I in?  
Alan: It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere.  
Jimmy: It's always on time for Margarita ville. Come to think of it.  
Alan: I heard that.  
Jimmy: You've been there haven't ya?  
Alan: Yes sir!  
Jimmy: I've seen your boat there.  
Alan: I've been to Margarita ville a few times.  
Jimmy: Alright, that's good.  
Alan: Stumbled on my way back.  
Jimmy: Okay, well I just want to make sure you keep it between the
navigational beacons.  
Alan: Ha ha ha! Keep it between the buoys. I got it!  
Jimmy: Alright, well it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere.  
Alan: I'm ready. Crank it up!  
Jimmy: Let's get out of here.  
Alan: I'm gone!

I've got a question for you  
Please grant me an interview  
Don't want to read it in a magazine  
Don't want to see it on the silver screen  
Don't let the craziness tear us apart  
  
I'm down on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
This comes from deep in my soul  
Your sweet love has taken control  
I'll swim across the ocean if you tell me so  
I'll take you to the jump up if you want to go  
It never is too late to make a brand new start  
  
I'm down here on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
Oh how I will sing if you give me everything  
I live for the day when there's nothing in our way  
  
I will be waiting tonight  
You'll find my boat by the light  
I'm gonna show you what my love can do  
Out on the ocean all alone with you  
We'll find a desert island on an ancient chart  
  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart

They can can come take it all away  
Break your heart in the light of day  
Drown your love in a distant bay  
So lonely  
See the ship heading for the rocks  
  
See the time melting off the clocks  
There's a light shattering all the locks  
And saves me  
It saves me  
  
That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante  
On the night wind that takes me just where I want  
That's all I want La Vie Dansante  
Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante  
On the night wind that takes you just where you want  
That's all you'll want La Vie Dansante  
  
Miss the beat if you close your eyes  
Every night wears a new disguise  
And I live when a new surprise surrenders  
  
Feel it all with a willing heart  
Every stop is a place to start  
If you know how to play the part with feeling  
I play with feeling

Jimmy Buffett  
What could I do?  
That's never been done before  
What can I say?  
That hasn't been said by scores  
  
If I was a designer I could do nothing finer  
Than dress you in style  
But I'm a hopeless romantic still  
Behind all these antics  
Is a heart full of smiles  
  
So I'll just keep on dreamin'  
The thoughts that are in my brain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
  
I know that I've  
The imagination of a child  
And there are times  
When I let it all run wild  
  
But if I hurt, you forgive  
Still you won't let me live  
Some of those episodes down  
  
That's why I love you  
And put no one above you  
Love your sights and your sounds  
  
So I'll just keep on movin'  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
  
So I'll just keep on movin'  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
Yes I love you  
Put no one above you  
You're the lady I can't explain

Verse  
NORDSTROM WAS A SIMPLE MAN  
WHO HATCHED A NON-CONFORMIST PLAN TO SAVE HIS ASS  
EVERY NIGHT HE DANCED ALONE  
AND BLOTTED OUT THE MONOTONE THAT WAS HIS PAST  
HE PACKS HIS BAG OF MYSTERIES  
AND LEAVES THE LONELY MEMORIES WHERE THEY BELONG  
THEY CAME AND WENT SO EASILY  
THIS RISING TIDE IDENTITY, SINGS LIKE A SONG  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
  
Verse  
IN THE ROLL OF COSMIC DICE  
YOU WIN ONE HEART AND LOSE IT TWICE, BEFORE YOU KNOW  
LOVE IS FINE UNTIL YOU TASTE  
THIS MELANCHOLY BOUILLABAISSE CALLED LETTING GO  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
  
Verse  
HE MOVED ON UP TO OLD BEAN TOWN  
AND SUMMERED ON THE VINEYARD SOUND, TO PASS THE DAY  
ISLAND HOPPING, CRAB CAY BOUND  
TENDING BAR HE THINKS HE'S FOUND A BETTER WAY  
NOW WERE BACK WHERE WE BELONG  
WITHOUT A CLUE AND STILL WITHOUT A MASTER PLAN  
INCIDENT OR ACCIDENT  
IT ALL DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE MEANT TO UNDERSTAND  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME

Promenade dans un bois la vielle Louisiane  
Les ombres lougnes nos pas silents  
l'air de la Louisiane  
Toi et moi ne parlant pas  
en sucant d'la canne  
Pour un instant je suis content en  
l'air de la Louisiane  
Pour un instant je suis content en  
l'air de la Louisiane  
  
English Lyric  
A walk in the woods of old Louisiana  
the shadows are long  
Our steps are silent in the Louisiana air  
You and I say nothing as we suck sugar cane  
For one minute I'm happy in the Louisiana air

If they gave Olympic medals  
For rocking all night long  
I would have won em all till I turned pro  
I had years of dedication  
And a natural inclination  
And a childhood game I just could not outgrow  
  
I want to be the last man standing  
People crashing on the sofas and passed out on the floor  
But the last man standing  
Was saying bring on a little bit more  
  
When you stop and think about it  
Life is still just high school  
You make the same mistakes you did when you were young  
Contending for the ladies' favors  
Tasting every single flavor  
While hopelessly trying not to scald your tongue  
  
I want to be the last man standing  
People crashing on the sofas and passed out on the floor  
But the last man standing  
Was saying bring on a little bit more  
  
I might as well admit it  
There's been a time or two  
When I contemplated retiring for a while  
But a hundred years from now  
They'll still be asking how  
As they gaze upon my taxidermic smile  
  
Want to be the last man standing  
Got the devil at the crossroads, wolf at the door  
But the last man standing  
Is singing bring on a little bit more  
  
They're gonna see the last man standing  
Still got a fun ticket in my hand  
Gonna be the last man standing  
Taking off before I land

I went down to Captain Tony's  
To get out of the heat  
I heard a voice call out to me  
"Son come have a seat"  
I had to search my memory  
As I looked into those eyes  
Our lives changed like the weather  
But a legend never dies  
  
[Chorus]  
He said I ate the last mango in Paris  
I took the last plane out of Saigon  
Took the first fast boat to China  
And Jimmy there's still so much to be done  
I had a third world girl in Buzios  
With a pistol in each hand  
  
She always kept me covered  
As we moved from land to land  
I had a damn good run on Wall Street  
With my high fashion model wife  
I woke up dry beneath the African sky  
Just me and my Swiss Army knife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We shot the breeze for hours  
As the sun fell from the sky  
And like the sun he disappeared  
Before my very eyes  
It was somewhere past dark-thirty  
As I went back to the head  
I read upon the dingy walls  
The words the old man said  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Work, work, work  
Big pile of it and the boss is a jerk.  
I just want to disappear  
Wishin' I was somewhere other than here.  
  
Livin' for the weekend,  
Jumpin' off the deep end,  
With just enough money to buy  
A license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
A little bit of money, the night's still young  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
Girls, girls, girls  
Ain't nothin' like them in the whole wide world.  
So damn smart and cute,  
And it's amazing what they pass off as a bathing suit.  
Winners and losers  
Sailors and cruisers  
We're all qualified, for a license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
A little bit of money, the night's still young  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
License to chill  
And I believe I will  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
One good song will last all night long  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
A license to chill  
  
Ramos go rent me a coupe Deville  
Hey KL, where's that barbecue grill  
Head on down to Margaritaville  
Have me a cheeseburger with a big pickle dill  
Jesus, I sound kinda mentally ill  
I guess I better go turn on Dr Phil

He took one last look  
Tossed that address book  
His odyssey had begun  
No time to see sights  
Ran all the red lights  
Burned all his bridges  
Now it's love on the run  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
Is takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Up on the bandstand, plays for a few fans  
Workin' for minimum wage  
He sees her lookin', his brain is cookin'  
She takes her seat of the foot of the stage  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
It's takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Yeah he loves livin' it up  
And takin' all of he's time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It never crosses his mind  
  
Didn't say much, had a soft touch  
Knew what felt good in her man  
He was the same way, they split the next day  
Sang all the way through the Yucatan  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
It's takin' all of our taime  
But we ain't givin' it up  
It never crosses our mind  
No no no he's just livin' it up  
And takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' her up  
She suits his temperament fine  
Yeah she's just livin' it up  
And takin' all of his time.

You got your Tony Lamas on your jeans pressed tight  
Take a few tokes make you feel alright  
Rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
Pickup's washed and you just got paid  
With any luck you might even get laid  
Cause they're making and they're breaking  
On a Livingston Saturday night  
  
You got to listen to the sound of the hot country band  
Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand  
Sing a song play some pong, shoot a little pool  
Hitting on the honeys right out of high school  
Fifteen may get you twenty, that's all right  
Cause they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
  
Oh listen to the sound of the hot country band  
Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand  
Hum a song play some pong, eat a deviled egg  
Temperature is rising better pop another keg  
Fifteen may get you twenty, that's all right  
Cause they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
  
Yeah I said they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
One more time they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  

My garden is filled with papayas and mangos  
My life is a mixture of reggaes and tangos  
Taste for the good life, I can live it no other way  
  
While out on the beach there are two empty chairs  
That say more than the people who ever sit there  
From under my lone palm I can look out on the day  
  
Where no bird flies by my window  
No ship is tied to my tree  
Love is a wave building to a crescendo  
Ride if you will, ride it with me  
  
I knew this girl made of memories and phrases  
Who lived her whole life in both chapters and stages  
Danced til the dawn, wished all her worries away  
  
Well she wasn't crazy no she wasn't mad  
She just wanted the father that she never had  
From under my lone palm I think about her today  
  
We sailed from the port of indecision  
Young and wild with oh so much to learn  
Days turn into years as we tried to fool our fears  
But to the port of indecision I returned  
  
My gardens are filled with papayas and mangos  
My life is a mixture of jingles and jangles  
Come Christmas winds and blow all my worries away  
  
Sing if you will and we'll sing to the sea

Better days are in the cards, I can feel it  
Feel it in the changing winds, feel it when I fly  
So talk to me. I will listen to your story  
Been around enough to see there's more than meets the eye  
  
Everybody needs a little good luck charm  
A little gris-gris keeps us safe from harm  
Rub yours on me and I'll rub mine on you  
Luckiest couple on the avenue  
  
With little love and luck we will get by  
With a little love and luck we'll take the sky  
In this megalo-modern world you've got to try  
Try a little love and luck, you will get by  
  
Mysteries - don't ever try to change them  
We're just players in this game and no one's keeping score  
So have your fun, go ahead and tell your story  
Find yourself a lover who will glue you to the floor  
  
Everybody needs a little good luck charm  
A little gris-gris keeps us safe from harm  
Rub yours on me and I'll rub mine on you  
Luckiest couple on the avenue  
  
With a little luck we will get by  
With a little love and luck we'll take the sky  
In this megalo-modern world you've got to try  
Try a little love and luck, you will get by  
  
Kole sere (4x)  
  
repeat chorus

Left one in the drizzling rain  
Found one on the morning plane  
Leaving out his well-known line  
Bought her some gin - that did her in  
Now they're making love behind the occupied sign  
  
Chorus  
Just a living example of love in decline  
Looking so hard and so little time  
Going ninety to nothing and flying stone blind  
Just a living example of love in decline  
  
Miami hotel disco bar  
He asked if she's a movie star  
Her eyes light and up - they're going far  
No time for a room it happened to soon  
Now they're making love in her rental car  
Just a living example of love in decline

On the corner of Government and Bay Avenue  
The old doomsday fanatic wore a crown of kudzu  
Sirens where wailing in the gulf coastal heat  
And it seemed like the whole world was in forced retreat  
I paid no attention, revolved through the door  
Passed the newspaper rack on the worn marble floor  
Near civil war history my heart skipped a beat  
She was standing on fiction stretched high on bare feet  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
I was the pirate and she was the queen  
Sir Francis and Elizabeth the best there's ever been  
Then she strolled past my table and stopped at the stairs  
Then sent me a smile as she reached for Flaubert  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
She gathered her books, walked while she read  
Words never spoken but so much was said  
You can read all you want into this rendezvous  
But it's safer than most things that lovers can do  
Well stories have endings and fantasies fade  
The guard by the door starts drawing the shade  
So write your own ending and hope they come true  
For the lovers and strangers on Bay Avenue  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time

Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser?  
Take my hand, don't turn away  
You've been sitting there all night long  
I know that something must be wrong  
  
Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser?  
A new moon has come out to play  
Take my hand, step outside  
These doors and windows open wide  
  
The stars are out and shining, hear the south wind sighing  
It'll be okay  
Let the breeze caress you,  
Violin undress your heart  
On va danser  
  
Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser?  
It will soon be the break of day  
We all have so little time  
Oh won't you put your hand in mine  
  
The stars are out and shining, hear the south wind sighing  
It'll be okay  
Let the breeze caress you,  
Violin undress your heart  
I swear, on va danser  
  
Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser?  
A new moon has come out to play  
Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser  
It will soon be the break of day  
On va danser  
On va danser  
  
Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser  
Madamoiselle, voulez vous danser  
Danser  
We all have so little time

When I woke up this morning  
I was tired as I could be  
I think I was counting my money  
When I should have been counting sheep  
  
My agent he just called me  
And told me what I should be  
If I would make my music for money  
Instead of making music for me  
  
[Chorus]  
I said I know that this may sound funny  
But money don't mean nothin' to me  
I won't make my music for money, no  
I'm gonna make my music for me  
  
He said that people only buy the love songs.  
Rock and roll is not too long  
He said son you got to be commercial  
If you want to turn the people on.  
  
And I said turning on the people  
Now that's a beautiful place to be  
But if I spend my time makin' memorable rhyme  
Well who's gonna turn on me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now, I went up the country  
And I'll tell you all about the scene  
I found a place with much charm and much grace  
That was untouched by the music machine  
Well the people where havin' a good time  
Makin' music all day long  
And nobody cared if they ever got paid  
One penny for playin' a song

If necessity is the mother of invention  
Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this  
The numbers come together in some kind of a third dimension  
A regular algebraic bliss.  
  
Let's start with something simple, like one and one ain't three  
Any two plus two will never get you five.  
There are fractions in my subtraction and x don't equal y  
But my homework is bound to multiply.  
  
Math suks math suks  
I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much.  
Math suks math suks  
Sometimes I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
I got so bored with my homework, I turned on the TV.  
The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth.  
Then they asked the new Miss America  
Hey babe can you add up all those bucks?  
She looked puzzled, then just said  
"Math Suks".  
  
Math suks math suks  
You don't even have to spell it,  
All you have to do is yell it  
Math suks math suks  
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
Geometry, trigonometry and if that don't tax your brain  
There are numbers to big to be named  
Numerical precision is a science with a mission  
And I think it's gonna drive me insane.  
  
Parents fighting with their children, and the Congress can't agree  
Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly.  
Management and labor keep rattling old sabers  
Quacking like those Peabody ducks.  
  
Math suks math suks  
You don't even have to spell it,  
All you have to do is yell it  
Math suks math suks  
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.

I went out fishing on a sandy beach  
Cast my line out as far as it would reach  
Looking for something from the frying pan  
I kick back with a beer in my hand  
  
I must've got a big one cause it's bending my pole  
I'm having to fight just to keep my hold  
It could be a whale (oh) God only knows  
Whatever it is it's not wearing any clothes  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water  
She's covered in green  
She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life  
She's a mermaid in the night  
  
She's got a set of gills, like no fish I've ever seen  
Long blonde hair and a tail in between  
I'm in love with a creature from the sea  
And she's bringin' out the crustacean in me  
  
Her voice is a temptation it's a siren song  
When we kiss there could be no wrong  
I ask her to marry me, to be my wife  
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water  
She's covered in green  
She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life  
She's a mermaid in the night

Verse  
WAY DOWN HERE  
YOU NEED A REASON TO MOVE  
FEEL A FOOL  
RUNNIN' YOUR STATE SIDE GAME  
LOSE YOUR LOAD  
LEAVE YOUR MIND BEHIND, BABY JAMES  
  
Chorus  
OH MEXICO  
IT SOUNDS SO SIMPLE  
I JUST GOT TO GO  
THE SUN'S SO HOT  
I FORGOT TO GO HOME  
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW  
  
Verse  
AMERICANO'S GOT THE SLEEPY EYES  
BUT HIS BODY'S STILL SHAKEN LIKE A LIVE WIRE  
SENIORITA WITH HER EYES ON FIRE, DON'T YOU KNOW  
  
Chorus  
OH MEXICO  
IT SOUNDS SO SWEET  
WITH THE SUN SINKIN' LOW  
THE MOONS SO BRIGHT  
LIKE TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT  
MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT  
  
Verse  
BABYS HUNGRY  
AND THE MONEY'S ALL GONE  
THE FOLKS BACK HOME  
DON'T WANT TO TALK ON THE PHONE  
SHE GETS A LONG LETTER  
SENDS BACK A POST CARD  
TIMES ARE HARD  
  
Chorus  
OH DOWN IN MEXICO  
I NEVER REALLY BEEN  
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW  
OOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW  
OOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN  
BUT I'D SURE LIKE TO GO  
WOOOOHHHHHH MEXICO  
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO NOW

I guess it all blew up in Missoula  
There just was no other way  
After months of going crazy  
There was nothing left to say  
But when the dust had finally settled  
And the air had quickly cleared  
Things were better off than I had feared  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
Feelin' so sad now since I been gone  
Gone, gone  
And it gets quite confusin'  
It seems that I'm loosin' track of  
The long days since I been home  
  
Were stayin' in a Holiday Inn full of surgeons  
I guess they meet there once a year  
They exchange physician stories  
And get drunk on Tuborg beer  
Then they're off to catch a stripper  
With their eyes glued to her G  
But I don't think that I would ever let them cut on me  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
I think I been had tho, for stayin so long  
Long, long  
And I'm just watchin' the Gong show  
Waitin' for Zorro  
Loosin' the long day since I been home  
  
I got a head of full of feelin' higher  
And an ear full of Patsy Cline  
There is just no one who can touch her  
Hell I'll hang on every line  
Oh crazy how things happen  
It's incredible but true  
Oh the longer I'm gone the closer I feel to you  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
I'm feelin' so glad just to be headin' home  
Home, home  
And I been battling hotel maids  
Chewin' on Rolaids  
Countin' the hours 'til I get home  
Oh I been counting the hours 'til I get home

One day you'll be glad I came around  
I may be the best thing you have found  
Ain't much you can count on in this town  
I swear I'm speaking from my heart  
And I won't let you down.  
  
(Chorus)  
My love is guaranteed  
You're never going to see the end of me  
I've got all you need  
Like a ginsu knife or a bamboo steamer  
Late night TV hawk-eyed screamer  
You'll be the coffee I'll be the creamer  
I'm money back, money back guaranteed  
Money back, money back guaranteed  
  
I just do my best to stay alive  
Got a junked out car but you should see me drive  
Racing down St Charles Avenue  
Ain't got much but what I got  
Will sure be good for you  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Flyin' down the highway of my dreams  
You will find my crazy love  
Is always what it seems  
  
(Chorus)

"This is another new song we'd like to do for you now. It's a, tells the  
Story of a lovely cruise ship couple. You know in November, the snowbirds  
Start heading south down there, and you've seen them with the matching belt  
And shoes, condo commandos, you know. So uh, hey that's good shit. I smell  
It, alright, ooh. We better start this song before I get hungry. This is  
Called 'Morris' Nightmare'."  
  
Down in the islands where the happy folks stay  
Everybody do what Bwana Jim say  
He say its ok, it's ok  
  
You can do what you wanna  
Do what you like  
Twist a big ol' number  
Ride a motorbike  
It's alright, It's alright  
  
Dance to the drum  
Drink a lot of rum  
Love till you come to a stop  
  
Swing like a monkey in a coconut tree  
Sing like the dolphins in the deep blue sea  
Sing it's alright, it's alright  
  
"How does Fred Neil do it? Come on Jay Spell"  
  
You know people in the city got nowhere to go  
They used to go to bars now they go to Discos  
No, no, no disco (uh-uh, no)  
  
They never see the sun  
They hardly see the moon  
They barely see the ground 'til the snow melts in June  
Uptight, It's out of sight  
  
So they save a little money  
Take a little trip  
They only see the islands from a tacky cruise ship  
  
Buy a little liquor  
Buy some sea shells  
Husband tries to sleep  
Wife just yells  
Morris, you can sleep when you get home  
  
Down in the islands where the happy folks stay  
Everybody do what Biwana man say  
He say its ok, it's ok  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do what you wanna, do what you like  
  
"Morris! Oh for Christ's sake Morris, you can sleep when you get home.  
This is supposed to be a vacation you know.  
We come all the way down to Miami.  
We could go someplace nice like SeaWorld.  
I would like to go see, Tony Orlando is playing in Miami Beach.  
We could do some nice things like that.  
But no, What do we do, we have to go down to this goddamn swamp.  
This is a swamp Morris.  
You call this an island? This is a resort?  
It's full of mosquitoes and bugs and just is terrible Morris. Are you
listening to me?"  
  
"Bitch, Bitch, Bitch!"

Well I saw this couple  
Just the other day  
Livin' under a bridge  
In a homeless way  
  
Like a million others  
All over this land  
Livin' day to day  
Without a master plan  
  
In this unforgiving world  
There ain't no doubt  
It will chew you up  
And it will spit you out  
She calls him barracuda  
My barracuda  
  
She used to work in the circus  
A real high wire act  
He was a lion tamer  
Up until the attack  
  
He came without instructions  
Then he came unglued  
Now he's just a monster  
in a human suit  
She calls him barracuda  
My barracuda  
  
She still can't figure out  
What she's doin' down here  
Ans she don't know  
If he loves her or not  
  
He may be a barracuda  
But he's the only lover she's got  
Barracuda

[Chorus:]  
My head hurts, my feet stink, and I don't love Jesus.  
It's that kind of mornin',  
Really was that kind of night.  
Tryin' to tell myself that my  
Condition is improvin' and if I don't  
Die by Thursday I'll be roarin' Friday night.  
  
Went down to the snake pit,  
To drink a little beer.  
Listened to the juke box,  
Oh, it's comin' in clear.  
All of a sudden I wasn't alone  
Pickin' country music with old Joe Bones.  
Duval Street was rockin',  
My eyes they started poppin'!  
Because there she sat at the corner of the bar,  
As I broke another string on my old guitar.  
Someone call a cab.  
Lady won't you pay my tab?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Got to get a little orange juice,  
And a Darvon for my head.  
I can't spend all day,  
Baby, layin' in bed.  
I'm goin' down to Fausto's  
To get some chocolate milk.  
Can't spend my life in your sheets of silk  
I've got to find my way  
Crawl out and greet the day.  
  
[Chorus:]

Nautical wheelers who call themselves sailors  
Play fiddle tunes under the stars.  
Petticoats rustle, working shoes scuffle,  
Hustle on down to the bars.  
  
Where the jukebox is blastin'  
And the liquor is flowing  
An occasional bottle of wine.  
That's cause everyone here is just more than  
Contented to be living and dying in three quarter time.  
  
[Chorus]  
And It's dance with me, dance with me  
Nautical wheelers.  
Take me to stars that you know.  
Come on and dance with me,  
Nautical wheelers  
I want so badly to go.  
  
Well the left foot it'll follow where the  
Right foot has traveled down to the  
Sidewalks unglued.  
And into the street of my city so neat,  
Where nobody cares what you do.  
And Sonja's just grinnin'  
And Phil is ecstatic and  
Mason has jumped in the sea.  
While I'm hangin' on to a line  
From my sailboat oh,  
Nautical Wheelers save me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the sunrise'll bring on the  
Sleep that's escaped us and  
Everyone's off to their bed.  
There'll be huggin' and sqeezin',  
A little pleasin' and teasin'  
And rubbin' of each others' head.  
So won't you dream on comrades  
Seems nothing affects you,  
Nothing, no reason nor rhyme.  
That's cause everyone here is just more than  
Contented to be living and dying in three quarter time.
