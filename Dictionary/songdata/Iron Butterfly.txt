Butterfly Bleu  
  
I found me a little butterfly  
As blue as the sky  
With just a touch of gold  
I knew I had to hold  
My butterfly fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e  
Every time I reached for her  
She managed to slip away  
Takin? my breath away from me  
How can I make her stay  
My butterfly, fly away with me-e-e yeah  
My heart was beating faster  
She started to come near  
Spread her wings around me  
And cast out all my fears  
My butterfly, fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e yeah  
(Instrumental bridge and jam)  
Now the bright light of her eyes show  
She never was leavin? me  
Got in me by my efforts to reach her  
Leading me to be free-e-e-e  
My butterfly fly away with me  
(Yeah, yeah, ooooow)  
Butterfly fly away  
  
  

Fields of sun-blossomed flowers  
Ever so gently movin' about  
Fields of life-givin' sun  
Plant the Earth  
And bring the new young in sprout  
This is the never-ending story  
Of life which goes on  
Day in and day out  
Mountains of evergreen trees  
Standing tall and straight  
Like soldiers about  
Fields of sun-blossomed flowers  
Ever so gently movin' about  
Fields of life-givin' sun  
Plant the Earth  
And bring the new young in sprout  
This is the never-ending story  
Of life which goes on  
Day in and day out  
Mountains of evergreen trees  
Standing tall and straight  
Like soldiers about  

Girl, I just know I love ya now.

Iron Butterfly  
  
In a gadda da vida, baby  
(In the Garden of Eden)  
In a gadda da vida, honey  
Don't you know that I'm lovin' you  
  
Oh, won't you come with me  
And take my hand

And walk this land  
Please take my hand

I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone, somewhere,  
I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone, somewhere.  
Words lost in the past  
Of memories that will never last.  
  
My mind wanders the crowds in a search,  
In the search of the one that I feel is my life,  
It the crowds.  
  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.  
For me this is the end.

Ah, nothing on earth could be so fine  
I think I might have found something  
And I think it might be my love  
  
Yes, I think I came across something  
And I think she might be my love  
  
Oh---oh---oh---  
Yes, it must be love  
I've found out its worth, it must be love  
'Cause nothing on earth could be so fine  
I'm making you mine

Have you heard about the word  
That's going round  
Have you heard about the girl  
Who put me down  
Well, she became aware of the fact  
That I was running round  
And consequently  
my behavior put me down

There's a soldier here today  
But she don't bear steel in anywhere  
She's like a bow  
Seeking a wooden arrow  
Pointing the way to love  
We all know how we can hate  
Just as strong as we could ever love  
We can love, we can love  
God bless you, God  
For Sending me a woman  
Pointing the way to love  
We gotta love a woman  
There's a statue in the square  
But the things they hadn't  
It ain't fair, it ain't fair, Lord  
The things they hadn't  
Cause beneath the stone  
The greatest Man is all alone  
Without a woman to love  
Without a woman to shove  
Without a woman to point the way to love  
We gotta love a woman

Fly blue sky, voices keep calling,  
Bidding me welcome. why maiden land,  
Luring me closer, forbiden land.  
And as I'm standing closer,  
Those natives step beyond.  
Release the mortal patterns,  
My mind I post beyond.  
Spinning in circles,  
Miracles happen,  
As lower life life shows me in to my doom,  
Spirit will striken,  
The end will come soon.  
This is termination,  
The outcome of your life.  

Listen to the clock beat as it ticks out time away,  
And listen to the birds' laughter as they live for today,  
And listen to the heart beat as it beats our lives away.  
  
These are the things that we hear in our world,  
And these are the things that we hear in the time of our lives,  
In the time of our lives.  
  
And to us they are real,  
And for us they're ideal.  
  
How you doing people that passed on yesterday?  
Did you meet with justice on your judgement day?  
  
These are the things that we hear in our world,  
And these are the things that we hear in the time of our lives,  
In the time of our lives.  
  
And to us they are real,  
And for us they're ideal.  
  
Yes, to us,  
Without a doubt they're real.  
  
Without a doubt they're real.  
  
Without a doubt they're real!

We all want to prepare you  
The unbelievable is going to happen  
It will linger in your mind forever  
Let this carry you wherever, wherever  
Triggering the unconscious power  
Removing all your inhibitions  
Releasing complete freedom of thought  
Sensations of every sense will prepare  
With this you will see every thing  
Triggering the unconscious power  
Triggering the unconscious power  
I say to you nothin' for now  
For now we know all  
We know all  
We know all  
We know all  

What the man says is always right  
He'll cuff your hands so you can't fight  
There is no way of getting around it  
He'll lock you up and in your head he'll pound it  
  
Destruction is the only road you're headed for  
There isn't any road behind those steel doors  
You just can't win  
  
Destruction is the only road you're headed for  
There isn't any roads behind those steel doors

You can't win, you can't win  
You can't win, you can't win  
You can't win
