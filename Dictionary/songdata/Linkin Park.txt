Nah, you don't know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me  
You cannot stop, much less control me  
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores  
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors  
Say it's all you can take, better take some more  
  
(Oh)  
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate  
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight  
Stood up strong in spite of that hate  
  
(Oh)  
Night gets darkest right before dawn  
What don't kill you makes you more strong  
And I been waiting for it so long  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
When I was young, they told me, they said  
Make your bed, you lie in that bed  
A king can only reign 'til instead  
There comes that day it's "off with his head"  
  
(Oh)  
The night gets darkest right before dawn  
What don't kill you makes you more strong  
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
And I told them, nah, you don't know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me  
You cannot stop, much less control me  
When it rains, it pours  
When the floodgates open, brace your shores  
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors  
Say it's all you can take, better take some more  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes

Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun,  
We laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind,  
Like any other time,  
But little did we know...  
  
Today, I look for a sign, with flames in my hands,  
A line in the sand, between yours and mine,  
And it came, like fire from below,  
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall,  
But little did you know  
  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
I ain't never been a coward, I aint never seen blood,  
You had sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood,  
We were counting on a leader,  
We were driven by need, couldn't take temptation,  
And we were blinded by greed,  
You were steady as a sniper,  
We were waiting on a wire,  
So we never saw it coming,  
When you ran from the fire,  
You can try intimidation,  
Or you can try to roar,  
But when the time comes calling,  
Yeah! You are gonna get yours!  
  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
And so today, your truth has come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
You're out of time,  
And you will give me back what's mine  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine, give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine! What's mine!  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind, like any other time,  
But little did we know...

I watch how the  
Moon sits in the sky in the dark night  
Shining with the light from the sun  
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming  
The moon's going to owe it one  
It makes me think of how you act to me  
You do  
Favors and then rapidly  
You just  
Turn around and start asking me about  
Things you want back from me  
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
(You'll see it's not meant to be)  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and  
Step on people like you do and  
Run away the people I thought I knew  
I remember back then who you were  
You used to be calm used to be strong  
Used to be generous but you should've known  
That you'd  
Wear out your welcome now you see  
How quiet it is all alone  
I'm so  
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I'm so  
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
(You'll see it's not meant to be)  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
(You'll see it's not meant to be)  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
Shut up  
  
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
  
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place, to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest

In this desert  
In darkness  
Lying with the gun across his chest  
Pretending  
He's heartless  
As the fire flashes in the sky  
He was fragile  
And frozen  
When the bullet took away his friend  
And now he's somehow  
More broken  
  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
Sweating  
And shaking  
Lying with her hands across her chest  
She wakes with  
Her cravings  
As the fire flashes in her eye  
She was fragile  
And frozen  
When the needle took away her friend  
And now she's somehow  
More broken  
  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
With every battle he's chosing  
With every fight he's losing  
His enemy's not far behind  
With every promise she's broken  
With every lie she's spoken  
Her enemy's not far behind  
  
It's your time  
It's your time  
It's your time  
It's - your - time!  
  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
With every battle he's chosing  
With every fight he's losing  
His enemy's not far behind  
With every promise she's broken  
With every lie she's spoken  
Her enemy's not far behind

Ok what is it tonight  
Please just tell me what the hell is wrong  
Do you wanna eat  
Do you wanna sleep  
Do you wanna shout  
Just settle down, settle down, settle down  
  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Just marry me, marry me, marry me  
  
I'm so sick of you tonight  
You never stay awake when I get home  
Is Something wrong with me  
Somethings wrong with you  
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew  
  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Because you married me, married me, married me  
  
When I was young I played a game  
That love and happiness were the same  
Now I'm older and I don't play  
And I found out the hardest way  
  
I got wasted  
She got mad  
She called me names then she got her dad  
He got crazy and I did too  
Wond'ring what I did to you  
  
Well I'll give you candy,  
Give you diamonds,  
Give you pills,  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
I'll do anything, anything, anything,  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything...

Don't start with the ugly part  
Don't end with the things that will make them want to walk away  
Tune in at the den again, Another price ain't cheap but somebody's gonna have
to pay  
Oh yes, you can only guess, what it is, what it was  
Or remember what I had in mind  
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block, half-cocked nearly half the
time  
  
Give it back, give it back, give it back, sing it  
  
One time for the words divine and  
Two times for the things that you hope you never have to say  
Three seams in a dead man's dream  
And the girls tell the boys that they better fucking run away  
Live it up, won't you give it up,  
Turn it up, put it out, let it ride with the other lie  
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block, half-cocked nearly all the
time  
  
Give it back, give it back, give it back, sing it

Atom bombs  
Something's wrong  
D. E. A sent to Guam  
Acid trips  
Big fat chicks  
Purple Flintstone vitamins  
All the needy, rich are greedy  
I find out  
You don't need me  
Berlin Wall starts to fall  
I trip out to the wall  
  
Hooray Hoorah (x8)  
  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Ku Klux Klan makes a plan  
To destroy the black man  
Air pollution, no soloution  
What is causing this confusion  
Anarchism satanism  
Anti-Christ socialism  
A man's brain is deranged  
So we think he's insane  
  
Hoo-ray Hoo-rah (x8)  
  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah

(Yeah)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(Yeah)  
  
I don't wanna be the one to blame,  
You like fun and games,  
Keep playin' them,  
I'm just sayin',  
Think back then,  
We was like one and the same,  
On the right track,  
But I was on the wrong train,  
It's like that,  
Now you've gotta face the pain,  
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play,  
In your brain, like a maze, you could never escape the rain,  
Every damn day's the same shade of grey,  
  
(Hey)  
  
I used to have a little bit of a plan,  
Used to, have a concept of where I stand,  
But that concept slipped right outta my hand,  
And now, I don't really even know who I am, yo,  
What do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
Back then, I thought you were just like me,  
Somebody who could see all the pain I see,  
But you proved to me, unintentionally,  
That you would self-destruct, eventually,  
Now I'm thinking like a mistake I made doesn't hurt, but,  
It's not gonna work,  
''cause it's really much worse than I thought,  
I wished you were something you were not,  
And now this guilt is really all that I've got, (all)  
  
You turn your back and walk away in shame,  
All you got is a memory of pain,  
Nothing makes sense if you stare at the ground,  
I hear my voice in your head when no-one else is around(else is around)  
So what do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(Yeah!)  
  
(yeah)  
  
(Yo!)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(I'll do what I have to do)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(Whatever happens to you)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(What do I have to say)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(It's not gonna happen to me)  
You're on your own now, believe me.

I'm stuck in this bed you made  
Alone with a sinking feeling  
I saw through the words you said  
To the secrets you've been keeping  
It's written upon your face  
All the lies how they cut so deeply  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and never say  
  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down black out blood in your eye  
  
You say that it's not your fault  
And swear that I am mistaken  
You said it's not what it seems  
No remorse for the trust you're breaking  
You run but then back you fall  
Suffocate in the mess you're making  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and take and take  
Fuck it are you listening?  
  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
Black out blood in your eye  
  
Floating down, as colors fill the light  
We look up from the ground  
In fields of paper white  
And floating up you pass us in the night  
A future gazing out a past to overwrite  
So come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect the things you know  
Come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go  
  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh

I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies  
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea  
And poured it out in an ocean of debris  
  
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
  
We held our breathe when the clouds began to form  
But you were lost in the beating of the storm  
But in the end we were made to be apart  
In separate chambers of the human heart  
  
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
It's in the blackened bones  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
  
I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
The blame is mine alone  
For bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve, ooh woah  
What I don't deserve  
  
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies

She can't hide no matter how hard she tries  
Her secret disguise behind her lies  
And at night she cries away her pride  
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside  
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night  
All her family asking if she's all right  
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell  
But all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself  
  
She can only fool herself for so long (3x)  
She can only fool herself  
  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
When it comes to how to live his life  
He can't be told  
Says he's got it all under control  
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with  
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit  
An addict and he can't hold the reigns  
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same  
Tries to slow down the problem he's got  
But can't get off the carousel  
Until he makes it stop  
  
He can only fool himself for so long (3x)  
He can only fool himself  
  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you  
  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

Take me down to the river bend  
Take me down to the fighting end  
Wash the poison from off my skin  
Show me how to be whole again  
  
Fly me up on a silver wing  
Past the black where the sirens sing  
Warm me up in a nova's glow  
And drop me down to the dream below  
  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
  
Bring me home in blinding dream  
Through the secrets that I have seen  
Wash the sorrow from off my skin  
And show me how to be whole again  
  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything else I need to be  
  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see

Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
Consuming, confusing  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
Controlling  
I can't seem  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced  
That there's just too much pressure to take)  
I've felt this way before  
So insecure  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me  
Distracting, reacting  
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection  
It's haunting how I can't seem  
  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced  
That there's just too much pressure to take)  
I've felt this way before  
So insecure  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing, confusing what is real  
  
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
Consuming (confusing what is real)  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
Controlling (confusing what is real)

I have a dream of a scene between the green hills  
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed  
People don't talk about keeping it real  
It's understood that they actually will  
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees  
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze  
Watch them flee, hip-hop hits  
Take a walk with me and what you'll see  
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax  
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue  
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme  
And emcees have left materialism behind them  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might  
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because this is dedicated to the kids  
Dedicated to wherever music lives  
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same  
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game  
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong  
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong  
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run  
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun  
  
I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum  
Out on sunset strip, he asked me "How would you feel  
If everybody acted like you didn't exist  
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip. "  
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this  
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it  
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest  
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith  
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing  
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain  
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might  
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside  
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide  
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside  
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
This is dedicated to the kids  
Dedicated to wherever music lives  
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same  
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game  
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe  
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place  
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run  
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun

Punture me  
Make me feel  
Like I am real  
Torture me  
Drag me under you  
  
Time  
Lifts me up and down  
Time  
Makes me  
Shout  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
Please treat me  
Like I am a fallen angel  
Surpress me  
Tell me  
Lies  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
You can't tell me  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Drag!  
Drag!  
Drag!

It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
Something has been taken from deep inside of me  
A secret I've kept locked away  
No one can ever see  
Wounds so deep they never show  
They never go away  
Like moving pictures in my head  
For years and years they've played  
  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
  
It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
Sometimes I remember  
The darkness of my past  
Bringing back these memories  
I wish I didn't have  
Sometimes I think of letting go  
And never looking back  
And never moving forward so  
There'd never be a past  
  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
  
Just washing it aside  
All of the helplessness inside  
Pretending I don't feel misplaced  
Is so much simpler than change  
  
It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
  
It's easier to run  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made  
It's easier to go  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could stand up and take the blame I would  
I would take all the shame to the grave

Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...  
Then in the middle came Motion Man...  
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]  
  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time  
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle  
  
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder  
I brought you back of the thing  
Like the imaginary man of your dreams  
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it  
  
A sleek skin I never nerved you  
You felt lovin, I never applied a room  
Without bringing the plan  
By any means and means of leaving you teens,  
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt  
  
One thing I don't know how  
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter..  
In the end

Riding with a head full of bodies are red  
And what I said is still stuck in my head  
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back  
But an all front attack, you could never run from that  
Being trapped in this with you,  
Somethin' that I never wanted to do  
But through it all you've got to see that where I want to be  
Is over the pen again letting it out of me  
In the center of the day in the dream, reading all my thoughts  
Getting lost in between, realizing one that the way to the sea  
And the killing and again with a head full of screams  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
And the second it starts we're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart  
Going in the hollow, hoping that you won't know  
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done  
And consequently I've run away, just hidden again  
Within the boundaries of the nameless  
Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down  
Lost in the chaos being tossed around  
  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
Shut... Up... Now!!!  
  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic of my confine

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard  
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact  
That everyone can see these scars  
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel  
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you  
To just believe this is real  
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
Face away and pretend I'm not  
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't feel the way I did before  
Don't turn your back on me  
I won't be ignored  
Time won't heal this damage anymore  
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored  
  
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident  
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can  
But sometimes I don't make sense  
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt  
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me
out  
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
You face away and pretend I'm not  
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You hear me out now  
You're gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now, hear me out now  
You're gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them  
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'  
It's like nothing I can do would distract me when  
I think of how I shot myself in the back again  
'cause from the infinite words I can say I  
Put all pain you gave to me on display  
But didn't realize instead of setting it free I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
  
(Never goes away)  
(Never goes away)  
  
(And now)  
(You've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be right here)  
(You've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be my fear)  
(I can't separate)  
(Myself from what I've done)  
(Giving up a part of me)  
(I've let myself become you)  
  
Hearing your name the memories come back again  
I remember when it started happening  
I see you n' every thought I had and then  
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them  
And I knew as they escaped away  
I was committing myself to em n' everyday  
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see that I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
  
(Never goes away)  
(Never goes away)  
  
(And now)  
(You've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be right here)  
(You've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be my fear)  
(I can't separate)  
(Myself from what I've done)  
(Giving up a part of me)  
(I've let myself become you)  
  
(Never goes away)  
(Never goes away)  
(Never goes away)  
(Never goes away)  
  
(Get away from me)  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
(Go)  
Everything comes down the memories of  
(You)  
I kept it in without letting you  
(Know)  
I let you go so get away from  
(Me)  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
(Go)  
Everything comes down the memories of  
(You)  
I kept it in without letting you  
(Know)  
I let you go  
  
(And then you've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be right here)  
(You've become a part of me)  
(You'll always be my fear)  
(I can't separate)  
(Myself from what I've done)  
(Giving up a part of me)  
(I've let myself become you)  
(I've let myself become you)  
(I've let myself become)  
(lost inside these thoughts of you)  
(giving up a part of me)  
(I've let myself become you)

Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say  
Suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away  
'Cause I don't have a reason  
And you don't have the time  
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever but then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
  
All I've ever wanted, the secrets that you keep  
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak  
'Cause I can't see forgiveness,  
And you can't see the crime  
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over,  
The scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

From the top to the bottom  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
  
There's a place so dark you can't see the end  
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend  
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions, forcefully  
The power of suggestion, then with the eyes shut  
Looking through the rust and rot and dust  
A small spot of light floods the floor  
And pours over the rusted world of pretend  
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again  
  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
  
[Chorus]  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
  
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs  
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound the wheels go round  
And the sunset creeps behind street lamps  
Chain link and concrete  
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn  
Floats on down the street till the wind is gone  
And the memory now is like the picture was then  
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again  
  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
  
In the memory, you will find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up

I don't know who to trust your surprise  
(Everyone feels so far away from me)  
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies  
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)  
  
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet  
(All I ever think about is this)  
(All the tiring time between)  
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)  
  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
  
Tension is building inside steadily  
(Everyone feels so far away from me)  
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me  
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)  
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet)  
(All I ever think about is this)  
(All the tiring time between)  
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)  
  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
  
I won't waste myself on you  
You  
You  
Waste myself on you  
You  
You  
  
I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
  
Everything from the inside and just throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
You  
You

[Spoken]  
Of course you know what a fuse is...  
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder  
When you strike a match and light it  
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end  
At which there is, a little surprise  
  
Krypton, short suit mcs you'll be ripped on  
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you just slipped on  
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong  
Rock on, sing songs mightier than King Kong  
A Donkey, you think you want me or want this  
Want some, hold your reputation for Ransom  
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics  
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic  
Galactic, space now yeah that grabs attention  
Crack heads nodded like a pest can't even mention  
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections  
Kid steps this he need witness protection  
  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
  
It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific  
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum  
Hear one, lalala loose frind me fearsome  
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone  
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth battalion  
Shallow the one who's run like rebels  
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level  
In intensity, send back the tax that you sent to me  
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me  
Mp3 versus R33 mcs, Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze  
We're mcs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout you
want these  
Please, don't even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it
down like pens  
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the
back of an mcs hand  
With the strength that he had a bridge you don't want that close body fields
in hand to hand combat  
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords  
Come deford shots get rid don't question my intention when your butt gets
kicked  
  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks  
  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks

Wake in a sweat again  
Another day's been laid to waste  
In my disgrace  
Stuck in my head again  
Feels like I'll never leave this place  
There's no escape  
I'm my own worst enemy  
  
[Chorus]  
I've given up  
I'm sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say?  
Take this all away  
I'm suffocating!  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!  
  
I don't know what to take  
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared  
I'm not prepared  
I hyperventilate  
Looking for help somehow, somewhere  
And no one cares  
I'm my own worst enemy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
God!  
  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my...  
Put me out of my fucking misery!  
  
[Chorus]

Will you, walk me to the edge again?  
Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again  
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me  
I'm giving in to you  
  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
  
Caught up, in life  
Losing all my friends  
Family has tried, to heal all my addictions  
Tragic it seems, to be alone again  
I'm giving in... To you  
  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
  
I look forward, to dying tonight  
Drink till I'm myself, life's harder every day  
The stress has got me  
I'm giving in  
Giving in  
Giving in now!  
  
Take me under  
(I'm killing all the pain)  
I'm dying tonight  
(I'm sick of all this faith)  
Watch me crumble  
(I'm killing all the pain)  
I'm crying tonight  
  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you

[Verse:]  
Tell us all again what you think we should be,  
What the answers are, what it is we can't see.  
Tell us all again how to do what you say,  
How to fall in line, how there's no other way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
But oh, we all know  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Show us all again that our hands are unclean,  
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need.  
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved,  
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And oh, you will know  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same (all the same, all the
same).  
Guilty all the same (all the same, all the same)  
You're guilty all the same!  
  
[Rakim]  
Yeah, you already know what it is.  
Can y'all explain, what kind of man is destined?  
When a man has plans of being rich,  
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?  
Dirty money scheme, a clean split,  
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy.  
Talk team, they take the paper route,  
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.  
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience.  
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me.  
Smoke scream, we're going in flames,  
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be,  
Say it's time for things to change.  
We arrange that dope product we built cheap,  
Anything if it's more to gain.  
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep,  
Until no more remains, but I'm still me  
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio  
You record companies kill me  
Try to force me to strain it, no way  
They got the gall to say "yo, how real can real be?"  
You feel me? You will see, the greed will be to blame  
Greedy for the fame, tv or a name  
Media, the game, to me your all the same  
You're guilty.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same (all the same, all the
same).  
Guilty all the same (all the same, all the same),  
Guilty all the same.

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....  
  
Hybrid  
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space  
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits  
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with
telekanetic psychology  
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it  
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist  
Many men have tried to shake us  
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of  
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you
MC's who hate us  
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on  
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones  
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this  
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise  
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice  
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
  
Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones  
Never satisfied my rhymes jones  
Spraying bright day over what you might say  
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A  
On highways write with road rage  
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around  
Surround sound  
Devouring the scenes  
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things  
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit  
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics  
Forth dimension, compact convention  
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention  
Ment to put you away, with the pencil  
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile  
While you risk your all  
I pick out at your flaws  
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
  
Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land  
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova  
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious  
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage  
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest  
Then I might blast the masses  
Subliminals transmitted through piano  
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano  
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through
time  
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles  
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules  
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram  
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen  
A telepath of the another verse with no postage  
Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin' you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
Linkin Park [being scratched over, and over again]

I scream through the morning  
I'm kicking in the twilight as she comes  
Time waits at a darling  
Spooning the thickness out and feeding our open mouths  
  
The price you pay is always  
  
Chorus  
Too high, I'm too familiar  
Sunshine, Karma Killer  
  
Time waits at the darling  
When your following the animals around (around)  
I spread through the morning  
Feeding our open mouths and spooning the thickness out  
The price you pay is always  
Chorus (x2)  
  
My eyes are weary now  
My eyes are weary  
My eyes are weary now  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Karma Killer  
Will I ever miss you?

No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
Its our Final war  
Tell me what's worth fighting for  
When we know there's nothing more  
Take the hand or fist  
Just to sell ourselves for this  
The path we least resist  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
[Verse 2 - Mike]  
Uh, I give you what you came for  
This is not the same though  
Got a different method  
But I still can bring the pace so  
Not all give the same though  
I got down the same flow  
I ain't shock and get you  
Never really in my range, though  
Somehow they ain't grow. High five, bango  
All pride childs. Mama let the bass bang though  
All you fucking lames go  
Yelling out the names though  
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for  
(Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for)  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
I'm my own casualty

I dreamed I was missing  
You were so scared  
But no one would listen  
Cause no one else cared  
After my dreaming  
I woke with this fear  
What am I leaving  
When I'm done here?  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
When my time comes  
Forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed  
And don't resent me  
And when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory  
Leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest  
  
Don't be afraid  
I've taken my beating  
I've shed but I'm me  
I'm strong on the surface  
Not all the way through  
I've never been perfect  
But neither have you  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
I can't be who you are

And the tears fall like rain  
Down on my face again  
Oh the words you wouldn't say  
And the games you played  
With my unfoolish heart  
Oh I should have known this from the start  
  
Oh the winter and spring  
Going hand in hand  
Just like my love and pain  
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vain  
Oh this brand new skin stretched across scared terrain  
  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
  
Oh...  
  
All those years down the drain  
Love was not enough when you want everything  
What I gave to you and now the end must start  
Oh I should have listened to my heart  
  
'Cause I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
  
Oh...  
  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road

I'ma be that nail in your coffin  
Sayin' that I soften  
I was duckin' down to reload  
So you can save your petty explanations  
I don't have the patience  
  
Before you even say it I know  
You let your pride and your ego  
Talk slick to me no  
That is not the way I get down  
And look at how you lose your composure  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
What is it you want me to tell ya?  
I'm not the failure  
I would rather live and let be  
But you can't make the right kinda threat to  
Push me to let you  
No, you can't intimidate me  
You disrespect me so clearly  
Now you better hear me  
That is not the way it goes down  
You did it to yourself and it's over  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery

(Yeah) (Yo)  
You were that foundation  
Never gonna be another one, no  
I followed, so taken  
So conditioned I could never let go  
Then sorrow, then sickness  
Then the shock when you flip it on me  
So hollow, so vicious  
So afraid I couldn't let myself see  
That I could never be held  
Back up, no, I'll hold myself  
Check the rep, yep you know my rail  
Forget the rest let them know my hell  
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell,  
Kept respect up the vets stay their,  
Let the rest be to tell they tale  
That I was there saying  
  
[Chorus]  
And these promises broken  
Deep, feeble  
Each word gets lost in the echo  
So one last lie I can see through  
This time I finally let you  
Go, go, go  
  
Test my will, test my heart  
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up  
Y'all go hard, I go smart  
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?  
I've seen that frustration  
Big cross, they're lost but don't know  
And I've come back unshaken  
Let down, I've lived and let go  
So you can let it be known  
I don't hold back, I hold my own  
I can't be mad, I can't be calm  
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone  
I can't fall back, I came too far  
Hold myself up and love my scars  
Let the bells ring wherever they are  
'Cause I was there saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, you can tell 'em all now  
I don't back up, I don't back down  
I don't fold up, and I don't bow  
I don't roll over, don't know how  
I don't care where the enemies are  
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!  
Won't forget how I got this far  
And every time, saying  
  
[Chorus]

When I pretend  
Everything is what I want it to be  
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see  
When I pretend  
I can forget about the criminal I am  
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can, but  
I can't pretend this is the way it will stay, I'm just  
Trying to bend the truth  
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be  
So I'm  
Lying my way from you  
  
(no, no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
I remember what they taught to me  
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be  
Remember listening to all of that and this again  
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in  
And now you think this person really is me and I'm  
(trying to bend the truth)  
But the more I push  
The more I'm pulling away  
'cause I'm  
  
Lying my way from you  
  
(no, no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
You  
(no turning back now)  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
(no, no turning back now)  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
(no turning back now)  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
(no, no turning back now)  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me

There's a fragile game you play  
If the ghosts of yesterday  
If we can't let go whenever, say goodbye  
No trace of what remains  
No stones to mark the graves  
Only memories we thought we could deny  
  
There's so much more to lose  
Than the pain I put you through  
And my carelessness that left you in the dark  
And the blood may wash away  
But the skies will never fade  
At least I know somehow I made a mark  
  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right

I've lived through things I cannot say  
Back then we dreamt of yesterday  
It seemed as if the only way  
And now we look for hope and pray  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing in the end  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing, losing  
  
It came up from the deepest sea  
God gave it life and reason to be  
His Shadow rose above the highest tree  
And still his face we could not see  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Chorus:]  
  
Repeat first verse

This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
This is my December  
This is my snow covered home  
This is my December  
This is me alone  
  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said to you  
  
And I'd give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
These are my snow covered trees  
This is me pretending  
This is all I need  
  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things I said to you  
  
And I give it all away  
Just to have  
Somewhere to go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to

So this is the last treat of the night coming up right here  
This is a song, this is a tour actually, this is the first time we've played
this song on tour  
I'll spit it out eventually  
Anybody like the Deftones?  
Got any Deftones' fans in the house?  
Put em' up if you are  
Let me see you if you know the words to this shit and i'll come down and sing
it with you  
Hey you, big star, guide me when it's over  
Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter  
'Cause I'm through, when the two hits the six and it's summer  
Cloud, come  
Shove  
The sun  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer  
You guys feeling that?  
Who can help me with this shit, can you?  
Can you help me with this shit?  
Stay right here, stay right here  
Hey you..  
Stay right here  
Come on  
Yo, yo  
What the fuck is going on?  
Yea, bring him over here  
Allright bro, we gonna teach these mother fuckers this shit, ok?  
You guys gonna help us out right now?  
Allright you guys  
Chester, when you're ready bud  
The shade is a tool, a device, a savior  
See, I try  
(You better watch out)  
And look up  
(Where?)  
To the sky  
(Why?)  
But my eyes burn  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it  
The sun  
Aside  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
The sun  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer

You might as well quit while your at it  
You aint going no where  
I feel so hollow inside  
And it' s all your fault  
You' re the cause of all this pain  
Now I' m left here dying  
  
You think you can beat me  
It' s never gonna happen  
You wanna reach the end  
It' s never gonna happen  
Do what you wanna do  
It aint gonna happen  
  
I wont let you do this  
Not anymore  
Ur so vindictive  
You always have been  
I regret the day I met you, I saw you  
Now you don' t even remember me  
I' m just the voice in your head  
Screaming, crying  
And telling you......  
  
That it aint gonna happen ....

I remembered black skies  
The lightning all around me  
I remembered each flash  
As time began to blur  
Like a startling sign  
That fate had finally found me  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross  
The distance in your eyes  
  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
  
There was nothing in sight  
But memories left abandoned  
There was nowhere to hide  
The ashes fell like snow  
And the ground caved in  
Between where we were standing  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
Across this new divide  
  
In every loss  
In every lie  
In every truth that you'd deny  
And each regret  
And each goodbye  
Was a mistake to great to hide  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
  
Across this new divide  
Across this new divide

Are you lost  
In your lies?  
Do you tell yourself "I don't realize"?  
  
Your crusade's a disguise  
Replace freedom with fear  
You trade money for lives  
  
I'm aware of what you've done  
  
[Chorus]  
No, no more sorrow  
I've paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced  
  
I see pain  
I see need  
I see liars and thieves  
Abused power with greed  
I had hope  
I believed  
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived  
  
You will pay for what you've done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more sorrow  
I've paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced!  
Your time has come to be replaced!  
Your time has come to be erased!

Standing alone with no direction  
How did I fall so far behind'  
Why am I searching for perfection  
Knowing it's something I won't find'  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
'Til the silence splits me open, I run  
'Til it puts me underground  
'Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
  
When did I lose my sense of purpose'  
Can I regain what's lost inside'  
Why do I feel like I deserve this'  
Why does my pain look like my pride'  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I let myself down  
  
In my fear and flaws, I run  
'Til the silence splits me open, I run  
'Til it puts me underground  
'Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
No roads left but one  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
And the silence splits me open, I run  
And it puts me underground  
But there's no regret  
And no roads left to run

Come, come, come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Peep the style and the kids checking for it  
The number one question is  
How could you ignore it  
We drop right back in the cut  
Over basement tracks  
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that)  
We're just rolling with the rhythm  
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division  
With these non-stop lyrics of life living  
Not to be forgotten  
But still unforgiven  
But in the meantime there are those who want to  
Talk this and that, so I suppose  
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt  
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt  
  
[Chorus]  
Try to give you warning  
But everyone ignores me  
(Told you everything loud and clear)  
But nobody's listening  
Call to you so clearly  
But you don't want to hear me  
(Told you everything loud and clear)  
But nobody's listening  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
And everything's left is a waste of time  
I hate my rhymes  
(But hate everyone else's more)  
I'm riding on the back of this pressure  
Guessing that it's better  
I can't keep myself together  
Because all of this stress  
Gave me something to write on  
The pain gave me something  
I could set my sights on  
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears  
The uphill struggle over the years  
The fear and trash talking  
And the people it was to  
And the people that started it  
Just like you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears  
Nothing to gain, everything to fear  
  
(Scratches)  
Coming at you at every style

I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface  
I don't know what you're expecting of me  
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes  
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  
  
[Chorus]  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
Become so tired, so much more aware  
By becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
  
Can't you see that you're smothering me?  
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control  
'Cause everything that you thought I would be  
Has fallen apart right in front of you  
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  
And every second I waste is more than I can take!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I know I may end up failing too  
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

We stood upon the edge  
Eyes fixed in the sky  
Just before twilight  
Claimed the lights  
Wind carried voices  
Over the waters  
From a whisper  
Into a scream  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
  
The words that we cast  
Into eternity  
They still echo in my ears  
And in my dreams  
So meet me tonight  
In the place that time forgot  
And take with you  
All that you can't leave behind  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
  
Headlights open  
The road ahead  
They can't light up the sky  
But they can light our way  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here

(Footsteps)  
  
Hurry up and wait  
So close, but so far away  
Everything that you've always dreamed of  
Close enough for you to taste  
But you just can't touch  
  
[Bridge]  
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated  
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
  
[Chorus]  
One step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
[Verse 2]  
You believe and you doubt  
You're confused, you got it all figured out  
Everything that you always wished for  
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours  
If they only knew  
  
[Bridge]  
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated  
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
  
[Chorus]  
One step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
[Verse 3]  
When you can't wait any longer  
But there's no end in sight  
When you need to find the strength  
It's the faith that makes you stronger  
The only way we get there  
Is one step at a time  
  
[Chorus]  
Take one step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
[Chorus]  
One step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time

I want to be in another place,  
I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
  
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night,  
Shining with the light from the sun,  
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,  
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,  
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,  
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,  
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,  
Find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest.  
  
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to  
  
Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya  
Gimme energon to keep me calm  
You and your mom keep on the drom  
Used to be a team, passed that baton  
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb  
Take it to the john in your babylon  
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on.  
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn  
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on.  
  
So sick of you stressin'  
Sick of you fessin'  
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.  
  
Sick of you stressin'  
Sick of you fessin'  
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.  
  
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
You try to get the best of me, go away, go away, go away,  
you try to take the best of me, go away (repeat to end)

You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine  
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind  
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through  
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
  
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end  
I'm left with emptiness that words can not defend  
You'll never know what I became because of you  
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
  
Powerless  
Powerless

Why's does it feel like night today?  
Something in here's not right today  
Why am I so uptight today?  
Paranoia's all I got left  
I don't know what stressed me first  
Or how the pressure was fed  
But I know just what it feels like  
To have a voice in the back of my head  
It's like a face that I hold inside  
A face that awakes when I close my eyes  
A face that watches everytime I lie  
A face that laughs everytime I fall  
(And watches everything)  
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim  
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
Hey yo  
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind  
But I find myself in places with names but no faces  
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees  
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
The face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!  
  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun goes down  
  
It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun  
  
Can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

Yo, yo  
Forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame  
Put your name to shame, cover up your face  
You can't run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won't last  
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last,  
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't
last,  
Won't last, won't last  
  
You love the way, I look at you  
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through  
You take away if I give in  
My life, my pride, is broken  
  
You like to think you're never wrong  
(You like to think you're never wrong)  
You have to act like you're someone  
(You have to act like you're someone)  
You want someone to hurt like you  
(You want someone to hurt like you)  
You want to share what you've been through  
(You live what you've learned)  
Learned, learned, learned, learned, learned  
  
You love the things, I say I'll do  
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you  
You take away, when I give in  
My life, my pride, is broken  
  
You like to think you're never wrong  
(You like to think you're never wrong)  
You have to act like you're someone  
(You have to act like you're someone)  
You want someone to hurt like you  
(You want someone to hurt like you)  
You wanna' share what you've been through  
(You live what you've learned)  
  
Yo, yo  
Forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame  
Put your name to shame, cover up your face  
You can't run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won't last  
Forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame

Oh, oh

[Verse 1]  
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken,  
The lost and the sights unseen.  
I want a flood, I want an ocean,  
To wash my confusion clean.  
I can't resolve this empty story,  
I can't repair the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We act it out, we wear the colors,  
Confined by the things we own.  
We're not without, we're like each other,  
Pretending we're here alone.  
And far away, they burn their buildings  
Right in the face of the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Bridge]  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
We lost before the start!  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
One by one we fall apart!  
We fall apart! We fall apart! We fall apart!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of, Imitations of...  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion.

Next message  
Hey, Mike, what's up?  
This is Roc, just asking you what's happening?  
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went  
Um, just seeing if you're going to see Joe sometime soon, too,  
Because he's got my keyboard that I've been trying to get back  
I've been trying to call him and he hasn't been returning any messages  
So I'm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back  
Heyy dude this is a good idea to get a message around...i like that  
  

Graffiti decorations  
Under the sky of dust  
A constant wave of tension  
On top of broken trust  
The lessons that you taught me  
I learned were never true  
  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
Paper bags and angry voices  
Under a sky of dust  
Another wave of tension  
Has more than filled me up  
All my talk of taking action  
These words were never true  
  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind

Rollin' twenties up like Snoop Doggy dog's crip game  
But I'm out for the crown, housin, I'm buckin' 'em down  
Dousin' and dunkin' these fuckin punks in a bucket and bounce  
When I get up in the game beware  
Put a pimp on a hope and then say your prayers  
Got this ocean so damn potent player  
Put you on a throne like a broken chair  
You know it's a move no crack for the gods and goons  
We back you talk about gats but don't actually use 'em  
But I'm happy to do it because this is demigodz  
Celph Titled, Ryu with Tak, Apathy stupid  
  
From bottom to top choppin them rocks  
Cockin the glock, o more of that  
Now I just hop in the drop and go  
To the most popular spots  
With ho's and they know, they go  
I went from pumpin' that white stuff  
To bein up in them white clubs  
Like hey, I got dubs still pumpin that white stuff  
Plus I fuck with the white boys, skaters and bike boys  
Who may act different but the struggles alike, boy  
Shinoda know that if there's a problem I'm coming over, yo  
Quick fast in a hurry, not needing to overdose  
And I mean that, just call if you need that  
The best of both different worlds, not often they see that  
  
Like oh, ohhh, ohhhh  
F.M. D.E.M.I.G.O.D.Z.  
Like oh, ohhh, ohhhh

We like these rappers here that you have to fear  
We smacking queers murder extortion  
Hustlin', nothin' stopin' this movement  
I swear we gettin' to the top this year  
Got your ears, all eyes on me, old school 80's guy, that's me  
Hip hop head female rappers give me dome  
That's just that hip hop head, flip off the feds, it's been said  
I'm out my mind to the fullest, alone in the crib buggin  
Fuckin with russian roulette with six bullets  
Won't never free my guns but fo sho we lettin them triggers go  
Sparkin that weapon, yous a thousand miles from me  
You far from perfection and that's just room for thought  
I'm movin the bar, rap entrepenuer, rap lord  
Cme to the hood, I'll bring you in through that trap door  
It's Demigodz and it's Dipset, it's Doe Rakers and it's Byrd Gang

This has been a Demigodz Dipset Feature Presentation  
  
We'll slap the beeswax right out your grill! Hold up!

I close both locks below the window  
I close both blinds and turn away  
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple  
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
And the sun will set for you  
The sun will set for you  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you  
  
In cards and flowers on your window  
Your friends all plead for you to stay  
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple  
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you  
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you

She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody,  
Wants to pick her head  
  
[Chorus:]  
She said she loved me  
And lied to me  
She was by the river  
And lied to me  
  
She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody,  
Wants her in their bed  
  
[Chorus:]  
She said she loved you  
And lied to you  
She was by the river  
And lied to you  
  
So eager  
So eager  
So eager  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So eager7x  
  
So eager 3x  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So eager 6x

Skin to bone, steel to rust  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
Will tomorrow have it's way  
With the promises we made  
Skin to bone, steel to rust.  
  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
Your deception, my disgust  
When your name is finally drawn,  
I'll be happy that you're gone  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.  
  
[Chorus]  
(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust  
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust  
  
Right to left, left to right  
Night to day and day to night  
As the starlight fades to gray,  
I'll be watching far away  
Right to left and left to right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Will tomorrow have it's way  
With the promises betrayed  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust

There's no way to find out what's inside you  
Until you fall into the hole  
You dug for yourself while you slept here  
Too young, too selfish, too cold  
And when you find out what's been waiting  
The moment you open your eyes  
You'll see your true reflection  
The very first time in your life  
  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run  
  
Into the hole you fall deeper  
Deeper the faster you run  
It won't stop until you've accepted  
Accept everythng that you've done  
  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run

Caught up against the wall again  
Tied and chained to the ball again  
Never seems to amaze my mind  
So I just sleep (sleep) sleep (sleep) sleep (sleep)please don't  
  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
  
Cut and bruised by the fall again  
Lick my wounds like a dog again  
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel  
That I see I see please let it be but don't  
  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
  
Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end  
To the pain I feel when I'm  
Awake and alive alive alive  
Alive and not dreamin'  
  
Caught up against the wall again  
Tied and chained to the ball again  
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel  
That I see I see please let it be but don't  
  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
  
Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end  
To the pain I feel when I'm  
Awake and alive alive alive  
Alive and not dreamin'

We knew the world would not be the same.  
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.  
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita.  
Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty  
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,  
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.  
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

See I was once told  
That I would litterate gold  
Now I'm at the crossroads  
Selling my soul  
I've been laughed at  
Slepped on and stepped on  
Backstabbed twice but I always kept on  
  
I'm falling  
And I can hear my conscience calling  
I see my life dissolving  
While I'm one stallin  
Why life's gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay  
Just to live another day  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
  
She saw life's a bitch but I love her  
Brother never judge a book by the cover  
Same name but different faces  
Same case but different places  
Life's strange  
Joy, pain  
Sunshine, rain  
Yo we've gotta maintain  
Why life gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay just to see another day  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling (falling, falling,
falling)  
  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie (lie, lie, lie)  
You're living on a lie (lie, lie, lie)  
  
It spill blood, sweat and tears  
I crept on my knees  
And begged for deaf ears  
I wouldn't learn  
Until I got burned  
Every laugh was changed  
That was the day it got turned  
Lifes Strange somebody wants me to obtain  
Some people change, others stay the same  
Why life's gotta be this way  
See it's the price we pay just to live another day  
  
Get yourself up you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling (falling, falling,
falling)  
  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up get up, don't stop, you're falling  
Get yourself up you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
  
You're living on a lie

I am not a pattern to be followed  
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal, not a role model  
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame or the same person telling you to forfeit
the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbelly's
sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
'cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first  
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
  
Ya'll oughta stop talking  
Start trying to catch up motherfucker!  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
  
Lauryn said money change the situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one  
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a motherfuckin' ton  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma say it for the record  
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak  
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack  
Closest to a peak, far from a punk  
Ya'll oughta stop talking, start trying to catch up mother fucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
  
When they come for me  
Come for me  
I'll be gone [x3]  
  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker!

[Verse:]  
You've been taking it all this time  
You left my trust on the firing line  
As the promises break, the only mistake -  
Giving you what was mine  
Your words are clear but their meanings gone  
The notes are right but the tunings wrong  
And when you tell me again that I should give in  
I can only take it so long long long long  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Fear is dancing inside your lies  
Exposing secrets that you've disguised  
And I'm biting my tongue as you become  
Victim of a compromise  
Cause I know who you really are  
Not a scratch where you can take a scar  
And it's time that you seek the truth without me  
I can only get you so far far far far  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!  
  
Throw it all away, all away (x5)  
  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!

This is the first day of my last days  
I built it up, now I take it apart  
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far  
No need to me to stay, the last thing left I just threw it away  
I put my faith in god and my trust in you  
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do  
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I'm the one without a soul, I'm the one with this big fucking hole  
Now new tale to tell, twenty-six years on my way to hell  
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck  
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me, I hate everyone  
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I want to, but I can't turn back  
But I want to.

I woke up in a dream today  
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor  
Forgot all about yesterday  
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore  
A little taste of hypocrisy  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're so close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
  
It's true  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
  
I'm with you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
  
I hit you and you hit me back  
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still  
Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real  
Now I'm trapped in this memory  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
  
It's true  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
  
I'm with you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
  
No, no matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
No matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
With you  
  
With you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
With you  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
With you  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
With you  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes
