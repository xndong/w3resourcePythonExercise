Ma la petit ca de bonee  
Life could be sweet, sweet beaujolais  
Beautiful dream on a beautiful day  
Are you what you seem, sweet beaujolais

I had somebody,somebody who loved me.  
Someone so good to me.  
You were my angel, you were my heaven  
But i was too blind to see.  
  
I let you slip away, i guess i never knew.  
I had the world with you .  
I'd be there, still be there in your arms.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
  
I had my chances,i took advantage.  
I took it all too far.  
So now you're gone, and i'm all alone,  
Alone with my lonely heart.  
I let it fall apart,i didn't care enough.  
I lost your precious love.  
You'd be here,still be here in my arms.  
  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You's still be mine.  
  
I'd be loving you, i'd be holding you,  
I'd be loving you.  
If not for my careless heart.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
You'd be loving me.  
You'd still be mine.  
(fade)

My life changes all the time.  
Things were different when you were mine.  
You loved me yesterday.  
Now these changes have come to stay.  
There have been changes,  
So many changes along the way.  
(Too many changes,changes in the way).  
(So many changes,changes in the how).  
(To many changes, changes when you cry).  
  
Time brings changes,right or wrong.  
I still love you, but now you're gone.  
  
Maybe someday love will come,  
But who can say what kind of changes,  
What kind of changes come my way.  
(Too many changes come along).  
(Too many changes,leaving me alone).  
(So many changes,now that you are gone).

Sad eyes, sad eyes, across the room  
Sad eyes, crying in your gloom  
Sad eyes, love has been untrue  
  
Just look at me, oh just look at me  
Just look at me, I'm lonely too  
I'm like you, so like you, sad eyes  
  
Oh sad eyes  
Don't you know that tears can be erased?  
Oh sad eyes Tears won't help  
But maybe I can replace that other face  
  
Sad eyes, sad eyes, this ain't just a line  
Sad eyes, maybe we can find  
Sad eyes, somewhere down the line  
  
Happiness, oh happiness Happiness together, you and I  
Someday, some way, sad eyes

Devil Doll..........Devil Doll  
We went steady in the fall,  
We broke up in the spring  
Your young lovin blinds,  
And you gave me back my ring  
Well I see now what my friends saw then,  
That you're just not the one  
To love someone true  
The way I love you,  
Oh devil doll  
Now I'm not the first one  
And I won't be the last,  
You'll make my heart  
Just another heart you've broken in the past  
Don't play a game with another guy,  
Don't make me feel so blue,  
I'm a guy that's true and I love you  
Oh devil doll  
Now I'm not the first one  
Don't let me be the last,  
Don't make my heart  
Just another heart you've broken in the past,  
Don't play a game with another guy,  
Don't make me feel so blue,  
I'm a guy that's true and I love you  
Oh devil doll (devil doll)  
  

I hear the sound of distant drums  
Far away, far away  
And if they call for me to come  
Then I must go and you must stay  
  
So Mary marry me, let's not wait  
Let's share all the time we can, before it's too late  
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be  
And if you love me Mary, Mary marry me  
  
I hear the sound of bugles blow  
Far away, far away  
And if they call then I must go  
Who knows where or who can say?  
  
So Mary marry me, let's not wait  
For those distant drums, might change our wedding day  
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be  
And if you love me Mary, Mary marry me  
Yes, if you love me Mary, Mary marry me

There's a cat in town that you might know  
He goes by the name of Domino  
A long tweed jacket and a diamond ring  
A blue sport car, he's a crazy king  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
  
Well the girls all think that he's a real gone guy  
They all flip when he walks by  
Shanty clothes and cool white shoes  
He's rearm' to go and never sings the blues  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
  
He's got cool black hair and a solid style  
Long side-bums and a crazy smile  
A thousand girls, they'll tell you so  
They dig that cat called Domino  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
Well Domino, cool man go, Domino, they love him so  
Get out of the way, here comes Domino, Domino, Domino

If you don't really love her  
Don't take her from me  
Because I really love her  
And need her desperately  
  
If you don't plan to give  
All your love, for as long as you should live  
Don't take her from me  
  
If she's not something special  
Don't take her from me  
Because she's something special to me  
Can't you see?  
  
If she's not number one  
Every day, till your whole life is done  
Don't take her from me  
  
There is only one for me  
She is all there could ever be  
So don't take her from me

I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so lonely  
And I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so blue  
Oh I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then some day, you'd leave me for somebody new  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do? yeah  
I'm crazy for thinkin' that my love could hold you  
Crazy for tryin', crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?  
I'm crazy for thinkin' that my love could hold you  
Crazy for tryin', crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you  
Crazy for tryin', and crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you  

Sadness slips in to the room  
On silent steps of sorrow  
Stealing sleep and all my dreams  
Where will we be tomorrow  
Lying with you  
Crying with you  
Drifting  
Talking till dawn  
Yet we go on  
Drifting  
Don't understand where we begin  
Just drifting apart  
Drifting apart  
Feeling alone  
Drifting away  
  
We can't seem to work it out  
Drifting from day to day  
What is it all about  
Drifting away  
Drifting away  
Drifting away  
Losing the feeling  
And now the music of this song is almost done  
And we used to play  
From sweet surrender  
To drifting away  
Drifting  
  
Two lovers lost  
Two rivers crossed  
Drifting,  
Two bridges burned  
No lessons learned  
Drifting  
  
Lonely together  
Hurting each other  
Still we can't say that it is over  
Can't we bring back yesterday  
  
Will we will be forever  
Forever drifting away  
Drifting  
Drifting away

Sometimes love will bloom in the springtime  
Then like flowers in summer it will grow  
And then fade away in the winter  
When the cold winds begin to blow  
  
But when it's evergreen, evergreen  
It will last through the summer and winter too  
When love is evergreen, evergreen  
Like my love for you  
  
So hold my hand and tell me  
You'll be mine through laughter or through tears  
Then let the whole world see, our love will be  
Evergreen through all the years  
  
For when it's evergreen, evergreen  
It will last through the summer and winter too  
When love is evergreen, evergreen  
Like my love for you

Well I was driving in my car  
With fourteen women after me  
Down Fifth Avenue  
A Friday night it just to be  
She was standing on the corner  
Thumbing a ride  
I said,: "Hop in baby  
Scoot closer by my side"  
Honey let's go riding you look so exciting  
Where have you been hiding?  
CHORUS  
Friday night, feeling tight  
Friday night, think she might  
Friday night, Friday night  
There's no telling what you'll find  
Cruising on a Friday night  
She didn't say a word  
She just kept those big blue eyes on me  
I wondered what she could be thinkin'  
As she put her little hand on my knee  
I took another sip of malted brew  
And then I looked in her eyes  
And as I sank into her bbaby blues  
I thought "My oh my"  
There's no use in fighting you look so exciting  
Where have you been hiding girl?  
CHORUS  
Cruising on a Friday night  
Cruising on a Friday night  
Cruising on a Friday night  

I really wouldn't mind it might be fun.  
At any other time with any other one.  
But lovers can't be friends.  
And there's only one way it can end.  
I would lose you,I would lose you.  
  
There are not many girls I can talk with.  
There are not many girls I can walk with.  
And I don't have many friends if any,  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
I'm really wanting you to go away.  
Everything you do, the things you say.  
Confuse me now and then,  
And I think I love you, my friend.  
Go away,go away.  
  
You're the only girl I have fun with.  
You're the only girl I can run with.  
You know friendship ends where love begins.  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
You know friendship ends where love begins,  
So stay my friend and go,go away.  
Go away,go away.go away....

Well, you can't be my lovin' baby  
You ain't got the style  
I'm gonna get some real gone love  
That'll drive a cool cat wild  
We gotta move, roll and run on down  
Gonna get me a gal, then I go out on the town  
Well, I'll move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
And when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go  
Well, I'm gonna show you ain't so hot  
I'm gonna get what you ain't got  
She'll be sweet, won't do me wrong  
She'll be cool and twice as gone  
We're gonna roll, move and run on down  
I'm gonna get me a gal, make some time  
Well, I wanna move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go  
Well, I wanna move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go

My Lovely woman child  
I found you out running wild with someone new  
You've been untrue, And everybody knows we're through  
  
But I can't say goodbye to you, No matter what you do  
My heart won't let you go, Although I know you go  
With someone new, I think of you  
  
I think of how you kiss, Your tenderness  
With all of this, I miss the way you say goodnight  
  
Bittersweet, your kisses, When my heart still misses  
The way that things used to be, But I know you're strong for  
Other arms you long for, And you can never come back to me  
  
Not just for yesterday, tonight or tomorrow  
Ah, but forever  
I'll hear you say goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight turned out to be a lie  
And I can't help it if I cry  
Goodnight my love, Sleep tight my love  
Goodnight

Your life begins when teardrops start, a broken toy, a broken heart  
All of these things are just a part of growing up  
From kiddie cars to walking shoes from lullabyes to lonely blues  
Somehow you never quite get used to growing up  
Yeah Yeah you're growing up, yeah Yeah you're growing up  
It's good to know you're growing up.  
  
The wheel of fortune takes a spin  
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win  
But you must play the game again  
Drink another cup,You're growing up.  
Yeah Yeah you're growing up, yeah yeah you're growing up  
It's good to know you're growing up.  
  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one you're growing up  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one you're growing up.  
To be a man, to be a woman to understand, takes a lot of growing, growing up  
You'll live to learn, you'll learn to live, you'll give to love your love to
give  
And when you're wise enough you'll know, you're growing up

Hey, hound dog man,  
Where you been now,where you been?  
I wish that you were back,  
It was too good to ever end.  
Once in a while someone like you  
Will give everything for what you wanted to do.  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend play it again.  
  
You gave the world a whole lot of joy  
Now that ain't bad for a country boy  
I just knew you could not lose  
The way you sang rock and roll and blues.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again  
  
Sometimes I think about James Dean,  
Sammy Cooke and my teenage queen.  
Doo ron, de ron, de ron,  
Marilyn Monroe and hot rod fun.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings.

My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend why did it end?  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend, why did it end.

I'm gonna move into  
A house without windows  
So I won't see you walking by, walking by  
With your new love  
  
There in the darkness of  
My house without windows  
I will never see the stars that shine  
Shine on you, and your new love  
  
I'd rather wonder through this endless night  
Than to face the light of another lonely day  
Knowing that you won't be there  
There to share, these two arms ever again  
  
I'll take all my broken dreams  
And I'll take my broken heart  
And from now on you will find me there  
Crying there, trying to forget  
In my house without windows  
In my house without windows  
And without love

How do you start over again?  
Tell me, where do you begin?  
What does a loser do  
When love seems lost?  
When bridges are burning  
can they still be crossed?  
  
How do you start over,over again?  
How do you begin what's already been?  
  
When love was young,we knew our love would last  
But now our dreams are somewhere in the past  
And I don't know which way to go  
I only know I miss you so  
And wish somehow it could be  
the way it was with you and me  
Remember when  
How do you start over,over again?  
  
How do you make love when the feeling is gone?  
How do you make wrong right,when right seems so wrong?  
  
Just tell me you love me and then  
We can start over, over again

Hooked on the touch of your hand, high on how you understand  
Lost when you whispered "hello" ,something in your eyes said "don't go"  
  
I just had to stay, couldn't go away from you, you knew what to do to get me  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you  
  
You knew, the first time we met that I could never forget  
You held me so close to you, I could never get over you  
  
You were so aware how to make me care and keep me  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you  
  
Yeah, you got me where you wanted me, I am where I really want to be  
Hung up,hung up,hung up on you  
  
I'm so hung up on you that I don't know what I would do without you  
Oh it will take me forever to get enough of you and I can't help it if I'm  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you baby,hung up on you  
Hung up on you,hung up on you...

Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart was at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
A memory from the past came slowly stealing  
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you (yeah)  
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you  
  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

I don't believe you when you say there's nothing wrong  
And you can't hide the tears in your eyes from me  
Don't you know we've been together much too long  
Please don't hide it,oh baby can't you see  
CHORUS  
That I care, Yes I care,And I swear I do, Oh I do, oh I do  
I really do love you, Oh I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do  
Oh I do, Yes I do, I really do want you  
Would it matter if I told you I was sorry  
For all the little things I didn't do for you  
And if you ever left me girl don't you know I'd worry  
You know all I ever wanted was you  
And I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do, And I do, oh I do  
I really do love you, Oh I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do  
Oh I do, Yes I do, I really do want you  
BRIDGE  
Oh I want you to want me too  
Just to love me just to love me  
CHORUS  

We were going together for a long long time and it breaks my heart girl  
To see you walking with some other guy  
I been sitting alone here with a worried head  
I've been talking to some downtown girls but don't believe the things that I
have said  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really love you, I don't really want you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you  
  
Now we're hitting the daylight, morning looking sad  
Never knew a guy could feel as lonely as I'm feelin oh so bad  
Time is going slowly dragging like a weight  
Like to say I'm sorry but deep down in my heart it's just too late  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really want you, I don't really need you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you  
  
We were going together for a long long time  
And it breaks my heart girl to see you walking with some other guy  
Still I keep on trying lonely as I've been  
Got to get your sweet, sweet smile to get that lovin feeling back again  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really want you, I don't really need you, I don't want to have you,  
I don't really love you, I don't really want you I don't really need you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you

I had to escape , the city was sticky and cruel  
Maybe I should have called you first  
But I was dying to get to you  
  
I was dreaming while I drove  
The long straight road ahead  
Uh-huh, yeah  
  
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night, crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night  
  
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?  
No matter where I go  
I hear the beating of our one heart  
I think about you when the night is cold and dark  
Uh-huh, yeah  
  
No one can move me the way that you do  
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
  
I drove all night, crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night  
  
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night, crept in your room  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night

I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i needed money ''cause i had none  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I left my baby and i feel so bad, i guess my race is run  
She's the best girl i ever had, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i was robbing people with a six gun  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I miss my baby and good fun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i left my baby and i feel so bad  
I guess my race is run, she's the best girl i ever had  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won

Well, if you want someone to tear your world apart  
Someone who will give it everything she's got  
If you wanna learn to cry, I recommend her  
If you want someone who's really qualified  
Guaranteed broken heart every time  
If you wanna learn to cry, don't let this chance pass you by  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you  
she's had plenty of experience along this line, oh, so many times  
She's torn apart this heart of mine, it's fascinating  
The way she operates  
She'll put you down when you think you're finally getting someplace  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you, yes I do  
If you want your dreams to end before they begin  
Someone who will ruin your life and then laugh while you cry  
Don't let this chance pass you by  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you  
I recommend her, I recommend her  
I recommend her, I recommend her  

Flowers have blooms, the oceans have waves.  
The sky has the clouds, people have babes  
I want to live, 'till i get old  
I want to watch all of this grow.  
  
I want to live, live and let live.  
I want the love this life has to give.  
I want to smile and be friendly with you.  
I want to live and let you live some too  
  
Rover is big, teddy is small.  
Betty is short, jimmy is tall.  
They want to live, live and let live.  
They want all the love this life has to give.  
They want to smile be friendly with you.  
They want to live that you live too.

I don't lose my blues  
When I pretend you're with me  
Though I make believe  
I'm still alone  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool, that's why I cried over you  
I was a fool, I only wanted you  
  
When I smile so gay, everybody knows  
That I've lost my love  
But that's the way it goes  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool, that's why I cried over you  
I was a fool, I only wanted you

For awhile, I can sing  
All the world and everything  
Is touching you  
Knowing you are real  
A miracle beside me  
For awhile, I can breathe  
Life is you and I can  
Cling to fantasies  
Seeing me with you  
Keeps my soul alive now  
Tomorrow, if I die  
At least I'll know why I live  
You're mine  
If only for awhile  
For awhile, for awhile  
You hold my world and you can spin it  
For awhile, for awhile  
Life is good because you're in it  
Tomorrow, if I die  
At least I'll know why I live  
You're mine, you are mine  
If only for awhile  

Don't talk about her, she does the best she can  
Don't talk about her, Don't talk about her  
She's just lost her man  
She's lonely, just try and understand.  
  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all  
Don't you know that she's had a bad, bad fall  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all.  
  
Don't talk about her, because she feels that way  
Don't talk about her, don't talk about her  
She don't feel so good today  
She's crying, because her baby walked away.  
  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all  
Don't you know that she's had a bad, bad fall  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all.

Too many quarrels so now we break up.  
No there's no chance to ever make-up,  
But when they ask me.  
  
I'll say it's my fault.  
I'll take all the blame.  
I'll say I was wild,  
When I should have been tame.  
  
I'll say it's my fault.  
I'll give a good show.  
I'll say I'm a needle  
That just wouldn't sew.  
  
Every one will be wondering,  
All our friends will inquire.  
Which one did the blundering,  
Who put out the fire?  
  
So, I'll say it's my fault.  
I'll say there's no doubt,  
Then cry as I wonder,  
Why it didn't work out.

Send me a pan of corn bread  
With some turnip greens on the side  
And if you really want to mess with my head  
Give me anything southern fried  
  
Give me some faded blue jeans  
And a pair of old cowboy boots  
And I'm gonna tell you where I come from  
Tell you somethin' about my roots  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
  
Send me a woman to love me  
With a lot of meat on her bones  
There's something about a big lady  
I just can't leave 'em alone  
  
I'd like to take her down to the river  
Go skinny dippin' in the night  
Ain't nothin' like being with my lady  
And makin' love in the pale moon light  
  
'Cause I'm a southern man, ah ah ah  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
I'm a southern man  
  
Give me that soulful music  
It sure makes me feel so nice  
So I can do the alligator  
And get it on every Saturday night  
  
Give me that Southern Comfort  
Give me Annie Greenspring's wine  
Take me on down to the bayou  
and I'll sure have a real good time  
  
'Cause I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man  
  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
I'm a southern man  
Southern man

Dumb-dee-dumb-dee-dumb-ooh-yeah-yeah,  
Oh, I'm hurtin'.  
  
Felt this way,yesterday,  
Today, I keep hurtin', yeah, hurtin'.  
  
Time goes by, right on by,  
And I, I'm still hurtin', yeah, hurtin'.  
  
You walked away, and the pain began.  
I knew I'd never, love again.  
  
Oh, my heart, tore apart  
And I'm sure hurtin' yeah hurtin'.  
  
You walked away, and the pain began.  
I knew I'd never, love again.  
  
Seems to me my destiny  
Is to be just hurtin'  
Yeah, hurtin'.

I'm in a blue blue mood  
Now that you're gone away  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
It's been a lonesome day  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I miss your caress  
I reach out to hold you  
But you're not there  
It's just my blue blue mood  
  
Maybe, someday, yeah love will come  
And stay, and things will turn  
How bright, oh oh oh but for tonight  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I'm in a blue blue mood

Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill?  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is whining low  
And I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
Did you ever see a night so long  
When time goes crawlin' by?  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
And I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep  
When leaves begin to die?  
That means he's lost the will to live  
And I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
The silence of a fallin' star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
Yeah I-I could cry-eye-eye  
I could cry-eye, eye-eye-eye, I-I could cry-eye  
I could cry-eye, oh-oh-oh-oh  
I-I could cry, I could cry

Morning comes into my room through pretty purple curtains  
And looks upon a man so satisfied  
I hold a woman in my arms and watch her while she's sleeping  
And I know that I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I'm the pretty dress she buys  
I'm the little bug she drives  
I'm the picture that she shows  
To everybody that she knows  
I'm the wiggle in her walk  
I'm the giggle in her talk  
I'm the happy little song she sings  
She wears my love for all to see  
Sail on by silver moon  
I won't follow you this time  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I'm the stops on her way home  
I'm the dime in the telephone  
I'm the honey that she talks about  
I'm old meanie when she pouts  
I'm the carpet beneath her feet  
Every night before she sleeps  
I'm the pillow where she lays her head  
I'm the last word that she said  
Sail on by silver moon  
I won't follow you this time  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  

A candy-colored clown they call the sandman  
Tiptoes to my room every night  
Just to sprinkle star dust and to whisper  
"Go to sleep, everything is alright"  
  
I close my eyes then I drift away  
Into the magic night, I softly say  
A silent prayer like dreamers do  
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you  
  
In dreams I walk with you  
In dreams I talk to you  
In dreams you're mine all the time  
We're together in dreams, in dreams  
  
But just before the dawn  
I awake and find you gone  
I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry  
I remember that you said goodbye  
  
It's too bad it only seems  
It only happens in my dreams  
Only in dreams  
In beautiful dreams.

In dreams we do so many things  
We set aside the rules we know  
And fly the world so high  
In great and shining rings  
  
If only we could always live in dreams  
If only we could make of life  
What, in dreams, it seems  
  
But in the real world  
We must say our goodbyes  
No matter if the love will live  
It will never die  
  
In the real world  
There are things that we can't change  
And endings come to us  
In ways that we can't rearrange  
  
I love you, and you love me  
But sometimes we must let it be  
In the real world  
In the real world  
  
When we were dreaming heart to heart  
I wish that we had stayed right there  
For when the dreamers do awake  
The dreams do disappear  
  
In the real world  
There are things that we can't change  
And endings come to us  
In ways that we can't rearrange  
  
I love you, and you love me  
But sometimes we must let it be  
In the real world  
In the real world

You were a lady - like lady I was a boy running wild  
The way that you used everything that god gave you  
I gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven  
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you
took me back to heaven again  
  
And I remember the Indian summer how you held me, how you loved me (Loved me
loved me)  
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong  
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to
tell you the truth  
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die  
Just to hear you that sees me through, oh what I'd give to re-live all the
Indian Summers with you  
  
So many hearts have been broken (Dum dumb dumb dumb-by Do Wah)  
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking (but then)  
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing  
Just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an Indian Summer
at 110 in the shade  
  
And I remember (and I remember) The Indian Summer  
How you held me in the moonlight  
  
We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head  
and if I'd known I'd lose you the moment I found you I'd love you all over
again  
  
'cause I'm still empty (I'm still empty) Come fill me ( Come fill me)  
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame 'cause it's all I want to do  
  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you-oooooooooooooooooo

There once was an Indian brave by the name of Yellow Hand  
He fell in love with a maiden know as White Sands  
They vowed their love would last forever more  
Then came the day that they had waited for.  
  
Yellow Hand brought her a golden feather  
White Sands said a prayer for good weather  
The ceremonial dance grew loud and strong  
Then Yellow Hand began their wedding song.  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight, We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, come hold my lonely hand.  
  
Then they left the warmth of the raging fire  
And rode into the hills climbing higher  
And suddenly the snow came swirling down  
They were lost the trail could not be found.  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, Come hold my lonely hand.  
  
They never returned from Paradise  
They went to their places in the sky  
And the old ones still say when the snowflakes fly  
If you'll listen close you'll hear him cry:  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, Come hold my lonely hand

You tell me to find somebody new.  
That you're not for me I'm not for you.  
It don't matter if you're right or wrong.  
It ain't not big thing just say "so long"  
  
It's been fun and laughter all the way.  
I will live to love another day.  
I will be alright can't you tell?.  
It ain't not big thing just say "farewell"  
  
It ain't not big thing I won't be blue.  
Just so you're happy and your dreams come true.  
It ain't not big thing my losing you.  
Just ain't no big thing, I'll get over you.  
  
It ain't not big thing to see you go.  
It ain't not big thing that you don't know.  
It ain't not big thing I've been lying.  
It ain't not big thing that I'm crying.  
It ain't not big thing that I'm dying

Man by himself lives in a world a world of his own  
But there's no one who can live in the world all alone  
For it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
The good, the bad, and everyone  
  
On the way up, a man can walk over his friends  
What goes up comes down  
One day he may need them again  
For it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
The good, the bad, and everyone  
  
There'll come the day when everyone passes him by  
What will he say when nobody answers his cry?  
That it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
It may take some time  
But each man will find  
That he needs all kinds of people  
That he must believe in people  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
To make a world

It wasn't very long ago.  
I met you,I saw you.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
You whispered "I love you"  
  
Look at us now.  
Crying our hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like, although...  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I thrilled when I kissed you.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I cried when I missed you  
  
Look at us now.  
Crying at hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like  
Although It wasn't very long ago.  
  
Look look my eyes aren't shining with love  
And they won't.  
Look I'm not crying 'cause I need you,  
I'm crying 'cause I don't, oh  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I held you, so closely.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
I dreamed of,you mostly  
  
Look us now.  
Crying at hearts out through the night.  
Trying to remember what love was like.  
Although it wasn't very long ago.  
  
It wasn't very long ago.  
It wasn't very long ago.  
Not so very long ago..

Your baby doesn't love you any more  
Golden days before they end  
Whisper secrets to the wind  
Your baby won't be near you any more  
  
Tender nights before they fly  
Send falling stars that seem to cry  
Your baby doesn't want you any more  
It's over  
  
It breaks your heart in two, To know she's been untrue  
But oh what will you do? Then she said to you  
There's someone new We're through We're through  
It's over It's over It's over  
  
All the rainbows in the sky Start to even say goodbye  
You won't be seeing rainbows any more  
Setting suns before they fall, Echo to you that's all that's all  
But you'll see lonely sunset after all  
  
It's over It's over It's over It's over

I've been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
You're tired and you wanna be free  
My love is growing stronger  
As you become a habit to me  
Ooh, and loving you a little too long  
I don't wanna stop right now  
Oh, with you my life has been so wonderful  
I just can't stop now  
You're tired and your love is growing cold  
My love is growing stronger  
As our affair grows old  
And I've been loving you just a little too long  
I don't wanna stop now  
Ooh, ooh, and loving you  
Loving you a little too long  
Don't wanna stop now  
Ooh, ooh, too long, long  
Don't wanna stop my loving you right now  
No, oh, I've been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
Ooh, ooh, loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
No, oh, I can't stop now, no  
Loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  

Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Long ago we were strollin' together  
All the shores and the drive-in's we did see  
Now she spends all her time with another  
But I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
  

Jolie...  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Pretty little french girl I met in Paris  
Jolie cute as she could be  
Throwing me her kisses from her balcony  
  
She had come hither eyes  
And charm from her head to her feet  
Really my Jolie was neat  
Golly my Jolie was sweet  
  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Wish I had my Jolie over here with me  
  
She had come hither eyes  
And charm from her head to her feet  
Really my Jolie was neat  
Golly my Jolie was sweet  
  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Wish I had my Jolie over here with me  
  
Wish I hadn't left her over in Paris  
On her balcony  
Jolie my Cherie  
Jolie, Jolie, Jolie, Jolie...

Well, you can act like a monkey  
Shake your hands, do the limbo till you can't stand  
Well, you can mash your potato, hippy hippy shake  
But the beats still wild and your feet still ache  
I say, it's just another name for rock and roll, everybody, everybody sing  
It's just another name for rock and roll, rock and roll  
Well, you can do the duck, walk your dog  
Down the street, loop the loop to a swingin' beat  
You can twist and shout and do the stomp  
A chase a chicken on a pony romp but  
It's just another name for rock and roll, everybody everybody sing  
It's just another name for rock and roll, rock and roll  
Well, they all try to shake it another way  
But they rock, they roll just the same  
They only call it by another name  
And I don't care what they say  
Down in the jungle where the tree tops are steep  
They get the fever for a bongo beat, they do the ubangie stomp  
The safari hop, do the monkey until they drop  
But it's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing  
It's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing  
It's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing  

If your love for me is just temporary  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
And if I'm not in your plans for a lifetime  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
Just like a child at play  
I'll make believe you'll stay  
And if you go away  
I'll always miss my best playmate  
  
So if your sweet kiss is just for the moment  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
Just let me make believe a while

Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh, how it'd ease my troubled mind  
If I could hold you just one time  
And then pretend that you're still mine  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Wish I could really one more time  
Turn back the pages in there I'd find  
That same old love that once was mine  
Wish I could see you just one time  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  

Kaw-Liga was a wooden indian standing by the door  
He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk  
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk  
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign  
Because his heart was made of knotty pine  
  
Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss  
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red?  
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head  
  
Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere  
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss  
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red?  
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head  
  
Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid  
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed  
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be  
And wishes he was still an old pine tree  
  
Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss  
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red?  
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head  
  
Kaw-liga, Kaw-liga Kaw-Liga...

You can take it to the country you can take it to town  
Take it on the run in the back of some car  
Take it too far if you leave it all around  
Someday you're gonna lose it baby now now  
CHORUS  
You better lay it down  
Right where I can see it  
Lay it down  
You gotta lay it down  
Show me that you mean it  
Lay it down  
You can see it on fire you can burn it to the ground  
You can take it down to hell and back to heaven again  
But I won't take it back if you leave it all around  
To all the king horses and all the king s men  
You better lay it down  
Right where I can see it

Le-Leah, Leah! Le-Leah, Leah!  
Here I go,  
From the hut to the boat, to the sea  
For Leah.  
  
Ah-hah, I gotta go diving in the bay,  
Gotta get a lot of oysters, find some pearls today,  
To make a pretty necklace for Leah,  
Le-e-ah.  
  
I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right,  
I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight.  
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me,  
Le-e-ah.  
  
But something's wrong, I cannot move around,  
My leg is caught, it's pulling me down,  
But I'll keep my hand shut tight, for if they find me,  
They'll find the pearl for Leah.  
  
And now it's over, I'm awake at last,  
Old heartaches and memories from the past.  
It was just another dream about my lost love,  
'Bout Le-e-ah.  
  
Le-Leah, Leah! Le-Leah, Leah!  
Here I go,  
Back to sleep, and in my dreams, I'll dream  
With Leah, Leah, Le-ah!

Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul,  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
Come on baby and a listen to this, this is a something you just can't miss  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long

The night is bright and gay but I'm so blue  
My heart must have it's way and dream of you  
That's why I sigh and sip my lonely wine  
  
Your picture on the wall your smiling face  
Brings back the memory of your embrace  
I start to cry into my lonely wine  
  
Teardrops fall but all they bring is heartache  
It's better if I never think at all  
Still they soothe the pain my lonely thoughts make  
I never quite succeed in hiding all, so let them fall  
  
Where ever you may be, I'll still be true  
And when the clouds roll by I'll come to you  
But until then I'll drink my lonely wine

Lonesome Number One,just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won,I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Every love I've had has faded like the dew  
Every one I've wanted, has wanted someone new  
Heartaches hang around and always come  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
It seems I'm always losing, love just can't come near  
Just when love gets close it always disappears  
Sorrow always keeps me on the run  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
Just call me Lonesome Number One, here I come I'm Lonesome Number One

Love hurts  
Love scars, love wounds and mars  
  
Any heart not touched  
or strong enough  
can take a lot of pain  
Take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud  
Holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
  
I'm young, I know  
But even so  
I know a thing, or two  
I've learned from you  
  
I really learned a lot  
Really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove  
Burns you when its hot  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
  
Some fools rave of happiness  
Blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves I guess  
But they're not fooling me  
  
I know it isn't true  
Know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts  
Love hurts  
Love hurts

They say the heart must feel it all.  
Know every rise and everyfall.  
To earn the right to stand in sunlight.  
Someday the sun will always shine.  
Deep down inside this heart of mine.  
And it will be my time.  
  
Rivers keep flowing.  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me.  
I walk alone.  
Hard rain keep fallin'  
Lost souls keep callin' so lonely.  
I hope I find.  
Love in time  
Love in time.  
  
You know a man can't always choose.  
Love has its rhythm and its blues.  
I hope it's there for me.  
  
Rivers keep flowing.  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me.  
I walk alone.  
Hard rains keep callin' so lonely.  
I hope I find .  
Love in time.  
Love in time.  
  
I hope I find it.  
Shinin' somewhere  
Somewhere out there.  
There will be love in time.  
In time.  
  
Rivers keep flowing (again this part)...

Love Star, oh star of love have you forgotten me?  
I'm so lonely for someone to love  
Love Star, oh star of love look down so you may see  
Someone for me like I'm dreaming of  
  
You see because my heart is shy  
Somehow love has passed me by  
And no one knows how much I cry  
When I'm all alone for a love of my own  
  
Love Star, they say for every heart a love star shines  
So please, please shine for mine and let me find my love.  
  
You see because my heart is shy  
Somehow love has passed me by  
And no one knows how much I cry  
When I'm all alone for a love of my own  
  
Love Star, they say for every heart a love star shines  
So please, please shine for mine and let me find my love.

What a life what a day I'm in love all the way  
I'm in good with lady luck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
I'm in love ah hah I'm in love oh yeah  
Well I feel like I was hit by a truck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
  
Well true love came just in time, in time to save this heart of mine  
Cupid came and I forgot to duck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
I'm in love ah hah I'm in love oh yeah  
Well look at me grin and watch me strut ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck

But there's one or two things I forgot to say  
I'm glad that I met lady luck, I'm glad that I forgot to duck  
And I'm glad that I've been lovestruck

Mama, just had to call, oh mama  
Your baby boy just had his heart  
Broken in two, she said were through  
But to send her best to you.  
Oh mama, I'd like to run to you mama  
I'd come home today, leave right away  
But things won't work that way  
Gotta stay, and be a man  
If I can, oh mama.  
  
No mom, I don't know I called her tonight  
No, not at home, yeah, you're probably right  
Yes I'll take care of myself. No I'll be alright  
I'll go to bed early tonight.  
Oh mama, tell dad I think of him, mama  
Hows uncle Joe, my puppy go-go  
Tell them hello, oh I'd better go  
But good gosh, I loved her so.  
  
Oh mama, don't worry so much, darling mama  
Now mama don't cry, just say goodbye  
Can't have us both in tears well mom, you know me  
Yes I'll always be your baby through all the years.

Crazy heart your baby's gone, don't you know?.  
Empty arms give up, give up, come on let go.  
And maybe I will be alright.  
And maybe I'll get through tonight.  
Then maybe I will see you tomorrow.  
  
Misty eyes don't see that face in every tear.  
Longing lips don't speak that name, there's no one here.  
And maybe I will see the dawn.  
And maybe I'll get by alone.  
Then maybe I will lose my sorrow.  
  
In a hundred years trough a million tears,  
Maybe,maybe.  
Maybe I'll be loving you.  
And maybe when my life is through  
Then maybe I'll get over you.  
Maybe,maybe,maybe.

If you'll bring Wildflower to me  
Medicine Man,Make your magic mine

Go into your sacred dance  
Say a prayer for our romance  
And make Wildflower mine  

Long Distance Information, give me Memphis, Tennessee.  
Help me find the party that tried to get in touch with me.  
They would not leave a number, but I know the place to call,  
Cause my uncle took a message, and he wrote it on the wall.  
  
Long Distance Information, get in touch with my Marie.  
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee.  
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge,  
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge.  
  
Long Distance Information, more than that I cannot add.  
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had.  
But we were torn apart because her Mom did not agree,  
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Now, last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye,  
With "hurry home" drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes.  
Marie is only 6 years old. Information, please,  
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Yes, oh, yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge. I'll pay.  
But which loved one is calling me? I did not hear you say.  
Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie.  
It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know.  
Surely you have not forgot how much I love you so.  
If you would remember, dear, and sometimes talk to me.  
Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee.  
  
Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave.  
You didn't want to see me off, and promised not to grieve.  
My heart was torn apart, as I looked back at Marie.  
And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee.  
  
I Guess I should stop talking, after all, you placed the call.  
But any way that I can help. you know I'll help you all.  
Then her mother told me to come back and see Marie,  
And live together in our home in Memphis, Tennessee.  
  

They say the best things in life are free  
But you can give them to the birds and bees  
I need money, that's what I want

Though what it won't buy I can't use

When you my friend are wrong.  
Not to do what you want to  
Just because it's wrong.  
  
Well then my friend in passing.  
We've been friends too long.  
And I my friend must tell you,  
Leave that woman alone.  
  
Your little girls might not understand,  
And you know the baby would cry.  
And what would you do if their mommy knew,  
And she told you "goodbye"?  
  
Let it end my friend say it's over,  
And thank the stars above.  
That you've got a home to run to,  
And a sweet sweet woman to love.  
I must say my friend if you stay my friend.  
Leave that woman alone.leave my woman alone.

When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing  
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart  
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray  
  
My prayer is to linger with you  
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine  
My prayer is a rapture in blue  
With the world far away and your lips close to mine  
  
Tonight while our hearts are aglow  
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know  
  
My prayer and the answer you give  
May they still be the same for as long as we live  
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer

A new sweet song of love has got you off my mind  
I've found the new love who will walk the line  
Every night and every day  
I give all my love away  
To someone who can love me all the time  
  
Never again, to be lonely again  
Never again  
Heartaches have left me now forever  
  
I've burned the old love letters that you wrote to me  
Discovered love i thought could never be  
A love as sweet as wine  
Keeps you off my mind  
I said goodbye to my misery  
  
Memories will never bother me again  
And when i think of things that might have been  
I just pledge my love to my new love  
And then we kiss again  
  
And oh, what a feeling just to know  
That never again, never again, never again  
I've found a love to last forever  
I true love who will leave me never  
  
Never, never, never  
Never, never, never  
Never, never, never....

When shadows fall, the day is done  
The mountain tops hide the setting sun  
The magic of the night is here, for all young lovers far and near  
  
Night life, ooh la la la, stars coming out to play  
Night life, rah rah rah rah  
See how they light the milky way  
At the end of day, mmm night life  
  
Night life, aye aye aye aye look at the moon above  
Night life, ma ma ma ma, it's time to fall in love  
Yeah, so come on, mmm night life  
  
Night life, no need to be blue  
The moon and the stars are belong to you  
Night life is so much fun when you're in love, and love is young  
  
Night life tra la la la, laughing and painting the town  
Night life, ha ha ha ha, it's just a merry go round  
When the sun goes down, mmm night life

No one will ever know my heart is breaking  
Although a million teardrops start to fall  
I'll try myself to sleep and wake up smiling  
I miss you but no one will ever know  
  
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other  
And realized our dreams could never be  
  
I'll even make believe I never loved you  
Then no one will ever know the truth but me  
  
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other  
And realized our dreams could never be  
  
I'll even make believe I never loved you  
Then no one will ever know the truth but me

You always said that I'd be back again  
That I'd come running to you in the end  
I thought that you were on your own  
And now I find you're not alone  
(Chorus)  
I'll see you through the rain  
Through the heartache and pain  
It hurts like never before  
You're not alone any more  
You always said that I would know someday  
Just how it feels when your love walks away  
I let you down I let you go  
I lost you, how was I to know  
(Chorus)  
I never knew I could feel this way  
I never could see past yesterday  
You feel that everything is gone  
I feel it too, you're not alone  
(Chorus)  

Oh, such a stranger, you don't even know me  
It's just as though we never even met  
Oh, such a stranger, you don't even see me  
Tell me was I that easy to forget?  
Don't you remember, please won't you try?  
Was it that long ago, you brought tears to my eyes?  
Oh, such a stranger, we're not even friends  
Don't you even remember me when?  
Oh, such a stranger, we're not even friends  
Don't you even remember me when?  

(Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah, ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)  
  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know the way I feel tonight (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know this feeling ain't right (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
  
There goes my baby, there goes my heart  
They're gone forever, so far apart  
But only the lonely know wh-why-why I cry, only the lonely  
(Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah, ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)  
(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)  
  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know the heartaches I've been through (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
Know I cry and cry for you (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)  
  
Maybe tomorrow a new romance  
No-o-o more sorrow, but that's the chance  
You've got to take, if your lonely heart breaks  
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)

I can paint a sunset across the sky of blue  
Only with you, Only with you  
I can be a master at anything I do  
Only with you, Only with you  
  
I found the end of the rainbow my golden treasure too  
Only with you, Only with you  
The sun looks good in the morning and I love the night time too  
Only with you, Only with you  
  
All my world would end dear my rising star would fall  
If ever I should lose you I would be nothing at all  
  
All my world is heaven I'll be happy my whole life through  
Only with you, Only with you

Only you can make, oh, this world seem right  
Only you can make the darkness bright  
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do  
And fill my heart with love for only you.  
  
Only you can make, oh, this change on me  
Oh it's true you are my destiny  
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do  
You're my dream come true, my one and only you  
  
Only you can make, oh, this change on me  
Oh it's true you are my destiny  
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do  
You're my dream come true, my one and only you

Well you won't be a struttin' 'cause now ya know

Well thanks a lot thank you  
Now I'm the talk of the town  
Of all the fools they drink to  
I am the king of the clowns  
I play the lonely joker  
I take what fun I can find  
I laugh when things aren't funny  
I throw away my last dime  
You're not mine so I waste my time in pantomime.  
It's pantomime.  
  
I'm ready for lonely fun times, yeah  
Loud music may dull my mind  
Black coffee and electric sunshine  
Get set for this pantomime.  
  
I-ay-ay-ay cry inside cause you're not mine  
I-ay die-ay-ay-ay inside cause you're not mine  
I pantomime.  
  
Laughing when I feel like crying  
Crying when I feel like dying  
You're not mine so I waste my time in pantomime  
Bring on the girls and the parties, yeah  
Guitars and drums beating time  
Be merry, be gay and hardy, yeah  
I'm set for this pantomime.

You've got a party heart, a gay time party heart  
You're only happy when the party's going on  
And it makes me sad because I know that party's have to end  
And when this party's over, you'll be gone  
  
I love your party heart your playful party heart  
But though you make me laugh you also make me cry  
'Cause I know you only think of me as just a party friend  
And when the party's done you'll say goodbye  
  
A playtime girl like you plays lots of thrills in life it seems  
But oh, what I'd ever give to be the playboy of your dreams  
I'd tame your party heart, your fickle party heart  
And someday that's just what some party boy will do  
  
But I love you so, I guess that I'll cry just as much as you  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two...

A light shown in the night some way ahead, blue turned into green then it was
red  
And stirring the night love music played the light I saw in the night was a
penny arcade  
  
Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
At first I thought it a dream that I was in, lost, lost in a sea of glass and
tin  
But no, so dipping my hand in the back of my jeans I grabbed a handful of
coins to feed the machine  
  
Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
Oh! step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
Roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend
your last dime!

I read your letter just this morning  
The first you've wrote since you've been gone  
You've found a good life in California  
You've finally found yourself a home  
  
You've bought a new car, a great big red one  
With a top that rolls right down  
You must be something in San Francisco  
A dressed up, painted country clown  
  
You're fakin' it well, but it's easy to tell  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and you're out of your class  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
  
You know I love you, at least you ought to  
I've loved you all of my livin' days  
You got no business makin' changes  
Yeah girl, I love your country ways  
  
Go sell that red car, catch an airplane  
And i'll be waiting when you land  
Yeah, get a white dress, find a preacher  
We'll get some rings to fit your hand  
  
You're fakin' it well, but it's easy to tell  
You're plain jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and you're out of your class  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
You're plain Jane country come to town

You've broken my heart in two  
You told a hundred lies

(The pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue)  
  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write "I love you"  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Crowded street, busy feet hustle by him  
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh  
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk  
Hoping that you won't pass him by  
  
Should you stop, better not, much too busy  
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly  
In the distance the ringing of laughter  
And in the midst of the laughter he cries  
  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write "I love you"  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Pretty woman, walking down the street  
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet  
Pretty woman  
I don't believe you, you're not the truth  
No one could look as good as you  
Mercy  
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?

Pretty woman

Are you lonely just like me?

Yeah, she's walking back to me  
Oh, oh, pretty woman
