Strange town, shake down  
Sink or swim  
Old flames, stage names  
Shed your skin  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
  
Long gone, house young  
Memories  
Closed doors, cold wars  
You and me  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
When will you ever  
make up your mind (come on) [Repeat: x3]  
  
Jaded, elated  
Time of day  
Time out, freak out  
Games we play  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
When will you ever  
make up your mind (come on)[Repeat: x7]

Here come dick, he's wearing a skirt  
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain  
Same hair, revolution  
Same build, evolution  
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss  
  
And they love each other so  
Androgynous  
Closer than you know, love each other so  
Androgynous  
  
Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad  
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad  
And she don't need advice that he send to her  
She's happy with the way she looks  
She's happy with her gender  
  
Mirror image, see no damage  
See no evil at all  
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls  
They'll be laughed at  
The way you're laughed at now  
  
Now, something meets Boy, and something meets Girl  
They both look the same  
They're overjoyed in this world  
Same hair, revolution  
Unisex, evolution  
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss  
And tomorrow dick is wearing pants  
And tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress  
Future outcasts and they don't last  
And today, the people dress the way that they please  
The way they tried to do in the last centuries

When will it stop raining? When will these dark clouds go?  
Some days I get so low, but you turn me around, you turn me around  
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light  
'cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light  
'cause I need your sweet sunshine  
You take away my sadness and the pain inside my heart  
  
Sometimes I fall apart, but you turn me around, you turn me around  
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light  
'cause I need your sweet sunshine  
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light

Sunshine

And never leave my sky again  
Shine your love light, love light, love light, love light  
Down on me, down on me

Watch me, make you  
Let me, take you  
Follow down, I will penetrate you baby  
Run you to the ground  
I will make you hate you baby

I'll leave the bones and hair to rot

Run you into the ground (Let me)  
I will make you hate you baby

She was looking right through me like I was made out of glass  
A la la la la la  
Heaven, lie and tell, comes back like up at a check  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get  
  
Smokin' and drinkin', tryin' to kick stuff Monday night  
Smokin' and drinkin', tryin' to kick start Monday night  
I try and I try  
A sneaky feeling is coming over me  
  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
  
She said "boy, you take, you take me somehow, I don't know who you are
anymore.  
I don't know who you are anymore"  
(break)  
Too many complications, conversations that go nowhere  
Get out of my my my my head, head, I see you everywhere  
  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
Why do you get so emotional?  
  
She said "boy, you take, you take me somehow, I don't know who you are

I don't know who you are anymore, I don't know who you are anymore,  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Can't believe what I've found  
I'm shellshocked  
Finding out  
When I hear her coming 'round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming 'round  
Yeah  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Daylight  
It's alright  
Even when she's gone  
'cause it won't be long  
I know everything is different  
'Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
She is music when she walks  
She's playing me a melody  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Got my feet on the ground  
I'm not losing, losing  
When I hear her coming 'round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming 'round  
Yeah  
'Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
It's like the world is turning just for me  
It's like the world is turning just for me

Long before I ever saw your face  
I got to know you in a dream  
But things aren't always what they seem  
You learn along the way  
  
I just can't stop myself from breaking down  
It's just no good unless you come around  
I turn into a monster  
all my friends agree  
  
So goodnight  
I'm going to bed  
I'm falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
I'm someone else instead  
Fallin' upstairs to you  
  
You came to me from secret place  
You're beautiful and strange to me  
Just like an antique melody  
Too sad for me to play  
  
I hope you'll wait for me behind closed eyes  
I know I'll search for you all through the night  
'Till when the dawn breaks in and throws it's light  
Around the room  
  
Goodnight  
I'm going to bed  
I'm falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
I'm somewhere else instead  
Falling upstairs to you  
Falling upstairs to you

Well, I don't wanna be President, Superman, or Clark Kent  
I don't wanna walk around in their shoes  
'Cause I don't know whose side I'm on  
I don't know my right from wrong  
I don't know where I'm goin' to  
I don't know about you  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I don't wanna make you mad  
I don't wanna meet your dad  
I don't wanna be your dream come true  
'Cause I don't know just what I've found  
I don't know my sky from ground  
I don't know where I'm goin' toI don't know about you  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  

Freeloader Freddy got a cold chevy nova  
Where he got the papers-don't know.  
Got a line on sweet act, sheer heart attack  
We're sticking close to the floor  
  
Refrain:  
How you feel, all right now  
I'm king of the road  
How you feel, red lights fading  
King for an hour, I need another.  
  
Freeloader Freddy knows all the ladies  
Standing on the corner downtown.  
Doing lines off the dash, own private stash  
Oh, the word is getting around.  
  
Refrain  
  
I'm taking my time making it mine  
I've got some people to see.  
And you want to play, you got to pay,  
Yesterday it used to be free.  
  
Refrain  
  
Assorted Ad Libs:  
It's all right, come on babe,  
Freeloader Freddy, oh yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Some words are definately wrong!

Those days when our hearts were as big as the sun  
Turn around with a smile for everyone  
That feeling's a memory  
Funny how it fades away  
You won't see those pale grays returning to blues  
The colors will wash out as I shrink in my shoes  
And I won't always live and breathe  
Watch me as I fade away  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away  
  
Who on this planet would ever refuse  
The chance of a lifetime to love and lose  
When time is of no importance  
Have you seen it slip away?  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away

I've been thinking about the good old day  
Decorated in a candy glaze  
Each pretty ink blot panel  
Tells a different tale  
Each photo on the mantel  
Sweet memories that never will go stale  
  
I've been climbing up the walls again  
Living with a memory that might have been  
So pick me up on a weekday night  
We'll get together and ride around in  
The black and white  
  
I've been thinking about the good old days  
My silly clothes and my silly ways  
Each drunken drugstore purchase  
Each chemical advance  
Seven days a weekend  
Everday the same old dizzy dance

How did I get here  
Lyin' in the sunshine  
All I have is tears  
Watch them as they fall  
I'm wishing you were here  
This was supposed to be a good time  
This was supposed to be our year  
Now there's nothing after all.  
  
How did I get here  
I guess it doesn't really matter  
I try and pass the days  
Without you on my mind  
Without you next to me  
This is feeling like a bad dream  
I'm doin' it again  
I thought about you one more time  
  
I'm sending out a message via satellite  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you right here  
We're lighting you a candle in the dead of night  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you  
  
I'm sending out a message via satellite  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you right  
Lighting you a candle in the dead of night  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you  
  
How did I get here  
Lyin' in the sunshine  
All I have is tears  
Watch them as they fall  
How did I get here  
I guess it doesn't really matter  
Try and pass the day  
Without you on my mind  
Without you next to me  
This is feeling like a bad dream  
Now I'm doing it again  
I thought about you one more time

Too bad I don't get my own way  
Want champagne, all they got is cabernet  
And I'm wastin' all my time  
I feel good but there's a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin' from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
Red lights flashin' behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin' down and screamin' in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
I'm only here for a limited time  
Probably see me hangin' around by the railroad tracks  
I get high  
  
We used to have a house down by the shore  
Every night we'd take a walk to the liquor store  
And we'd get wasted all the time  
I hit the city when I lost ya girl  
Not so pretty it's a different world  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
Red lights flashin' behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin' down and screamin' in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
I'm only here for a limited time  
And then I got a bag to pack  
  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
  
Too bad I don't get my own way  
Maybe you and me can try to get together some day  
Because I'm wastin' all my time  
I feel good but there's a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin' from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
I get high, forget about it all  
I get high, forget about it all

Gonna steal your soul  
By remote control  
We smell and audience  
We smell money  
  
I don't need a gun  
I own the network, son  
And they love baywatch  
In istanbul yeah  
  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah

Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah  
Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah

I saw you yesterday  
I was not phased, I did not care  
You, you turned and walked away  
As if I was not even there  
  
I don't know, you don't know  
We don't know why  
I tell myself like these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I don't miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed [Repeat: x3]  
  
I don't miss you all that much  
Don't miss your kiss, don't miss your touch  
I'm so happy to be free  
I don't need you, you don't need me  
  
If you don't care, then I don't care  
Please tell my why  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I don't miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed [Repeat: x4]  
  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I don't miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I don't love you  
  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I don't miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed [Repeat: x8]

Sittin' here in your room

Shinin' through  
Broken windows I've been waitin' for ya singin'  
  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to see you cry  
  
Sittin' on the hood of your car  
Starin' up at the sky, wishin' on a fallin' star  
You come so far  
I get no response, I just keep on waiting  
  
Louie louie louie lou-ee  
When ya gonna come back home  
Louie louie louie lou-ii  
You know I hate to be alone

It doesn't kill you, it's not a one-way ticket to a lonely life  
It might break your heart, but the physical risk is low  
You might feel so bad that you wanna die  
but if you died you would never know  
that it didn't kill you  
soon you would've felt better  
are you happy in heaven?  
do you win all the games that they play up there?  
do you have a new body?  
what kind of wings do you wear?  
I haven't felt so bad that I wanted to die  
but if I died I would never know  
Love doesn't kill you  
it's supposed to make you feel better  
You're never going to feel any better  
once you're dead, you don't get any deader  
and you get no lovin' but you feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you could've been a bit bolder  
now you're never gonna get any older  
and I really do miss you, but how would you know?  
Is that the only way to go?  
Love doesn't kill you  
but you can't run away from the bare inside  
you can't just quit right right here  
you've gotta let it ride  
We've all felt so bad that we wanted to die  
but if we died we would never know  
Love doesn't kill you  
It makes you feel better  
you're not ever going to feel any better  
once you're dead you don't get any deader  
and you get no lovin', but you'll feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you could've been a bit bolder  
now you're never going to get any older  
and I really do miss you  
but how would you know?  
It's just too bad that it's too late to let it show

You can talk to me about powder-kegs  
And how I'm sittin' on one right now.  
You can warn me about candles  
With both ends burning  
From the outside, in.  
  
But, don't tell me about true love.  
Because I don't think you really know.  
  
You need to pay the cost.  
You need to feel the loss.  
'Cause love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
  
Talk to me about appearances  
I'll tell you, lately, they mean less and less.  
Do your best to keep me occupied,  
It's hard to concentrate  
I must confess.  
  
Don't you tell me about heartbreak,  
'cause it ain't written in the stars.  
  
You need to pay the cost.  
You need to feel the loss.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
  
Alright,  
You got me  
  
Don't you worry 'bout my baby,  
Her eyes are open all the time.  
I could never dare deceive her,  
Much less remove her from my mind.  
I didn't talk to you about true love.  
I didn't think you'd understand.  
  
We need to pay the cost.  
We need to feel the loss.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.  
Love is expensive and free.

Now you're pushing 31, duty calls you come and run  
Instead of  
Now you're pushing 31, duty call you come and run  
  
When will this be over, when will you be done  
Instead of  
When will this be over, when will you be gone  
  
Be a man, try to be tough  
Or  
I'll be your man, try to be tough  
Instead of  
I'll be your man child to be tough  
  
Give me twenty minutes in between  
Instead of  
Giving twenty minutes in between  
  
(Not sure about this one at all)  
You can kill yourself, or you can make your mama proud  
Instead of  
You can be yourself, well you can make your mama proud

Oh Mexico  
All the time  
Dreamin' all about Acapulco  
And a sweet thing on my mind  
  
Mogadishu sunrise  
Low above the sea  
All of those lawyers in California  
Won't bring her back to me  
  
Back to me  
Back to me  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Of all the lowdown places in the world  
To be stuck inside of a phone booth  
Hangin' on the end of a line  
While this civil war keeps ragin' in my mind  
  
Oh Mary Mary  
I think you're fine  
'Cause you can mix a margarita  
From a bottle of turpentine  
  
Just between noon and midnight  
That's when the battle rages on  
Mama I just gotta make one more call  
And I'll be here with you all night long  
  
All night long  
All night long  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Of all the lowdown places in the world  
To be livin' in another city  
Comin' from another time  
  
I know it's a cold cruel world  
But you're eyes look soft and kind  
And this civil war keeps ragin' in my mind  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl

As I wake I see a morning star  
Through the window dimly shines  
Its final statement at the closing of the day  
I've got a few more minutes of night time before I rise  
  
As the dawn is breaking through the darkness  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good  
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
As I laid down last night I felt no pain  
The day went on without a sound  
Another night to put all the business away  
I had a few more hours of night time before I'd rise  
All the stars were out last night in the sky  
I slept right through as they all went by  
  
Soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good  
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
You come along with a color that I can't match  
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached  
You're coming from the wrong direction  
  
And as I sleep tonight I'll dream of you  
Sleeping somewhere far away  
You come into my head so pretty and so true  
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise  
As the fireworks shoot off in the sky  
I sleep right through as it all goes by  
  
Soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn  
The morning star will fade but never die  
Morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good  
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood  
  
You come along with a code that I can't crack  
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached  
You were coming from the wrong direction  
  
You were coming from the wrong direction  
You were coming from the wrong direction

Well they've been writing your name on a bathroom wall  
But it don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing  
They want to ruin your life, they wann see you take a fall  
But it don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing at all  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
  
You're mom and dad don't care about the way you feel  
And you just can't take it, you just can't take it  
You got the short end of a shitty deal  
Just can't take it, you just can't take it no more  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
  
They put a lot of effort into making you feel like a clown  
You gave it your best shot and they shot you down  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the fucking wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
Well it don't mean nothing at all  
It just don't mean nothing at all  
Well it don't mean nothing at all

There's trouble on the subway, there's something on the track  
There's a dead end waiting and we can't go back  
So take it to the highway, head back and open wide  
Step right up and take a nowhere ride  
  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere job and I'm fired  
It don't matter what they say  
You can't get there going this way  
From L.A. to Miami and all points in between  
Look outside you get the same old scene  
You take it to the highway  
You travel far and wide  
Caterpillars carving up the country side  
  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road  
No matter where it goes  
It's a nowhere road  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere job and I'm fired  
It don't matter what they say  
You can't get there going this way  
  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired  
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired

Rip out the trees and plant your flag  
Now I know just where you stand  
Nature means nothing to you  
Something that you can't control  
And we make ourselves miserable  
Trying to fill the hole  
  
It's sad that our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore  
  
How was I supposed to know  
I was steppin' on your toes  
The momentum builds to a fever pitch  
Talkin' but I just can't hear  
Watchin' our problems multiply  
Wishin' they would disappear  
  
It's sad that our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore, anymore  
And our love got lost in the translation  
And when I see you out  
You're a stranger to me now  
You're a stranger to me now  
  
I, I wish I could talk to you  
I wish I could make you see  
How much I care  
How much you mean to me  
  
That our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore, anymore  
And our love got lost in the translation  
And when I see you out  
You're a stranger to me now  
You're a stranger to me now

You oughtta see you  
You're always bitchin' about something  
People wanna be you  
But they don't know ya like I do now  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
Open your eyes, and see the good things that you've got now  
Don't you realize that life is always sweet and sour  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
I know you think there's a conspiracy to keep you down  
It's all in your head  
You gotta learn to tune it out  
It's true, it's true  
It's all up to you  
You oughtta see you  
You're always bitchin' about something  
No one's gonna free you  
From the prison that you're buildin'  
There's always something wrong in your perfect world  
Nobody's gonna solve your problems  
It all comes down to you  
I know you think there's a conspiracy to keep you down  
It's all in your head  
You gotta learn to shut it out  
It's true, it's true  
It's all up to you  
Yeah, it's all up to you  

One thing that I must have missed  
When I first met you  
Is that you only meant to love me  
Until you found someone new  
I guess I should have seen  
That you had one foot out the door  
Now I don't go down Rampart Street no more  
  
Back in the beginning  
You could look me in the eye  
Do you really think  
That I am just some stupid guy  
Cause now you tell your story  
As you stare down at the floor  
Cause I don't go down Rampart Street no more  
  
I don't wanna go back there  
You won't put your hooks in me  
I'm all alone tonight  
But I'll be alright  
  
You used to get excited  
Every time I'd come around  
You couldn't wait to sample  
What I'd brought you from downtown  
Up to your apartment  
I'd be knocking on your door  
I don't go down Rampart Street no more  
No I don't go down Rampart Street no more.

Ridin' round and round  
In my car I can't afford to go very far  
It needs a new transmission and new brakes  
  
Parking tickets  
I cannot pay  
They're gonna have to tow me away  
Tow me away  
'Cause I can't afford to drive  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
I've got a nasty rash on my rocker  
I can't afford to go see the doctor  
I know I'll be all right in a couple of weeks  
  
Happy hour,  
That's where we're meeting  
Eat for free as long as you're drinking  
Hey that ain't no problem  
For you and me  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
Yeah I'm all right It's all right

She, she belongs to me  
But she doesn't know it  
She comes walking down the street  
She don't notice me  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
I'm twisted metal tongue  
When I get around you  
I stutter incomplete  
I can't keep a beat  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
She comes round my door  
She gets me everytime  
She doesn't even notice me  
When she goes walking by  
  
She, she belongs to me  
But she doesn't know it  
She comes walking down the street  
She don't notice me  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb

I never told you the truth  
Holding your hand at the end of the rainbow  
Left you with nothing to lose  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
I used to be bulletproof  
I used to wear my hat like a halo  
There's too many holes in my roof  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
I used to be so aloof  
Whirling around like an angry tornado  
Faced with the burden of proof  
I can't lie anymore  
I can't lie anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
She sits alone in her room  
She won't let me in and I worry about her  
I hope that she's coming out soon  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine, the sunshine brings me down

She's blood, flesh and bone  
No tucks or silicone  
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound  
But somehow I can't believe  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothing's gonna happen, yeah.  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely.  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do, do, do, do do  
She's so high, high above me.  
  
A first class and fancy free,  
She's high society,  
She's got the best of everything.  
What could a guy like me ever really offer?  
She's perfect as she can be,  
Why should I even bother --- Aha  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do, do, do, do do  
She's so high, high above me  
  
She comes to speak to me,  
I freeze immediately,  
Cause what she says sounds so unreal,  
Somehow I can't believe,  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothing's gonna happen, yeah ah ah  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Oh yeah ah ah  
She's so high, high above me, oh yeah

Slow drag of a cigarette  
Slow drag and I'm lying in my bed  
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna lay you down in the ground alright  
Slow drag and I can't get up now  
Slow drag, you've been messing with my mind  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me

Oh yeah  
Huh

Sooner or later  
I'll find the key that lets me in  
Sooner or later  
Yeah, 'cause you just can't keep me down  
Yeah, 'cause you just can't keep me down  
I'm gonna take my time alright  
Sooner or later

No one knows the way  
(Which way the wind is gonna blow my mind)  
Another day has slipped away  
(And I have wasted so much time goes by)  
  
I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
  
You and I, we scream, we cry  
(We just can't seem to see things eye to eye)  
Who knows why we're here, we're gone  
(I get so lost I cannot see the sky)  
  
I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now you're fading out of view  
There's no me and there's no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio  
  
And I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now you're fading out of view  
There's no me and there's no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio

They made up their minds and they started packing  
They left before the sun came up that day  
An exit to eternal summer slacking  
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
They drank up the wine and they got to talking  
They now had more important things to say  
And when the car broke down they started walking  
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today  
The children woke up and they couldn't find 'em  
They left before the sun came up that day  
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em  
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

Yes I'm in love, who looks at you, the way, I do.  
When you smile, I can tell, we know each other,  
very well. How can, I show you, I'm glad, I got to  
know you. 'Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think  
I'm fine. Yes I'm in love, and what, I'd do, to make you  
mine. Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be, the last  
to know.  
  
[Chorus]  
My hands are shaking, don't let, my heart keep breaking,  
'cause I need your love, I want your love. Say your in love,  
in love, with this guy, if not I'll just die.  
  
Do Do Do Do Do Do  
Do Do Do Do  
  
Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be, the last  
to know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If not I'll just die.  
  
Do Do Do Do

This, this is not my life  
This, this is not my life  
  
This is not my face,  
This is not my place, no it's just isn't right  
  
This, this is not my life  
  
You, do you remember me?  
Remember, the way that it used to be.  
  
Do you remember our car,  
Do you remember our house,  
Do you remember what it was like  
Cause this, this is not my life  
  
[Chorus]  
My life, my life, (Now I live in the shadows)  
My life, my life, (Because you are my life)  
My life, my life,  
My life  
  
You're the only one, who can see, the real me  
You're the only one, can't you see, can't you see  
  
You took away my world  
You took away my world  
  
You took away my smile,  
You took away my life,  
You took away my reason to live  
  
You, you took away my world  
And this is not my life  
And this is not my life  
  
My life, my life, ('Cause now I live in the shadows)  
My life, my life, (Because you are my life)  
My life, my life, (And now it's endless night)  
My life, my life, (And this is not my life)  
My life, my life,  
My life, my life

Well I spent all my money at the record store  
Bought a copy of "Revolver" and some Gang of Four  
Singles Going Steady  
Billie Holliday  
They had it all on vinyl  
And I was blown away  
  
Then I walked around the corner to my favorite bar  
I do a lot more walkin' since I wrecked my car  
They all know my name here  
I feel right at home  
I just might spend the night here  
Since I know you're not alone  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
Well I wrote you a letter but I tore it up  
Then I wrote another letter and I tore it up  
Stare up at the ball game  
On the TV screen  
If you care to find me  
You'll know where I'll be  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
I'm down  
I'm down  
I'm down  
I'm down  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
And then they play that song I hate  
And I feel like I just can't win  
I'm breakin' down  
The room begins to spin  
I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right

I got a warm fuzzy feeling  
When I saw you on t.v.  
You were wearing a piece of me  
And it breaks my heart to look around  
And see the unimpressed  
Who can't believe the emperor is dressed  
  
Turn on my t.v.  
I want to check some action  
If you got no video  
Well then folks don't want to know  
But with you up there to light the way  
I can wear a smile as I survey  
The faces in the dark  
  
Waiting for you to hit one out of the park  
We notice every tiny little detail  
And every word we read we'll take to heart  
But we never really understand  
  
Until you realize  
There are no lies  
When you see that look in their eyes  
what are we gonna use to fill the empty spaces?  
  
When you see her in the crowd  
Will you make your mama proud?  
She can turn around and see the faces  
  
Looking at her son  
Climbing his way up to number one  
Scratching his way up to number one

Picked up the paper  
Flip through the pages  
Reach for my coffee cup  
Yes, I'm still waking up  
Late in the day now  
What can I say now?  
Some folks are morning people  
I never was one of those  
  
[Chorus]  
All the same  
I get in the game  
Give me muddy, muddy water  
Now I'm feeling better  
  
You know whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now  
  
Vodka and tonic, a touch of the chronic  
I'd trade my days for nights  
I love the city lights  
None of your business  
Who I might sleep with  
Some things are bad for me  
And some things I just can't resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know, whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now  
  
I'm feeling so free-wheeling  
But it's so hard to maintain  
Fascinate me, medicate me  
Cause I can't get over the pain  
  
Picked up the paper  
Flipped through the pages  
Coffee and cigarettes  
Turn on the TV set  
Night time is falling  
People are calling  
I love to watch them run  
Round and round and round  
  
You know, whatever gets you on  
And keeps you up right past the dawn  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling great now  
Let's do the town now

Where did you leave your baby  
bleeding in her bed?  
Her ghost has come to stay  
Oh, you can try, you can't chase her away  
In the bar we sit like blackbirds  
with our broken wings  
Like clocks without springs  
Just like time doesn't mean anything  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
Um, ah hey  
Um, ah hey  
We used to ride around  
in a broken down old car  
but now I'm changing trains  
Oh, and I'll hit all the notes in between  
Mom and Dad are fast asleep now  
but I'll be wide awake  
The surfer in the break  
Oh, just waiting for the perfect wave  
And a place in the shade  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
You better get it now  
while the getting's good  
ah, now, get it now  
while it's happening  
Oh!  
Get it nowwhile the getting's good  
Get it now, while it's happening  
Oh yeah  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  

Can you make it easier for me to understand,  
How you're holding my heart, in your trembling hands...  
Eyes that rise to meet me half way up among the stars,  
You may be from Venus but I'm definitely not from Mars  
  
[Chorus]  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time  
  
Make the warm winds circle round my head just like you do,  
If I could do it, I'd be doing it to you,  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time
