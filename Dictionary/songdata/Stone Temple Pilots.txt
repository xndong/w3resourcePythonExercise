Hey you, someone said you were lost out there  
In the grip, trying to strangle us all down here  
In the meantime, are you ever gonna set us free  
Hey you, will we ever get out of here?  
  
Are you ever gonna surrender  
Do you even care  
Wasn't talking about sweet submission  
It wasn't even there  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you're looking for something  
It's in the suit that you wear  
When you're hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
Hey you, you keep a-walking the razor  
On the edge, you cut your feet when you stand in there  
In the meantime, there's always someone to set you free  
Hey you, will you ever get out of there  
  
Are you ever gonna surrender,  
Do you even care?  
Wasn't talking about sweet submission  
It wasn't even there  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you're looking for something  
It's in the suit that you wear  
When you're hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you're looking for something  
It's in the suit that you wear  
When you're hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it

And so I know it's begun again  
Never be the same and with that I said  
Never ever be this way again (Campfire girls make me feel alright)  
Hold on till the end like it's the last hello  
Whirlwinds and rollercoasters  
Long grass making shapes hello  
Disappearing disappearing floating graves  
  
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way again  
Never ever be this way again  
  
And so I know It's begun again  
Never be the same again and with that I said  
  
Campfire girls, make me feel alright

She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me  
  
Visions of Mexico seduce me  
It goes to my head so carefully  
Memories of candles and incense  
And all of these things remember these  
  
She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me  
  
She comforts me when  
the candles blow out  
the cake has grown mold  
but the memories are sweet  
The laughter's all gone  
but the memories are mine  
The Mexican princess  
is out of my life  
  
She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me  

Lovely disguise, read between the lines  
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation  
Three, four you sell what you bought  
And there ain't no magic pen to get back what you lost  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Penguins don't fly  
Crocodile Sunday smile  
Really like to fish but don't like superficial people  
Shoe store heard it all before  
From pearly whites to pearly gates  
What do we have to argue 'bout  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Leave me all alone before  
(Get out the way)  
Never did what she was told  
(Get out the way)  
Seems to play at time of war  
(Get out the way)  
Less is big and listens more?  
  
Lovely disguise, read between the lines

So I'm letting it go again  
I'm halfway full on  
Left my meds on the sink today  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
So I'm holding her hand again  
My palm sweats  
Hold on  
Think I've had too much coffee  
I'm manic as hell  
But I'm goin' strong  
Left my meds on the sink again  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
Don't sleep behind the wheel at the stoplight  
Can't sleep behind the wheel as you're drivin' home  
  
You keep comin' down the hill as you're fallin'  
You keep fallin' from the hill as you're comin' down

Driving faster in my car  
Falling farther from just what we are  
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more  
These conversations kill  
Falling faster in my car  
  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Too much walking shoes worn thin  
Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin  
Time to catch her ride it leaves today,  
Her name is what it means  
Too much walking shoe worn thin  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill

When you're fed up and lonely  
And nothing else seems to matter really  
  
I'll be here waiting for the  
Black cloud to leave you  
I'll be here to hold your hand  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She can't eat  
She can't sleep  
She's not well (she's lonely again)  
She can't breathe  
She's in bed  
She's in hell  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
Hold your breath underwater  
And know you'll rise to the surface slowly  
  
Think of me as a ship that might hold you  
Carry you to the shore  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her

Black heart's comin', he?s a cold machine  
Cuts like a knife, gentle and clean  
Face like an angel, mind of a killer  
Nobody else gonna love her better  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Took her life with a quick pull trigger  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Well I don?t mind, I don?t mind  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Said I don?t mind if you don?t mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead man's eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Black heart's kickin' like a beating drum  
Shooting her down the sound of his gun  
No compassion, hard as an assassin  
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Deeper and deeper with a blind man's passion  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Well I don?t mind, I don?t mind  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Said I don?t mind if you don?t mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead mans eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Rescue me  
(If you don?t mind)  
[x3]  
  
If you don't mind  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead man's eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
  
I'll find a way to you someday  
I'll find a way to you someday  
  
And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
  
I'll find a way to you someday  
I'll find a way to you someday  
  
Father's always smokin'  
and your mom's at church on tuesday  
and your brother's always drinkin' and dyin'  
  
Father's always smokin'  
and your mom's at church on tuesday  
and your brother's always drinkin' and dyin'  
  
And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
And I don't believe it  
Is she really gone again?  
  
I'll find a way to you someday  
I'll find a way to you someday  
  
Father's always smokin'  
and your mom's at church on tuesday  
and your brother's always drinkin' and dyin'  

I'd like to sing a story for you  
Here's what I'd sing if I could impress you  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
You've got to be the prettiest girl  
I've ever witnessed in the whole world  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
We both talk about love  
We both know about love  
We both sing the songs  
Can you hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on  
  
I'd like to write a story for you  
With a little melody pretty for you  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Never condescend to humming, my dear  
Always speak the words so lovely to hear  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me?  
Hear me can you hear me now?  
  
We both talk about love  
We both know about love  
We both sing the songs  
Can you hear me can you hear me now?  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on  
  
Where did you come from  
Where are you now?  
Just like an angel  
Seems like you left me  
When you broke down  
Down  
Down  
Down  
  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on now  
Yeah, come on come on

Tar and feathers hide your feelings  
If you even know the meaning  
Your high road is overrated  
You left your guru out there hangin'  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
Your appetite's insatiable  
Devouring one thousand souls  
It's more or less the same ol' story  
The princess and the whore, the lady  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody sees it (nobody sees it)  
Nobody hears it (nobody hears it)  
Nobody breathin' in a coma  
So keep your secret (so keep your secret)  
Your perfect secrets (your little secrets)  
It's just a game, but no one's playin'  
  
In a coma lying, waiting  
Desire fills the lonely craving  
So many trampled-under footwear  
But more to fill the trophy cases  
  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay  
What they said was real makes me wanna steal  
Living under house guess I'm living I'm a mouse  
All's I gots is time got no meaning just a rhyme  
  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,  
I like to steal  
  
I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)  
  
Feeling uninspired think I'll start a fire  
Everybody run bobby's got a gun  
Think you're kinda neat then she tells me I'm a creep  
Friends don't mean a thing guess I'll leave it up to me.  
  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'guess I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,  
I like to steal  
  
I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)  
Angst

Hello, it's late  
You know I've tried to stop the rain  
Did you read about it?  
Did you think about it?  
Did you cry but nothing came?  
  
Hello it's late  
I know we tried to win the game  
Did you hear about it?  
Did you dream about it?  
I know you cried but nothing changed?  
Nothing matters again  
I didn't think it'd last that long  
But I'm just sittin' on this merry-go-round,  
And the music is too loud  
  
It's just a game  
That we used to play  
I didn't think we'd  
Take it all the way  
It kills me just because  
It can't be erased,  
We're married

Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
  
Strange, strange, strange, it's a dichotomy  
But it was never quite weird  
Or quite normal for me  
Take a break, take a breath and let's see where we're at  
Those damn bedbugs are sleeping up in my head  
All day, all night  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
  
Brave, brave, brave  
As the apostles go  
Is it a hickory hypothesis  
Or one man show?  
Take a rest  
Or take a ravel  
In the light of lights  
But them tall tale teasers  
Keep sneaking in my show tonight  
Alright  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on

Less conversation  
No moral obligation  
To tell me how you feeling tonight, (Right)  
Minds over racin'  
Visions got me shakin'  
Motor station changing your mind  
(Mind, mind, mind)  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap  
Lady Jabberwocky's eatin' bed bugs  
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China  
So where do we go?  
And where is the rabbit's hole?  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
I'm moving in  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away  
  
Ol' Tom Turtles  
A hustler and a cousin  
His lizard-like complexion ain't right  
Motor city's moving  
There's big business groovin'  
He's a number one per-center tonight  
  
(Right on  
Right on  
Right on  
Right on)  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap  
Lady Jabberwocky's eatin' bed bugs  
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China  
So where do we go?  
And where is the rabbit's hole?  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
  
Don't let the grip on this subside  
Chips will only grow one shoulder at a time  
The lessons of our lessons of our lives  
And forget about the troubles for a time, time, time, time  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
I'm moving in  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap

I Got You  
But it's the craving for the good life  
That sees me through troubled times  
When the mind begins to wander to the spoon  
  
And I got you  
Because your there to bend and nurture me through these  
Troubled times  
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind  
  
And I Got You to paint the sorrow on my day  
And I Got You to paint the roses on my grave  
And I Got You  
  
I Got You  
But it's the feeling that I get when your away  
Twist my mind 'cause I'm all alone and cold, gone I feel like dyin'  
And I Got You to fill the craving that I get inside my mind  
When you're there to fill the space I have inside, I feel like crying  
  
And I Got You to paint the sorrow on my day  
And I Got You to paint the roses on my grave  
And I Got You  
  
All the slippin' that I slap me  
I Got You, I Got You  
All the slippin' that I slap me  

Waitin' on a sunday afternoon for what I've read between the lines - Your lies  
Feelin' Like a hand in rusted shame. So do you laugh at those who cry - Reply?  
  
Leavin' On a southern train only yesterday you lied  
Promises of what I seemed to be only watched the time go by  
All of these things you said to me  
  
Breathing Is the hardest thing to do with all I've said and all that's dead
for  
You  
You lied - Goodbye  
  
Leavin' on a southern train only yesterday you lied  
Promises of what I seemed to be only watched the time go by  
All of these things I said to you

Somebody told me, I know where to go  
Somebody showed me, I was last to know  
  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
  
What I wanted, is what I wanted  
What I wanted is what she wanted  
  
Unfriendly feelings, down on wounded knee  
Unfriendly reasons, some blind mother's need  
  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
  
What I wanted, is what I wanted  
What I wanted is what she wanted  
  
You read the words and it sells you life  
They sell their words, but it's all a lie

Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom door  
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall  
She hides because she don't know nothin' don't know nothin' anymore  
She keeps a funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the door  
  
She doesn't know her name  
She doesn't know her face

She doesn't know her face  
  
Lady picture girl I think them boys don't like your show

Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom door  
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall  
She hides because she don't know nothin' don't know nothin' anymore  
She keeps a funny face it's locked and bagged it's just outside the door

Leave me out, get away  
I gotta go a long way home  
Can't see through the trees  
Leave me out, get away  
Better run fast as I can  
From the man, the dirty man, the old man  
  
In my song, run away, fly away  
Long way home  
Through the fields, the burning fields  
Call my name when you knock on the door  
Go insane  
When you knock on the door in my head  
And it's beatin' like a drum  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me  
Is it more of the same and  
Where can I find it?  
Tell me  
Is she fighting for air and  
Where does she come from?  
Tell  
  
Leave me out, get away  
I gotta go a long way home  
Can't see through the trees  
Leave me out, get away  
Better run fast as I can  
From the man, the dirty man  
Run away when he's knocking on the door  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
What's she runnin' from, I really don't know  
Keep her runnin', it's a long way home  
I hear the music, the songs we know  
It's out of time and the beat's too slow

It's ok, it's ok, ok relieve me  
Pins in me, pins in me, in me you kill me  
The lounge fly  
The lounge fly  
The fly you bring me  
I think I'm free but the dogs they  
Won't release me  
  
Don't have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me  
My bottle's empty but you always refuel me  
I feel I'm sinking but you wont let me drown me  
I wanna fuck I wanna fuck but do you need me?  
  
I can't give What I take away And the other understands  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man  
And I can't live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
(Repeat Above Once, Then Continue Down.)  
  
  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man (x3)  
  
I can't give What I take away And the other understands  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man  
And I can't live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
  
(Repeat Below until Song is Over)  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man

Fine place for a day full of breakdowns  
Takes more than a meltdown to show us how  
Throw a tack on the road stop the meat plow  
Got a bullet but it ain't mine  
  
They got these pictures of everything  
To break us down, yeah to break me down  
They make us hate and we make it bleed  
  
But I got a lover and yeah  
She shows me how,  
To understand it, yeah to understand  
I got a brother and well  
He shows me how,  
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it  
  
Take a break from the mousetrap we call home  
Takes more than a message to make me smile  
I can feel when she kisses me sleeping  
But not when the news is on

You're the fuel to the fire You're the weapons of war  
You're the irony of justice And the father of law  
  
I've been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?  
Angst...  
  
You're the champion of sorrow You're the love and the pain  
You're the fighter of evil Yet you're one and the same  
  
I've been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?  
Angst..  

I'm going under, I'm suffocating,  
Drowning, but I'm holding on  
What keeps me breathing?  
Don't have an answer,  
Drowning, but I won't let go  
  
Away now No way out  
  
I've been walkin', a lonesome highway  
I felt as though I had no home  
My bed's been taken, by another  
I made the bed, now lie alone  
  
Give it away now Motherfucker, now keep it away  
  
Away now No way out  
  
Give it away now  
  
Away now, No way out  
  
I'm going under, I'm suffocating,  
Drowning but I'm holding on  
What keeps me breathing?  
Don't have an answer,  
Drowning but I won't let go  
  
Give it away now  

Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed  
Suffering is critical in finding what you need  
Deliverance is evidence there's more than what you say  
Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams  
  
Oh, I know you can't tithe  
Oh, when you look inside yourself  
You've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time  
  
Loneliness is beautiful, it leads you home again  
Happiness is overrated, joy is infinite  
Liberate the hate you feel before it's permanent  
Smile when it hurts, it works like mother's medicine  
  
Oh, I know you can't tithe  
Oh, when you look inside yourself  
You've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time  
  
You've got to learn your lesson  
To see what you've been missing  
You've got to cross that line  
  
Yeah, you've got to look inside  
Yeah, it's time that you decide  
Yeah, you've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time

You love me more than those dirty clothes  
'Cause you can't imagine me as someone old  
But in the moment of sinless embrace  
Your eyes stare right through me to the back of my face  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
Talks of club connection was the way it began  
Not necessary dope but it was straight obsession  
Couldn't sleep it out but, oh hell, who needs sleep?  
Now you're six months later, it was, well, you know  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown

Broke the Breadline Nobody Knows  
I walked the frontline Still got far to go  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I broke the breadline Don't wanna know  
  
It's staring me down Wearing a crown of apathy  
I'm standing around Dressed like a clown  
Don't know my name You know where to find me  
  
I killed the manchild I'll fast alone  
I had the midwife Naked and alone  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I killed the brainchild I'll fast alone  
  
It's staring me down...  
  
Don't wanna let me be a man  
Don't wanna lead me to your home  
  
It's staring me down....  
  
I killed the manchild  
I had the midwife  
I drank the water  
I stand alone  
  
I broke the breadline  
I walked the frontline  
Don't know my name You know where to find me  
  
Don't wanna let me be a man  
Don't wanna lead me to your home  

And I feel that time's a wasted go  
So where ya going to tomorrow?  
And I see that these are lies to come  
Would you even care?  
And I feel it  
And I feel it  
Where ya going to tomorrow?  
Where ya going with that mask I found?  
And I feel, and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone?  
And I feel, so much depends on the weather  
So is it raining in your bedroom?  
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray  
Would you even care?  
And I feel it  
And she feels it  
Where ya going to tomorrow?  
Where ya going with that mask I found?  
And I feel, and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone?  
When the dogs do find her  
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow

Can you figure out what I want  
Pull the trigger with a pop gun  
Mindless fools that aggravate it  
Pick at you in desperation  
  
Oh it's a love pop suicide  
Oh I'm in love pop suicide  
Oh I really don't know  
  
Pop life living it is so real  
Midwest farmers' kids are milkfed  
Breed and incubate what you see  
Ten years later here on t.v.  
  
Oh it's a love pop suicide  
Oh I'm in love pop suicide  
Oh I really don't know  
  
Father can't you love your woman  
Father can't you teach your children  
Long range love implosion short wicked  
Short wave mind explosion  
  
Oh I'm in love suicide  
About a pop star homicide  

Have you seen your mother girl? Has she gone away?  
Gone away and found the pearl  
But the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
How far will you go I say, just to bait a mouse?  
Shorter lived and longer gone  
Can you figure out?  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
Have you lost your sister girl? She's all but blown away  
Blown away and lost the pearl  
And the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  

Falling farther with a flaming hand  
I knew the question but I lost the answers  
I'll hold the wall for all  
I'll hold it all for all  
As long as no one asks no questions.  
  
I got the message  
And the message stood  
  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another  
I got another hit that held me the last time  
Don't ya know what I mean boys?  
One, Two, three  
I got another, got another.  
  
Falling fast but doing all I can  
I know the questions but I lost the answers  
I got the message and the message stood  
  
Lease the one who makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
Kill the one that breaks it  
Always in the middle  
Keep the dream alive  
with sleeping pills you shouldn't fiddle  
Lease the one that makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
  
I got the message but I lost the race  
I got the message but I lost the race  

Regenerate the impoverished souls  
That echo you  
Bleed to feed the masses  
Soup line two times two  
  
They got your picture from the  
Sunday Plain Dealer that listed you  
(Dead)  
  
Forget the story. There's a bounty on  
Your head. They fingered you  
  
Right away. Right away  
Green light. Get a move on  
Right of way, right of way  
Stop sign, put the brakes on  
  
Positive cell regeneration  
Positive cell regeneration  
  
Celebrate the immortal youth  
That wasted you  
Peel the skin back from all the lies  
That blistered you  
  
They hold for ransom  
All the watered down truths  
That splintered your  
(Faith)  
So sell your soul, because you're already  
(Dead)  
They've listed you  
  
To the fields where lesser mice go  
To the fields where men follow  
To the fields where lesser mice go  
To the fields where we all follow

You say you want a revolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
You tell me that it's evolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
But when you talk about destruction  
Don't you know that you can count me out  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
Alright  
Alright  
  
You say you got a real solution  
Well, you know  
We'd all love to see the plan  
You ask me for a contribution  
Well, you know  
You know we're doing what we can  
But when you want money  
for people with minds that hate  
All I can tell is brother you have to wait  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
Alright  
Alright  
  
You say you'll change the constitution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change your head  
You tell me it's the institution  
Well, you know  
You better free you mind instead  
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao  
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
Alright  
Alright  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
Alright

She no wait but she know me  
Intake purge It's my disease  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
Just because You're so cliched  
It don't mean You won't get paid  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
She no wait but she know me  
Intake purge It's my disease  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
No way  

Sending out a message to the world  
But I just can't seem to find the words  
No one wants to die alone  
Broken and insane  
Question every last decision  
Another empty page  
  
Do you know the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
Wanting what I know won't satisfy  
Just to live this, need to live a lie  
Never meant to run away  
Jumping out the train  
My cage was built on good intentions  
Running every page  
  
Do you know the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
All the same on the inside  
All the same on the inside  
  
Do you want the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
All the same on the inside  
We're all the same on the inside  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
Yeah, we're all the same on the inside

Pass the time kickin' as time rips by  
Neither goose nor the gander fly  
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin' burnin'  
Take a peek as the model earns it earns it  
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin' crawlin'  
Clean the politician, wash with everpure  
  
So the answer gets harder  
A nd the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by  
  
Wastin' time chasing those cows that fly  
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost  
Track the blade as it swoops downward and onward  
Take a pill it'll kill martyrs, martyrs  
  
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by  
Pass the umbilical cord down for this flyby  
Take a sneak while the model earns it, earns it  
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin'  
  
So the answer gets harder  
And the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by  

Find you in the dark  
Read you like a cheap surprise  
Without shame  
Sell me out and frame your name  
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly  
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me  
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell  
You toed the line and I know it was mine  
Couldn't hide write a wave ride a lie  
Let me know can I friend ask you why?  
  
Rolling back the days  
With my friend I love to play  
The "little one"  
Superman with silver gun  
  
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly  
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me  
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell  
  
Wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life  
(leave me numb)  
Wait for me, tell a lie, try to take my life  
(leave me numb)  
Wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life  
(leave me numb)  
Close to me, and I'll leave you numb

Holy water clouds my thinking, sinking low now, keep on drinking  
Down you go, suffer long, Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
You control me, soul you stole, mine wishful thinking, six feet under  
Down you go, suffer long Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
So feel what were my eyes  
Sink into the holes in my eyes  
My sins have made me blind  
sink into the holes in my eyes  
  
Dead by dreaming, sleep you steal, mine Pools of cold sweat hatred burns me  
Down you go, suffer long, Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
Still shackled to the shadow  
Still shackled to the shadow That followed you...  

She turned away, what was she looking at?  
She was a sour girl the day that she met me  
Hey, what are you looking at?  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
  
What would you do?  
What would you do if I follow you?  
What would you do? I follow  
  
Don't turn away, what are you looking at?  
He was so happy on the day that he met her  
Say, what are you looking at?  
I was a superman, the looks are deceiving  
  
The rollercoaster ride's a lonely one  
I pay the ransom note to stop it from steaming  
Hey, what are you looking at?  
She was a teenage girl when she met me  
  
What would you do?  
What would you do if I follow you?  
What would you do? I follow  
  
What would you do?....  
  
The girl got reasons  
They all got reasons  
  
What would you do?....  
  
Hey, what are you looking at?  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
The day that she left me The day that she left me  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
The day that she left me The day that she left me  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  

Summer med fly ruled the airways  
Mostly superstitious

Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
  
Yeah, it's alright  
As we mosey on into the night  
Yeah, just set us free  
Could our shattered past just set us free?  
  
Give you all those diamonds  
Give you more and more  
Shattered all those lies I bought  
You from the record store  
  
Fleets of undergrounding artists  
Look for benediction  
Drive around waste gas and haul  
In every green addition

These endless days are wait for me  
Tearing my heart that breaks for you  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
  
Though you're not lying next to me  
I hear your song that calls to me  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day, a lonely day away  
  
The summer's gone and I can see  
The season's end is set me free  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day,  
A lonely day away  
  
Tomorrow I'm coming home  
Tomorrow I'm coming home  
I'm so tired and so alone  
  
It's like a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day,  
A lonely day away

Don't cut out my paper heart I ain't dyin' anyway  
Take a look at eye full towers Never trust them dirty liars  
Sippin' lemon yellow booze Ol' leadbelly sings the blues  
All dressed up on wedding day Keep on trippin' anyway  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
Fake the heat and scratch the itch Skinned up knees and salty lips  
I'll breathe your life vicks vapor life and when you binge I purge alike  
Let go it's harder holding on One more trip and I'll be gone  
  
So keep your head up Keep it on, just a whisper I'll be gone  
Take a breath and make it big It's the last you'll ever get  
Break you neck with diamond noose It's the last you'll ever choose  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
Hold me closer, closer let me go Let me be just let me be  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale

I can't cry  
I can't die  
I can't walk  
I can't talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I'm looking for a new meditation  
Still looking for a new way to fly  
Don't want any plastic validation  
Not looking for a new way to die  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I can't live  
I can't cry  
I can't die  
I can't walk  
I can't talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I'm lookin' for a new stimulation  
Quite bored of those inflatable ties  
I'm looking for a new rock sensation  
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
Can't live, can't buy new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Lived on a summer with new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Can't live, can't die - new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Lived on a summer with new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I can't live

Tumble in the rough  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  

Moderation Is masturbation  
What is what and what makes you feel good?  
All these things I think about I think about  
Always come unglued  
  
Yeah I got this thing its comin' over me  
I got this thing its comin' over me  
I got this feeling comin' over me  
Over me  
  
This confusion Is my illusion  
Nowhere to look but nowhere to find ya  
All these things I'm sick about I'm sick about  
Always come unglued  
  
Yeah I got this thing its comin' over me  
I got this thing its comin' over me  
I got this feeling comin' over me over me  
  
Moderation Is masturbation  
What is what and what makes you feel good  
All these things I think about I think about  
Always come unglued  
  
Yeah I got this thing its comin' over me...  

Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of a storm and never blow away  
Well I'm a young man with a knife to my back. Some things never seem to change  
  
Nowhere to run to, Nowhere to hide Sing the song or keep it inside  
Bought to farm, but the farmer done died. Sing that song, sing that song
inside  
  
I wish I could live in the dream that I fly on tarred and feathered wings  
Well, I'm losing a game of reality dice where the dealer never ever pays  
  
Nowhere to run to...  
  
I wanna be as big as a mountain, I wanna fly as high as the sun,  
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven I wanna know where the river goes  
  
Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of a storm and never blow away  
Well I'm a young man with a knife to my back Some things never seem to change  
  
Nowhere to run to...  
  
Ii wanna be as big as a mountain...  
  
If I was stronger I could be a mountain range  
If night was longer Could I escape the day?  

Can you see like a child?  
Can you see what I want?  
I wanna run through your wicked garden  
Heard that's the place to find ya  
Cause I'm alive So alive now  
I know the darkness blinds you  
  
Can you see without eyes?  
Can you speak without lies?  
I wanna drink from your naked fountain

I'm gonna burn Burn you to life now  
Out of the chains that bind you
