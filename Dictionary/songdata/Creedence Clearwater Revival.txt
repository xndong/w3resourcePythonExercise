Ev'ry day I'm gonna strut that stuff.  
When the music's loud I can't get enough.  
Singin' hi, singin' hi,  
Come on feet, teach yourself to move.  
  
People shuff'lin' up and down again.  
Unhappy faces ain't gonna get you in.  
Singin' hi, singin' hi,  
Come on people, teach yourself to move.  
  
Hey, hey! hey, all right!  
  
Spread the news, we're goin' have some fun.  
Let it go, movin' son-of-a-gun.  
Singin' hi, signin' hi,  
Come on feet, we was born to move.  
  
Hey, hey, lord! come on, move it, now boy!

Traffic in the city turns my head around.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
Backed up on the freeway, backed up in the church,  
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown.  
  
[Chorus]  
Com, commotion,  
Git, git, git, gone.  
Com, commotion,  
Git, git, git, gone.  
  
People keep atalkin', they don't say a word.  
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw.  
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door,  
So much goin' on I just can't hear.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurryin' to get there so you save some time.  
Run, run, run, run, run.  
Rushin' to the treadmill, rushin' to get home,  
Worry 'bout the time you save, save.  
  
[Chorus]

I went down to the station, just to take a ride.  
I went down to the station, just to take a ride.  
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind.  
  
Pullin' out from the platform, there was no brass band.  
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand.  
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train.  
Train, train, train, train.  
  
Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down.  
  
Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down.  
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run.  
Run, run, run, run.  
  
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.  
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.  
'Cause there's more miles between us than the Santa Fe line.  
Run, run, run, run.  
  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm....

Last night  
I saw a fire burning on  
The palace lawn.  
O'er the land  
The humble subjects watched in mixed  
Emotion.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who is burnin'?  
Who is burnin'?  
Effigy.  
Who is burnin'?  
Who is burnin'?  
Effigy.  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin' to  
  
The palace door.  
Silent majority  
Weren't keepin' quiet  
Anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin' to  
The country side.  
In the mornin'  
Few were left to watch  
The ashes die.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why?  
Why?  
Why?  
Effigy.

Hey, look over yonder out in the rain,  
Soakin' wet fever in my brain.  
Now, I ain't certain which way to go,  
But I got to move, sure.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder behind the wall,  
They're closin' in I'm about to fall.  
Now I'm no coward, but I ain't no cool  
Feel it in my bones, my book is due.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder, up in the tree,  
There's a rope hangin' just for me.  
It has a warnin', It has a warnin',  
Things are pilin' up to break me down.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder, out in the street,  
People laughin' by, walkin' easy.  
Now, I'm no sinner, but I ain't no saint.  
If it's happy, you can say I ain't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
I'm Feelin' Blue (x6)

Some folks are born, made to wave the flag  
Ooo, they're red, white and blue  
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"  
Ooo, they point the cannon at you, Lord  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no  
  
Some folks are born, silver spoon in hand  
Lord, don't they help themselves, y'all  
But when the taxman comes to the door  
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes  
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord  
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"  
Ooh, they only answer "More! More! More!", y'all  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one  
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one

Well, get down woman, before I have to go.  
Well, get down woman, before I have to go.  
You know, ya hurt me with your bad mouth,  
An' I just don't want to know.  
  
Well, slow down, baby, and gimme a little time.  
Well, slow down, baby, and gimme a little time.  
If you want me hangin' 'round,  
  
Gotta give me some peace of mind.  
  
Oh, get down boy.  
  
Well, get back, woman, before you bring it down.  
Well, now, get back, baby, before you bring it down.  
Or you can tell it to the wall,  
Without me hangin' around.

Some people laugh in the dark,  
Some people cry alone.  
Some people talk without sayin' a thing,  
And everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Some people count your money,  
Someone is countin' your days.  
And somebody got to keep track of your mind.  
  
When everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Brothers'll make you look sideways,  
Fathers'll make you look back.  
And when you're done talking, you still got to shoot,  
Cause everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Oh! oh!

Good golly miss molly, sure like to ball.  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.  
  
From the early early mornin' till the early early night  
You can see miss molly rockin' at the house of blue lights.  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.  
  
Well, now momma, poppa told me: "son, you better watch your step."  
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself.  
  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.  
  
I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring.  
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen carat golden thing.  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.  
  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball.  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.

On the highway, thirty people lost their lives.  
On the highway, thirty people lost their lives.  
Well, I had some words to holler, and my Rosie took a ride.  
  
In the moonlight, see the greyhound rollin' on.  
In the moonlight, see the greyhound rollin' on.  
Flyin' through the crossroads, rosie ran into the hound.  
  
For the graveyard, thirty boxes made of bone.  
For the graveyard, thirty boxes made of bone.  
  
Mister undertaker, take this coffin from my home.  
  
In the midnight, hear me cryin' out her name.  
In the midnight, hear me cryin' out her name.  
I'm standin' on the railroad, waitin' for the graveyard train.  
  
On the highway, thirty people turned to stone.  
On the highway, thirty people turned to stone.  
Oh, take me to the station, 'cause I'm number thirty-one.

Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yeh.  
Let me remember things I love.  
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,  
Walkin' along the river road at night,  
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight.  
  
I can hear the bull frog callin' me.  
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.  
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water,  
Shoe fly, dragon fly, get back t your mother.  
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River.  
  
Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh,  
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers.  
Old Cody, Junior took me over,  
Said, you're gonna find the world is smouldrin'  
And if you get lost come on home to Green River.

Hey, tonight,  
Gonna be tonight,  
Don't you know I'm flyin'  
Tonight, tonight.  
  
Hey, c'mon,  
Gonna chase tomorrow

Tonight, tonight.

I put a spell on you, because you're mine  
You better stop the thing that you're doin'  
I said, "Watch out, I ain't lyin'", yeah  
I ain't gonna take none of your, foolin' around  
I ain't gonna take none of your, puttin' me down  
I put a spell on you because you're mine, all right  
  
I put a spell on you, because you're mine  
You better stop, the thing that you're doin'  
I said, "Watch out, I ain't lyin'", yeah  
I ain't gonna take none of your, foolin' around  
I ain't gonna take none of your, puttin' me down  
I put a spell on you because you're mine, all right and I took it down

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline.  
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen.  
Laid on the ground and shook, fearin' for his life.  
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' "it came out of the sky."  
  
Well, a crowd gathered 'round and a scientist said it was marsh gas.  
Spiro came and made a speech about raising the mars tax.  
The Vatican said, "Woe, the lord has come".  
Hollywood rushed out an epic film.  
And Ronnie the popular said it was a communist plot.  
  
Oh, the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero.  
  
Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network t.v. show.  
The white house said, "put the thing in the blue room".  
The Vatican said, "No, it belongs to Rome."  
And Jody said, "It's mine and you can have it for seventeen million."  
  
Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline.  
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen.  
Laid on the ground a shakin', fearin' for his life.  
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' "it came out of the sky."  
Oh!

Jeremiah was a bullfrog, he was good friend of mine  
I never understood a single word he said  
But I helped him drink his wine  
He always had some mighty fine wine, sing it  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls now  
Joy to the fishiest in the deep blue sea  
And joy to you and me  
  
And if I were the king of the world  
I tell you what I would do  
I'd throw away the cars and the bars in the world  
And I'd make sweet love to you, sing it now  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls now  
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Yah know I love the ladies, love to have my fun  
I'm a hard knock flier and a rain bow rider  
A straight shootin' son of a gun  
I said a straight shootin' son of a gun  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls  
Joy to all the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls  
Joy to all the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world, all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me

Just about a year ago  
I set out on the road  
Seekin' my fame and fortune  
Lookin' for a pot of gold  
Thing got bad and things got worse  
I guess you know the tune  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
Rode in on the Greyhound  
I'll be walkin' out if I go  
I was just passin' through  
Must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money  
Looks like they took my friends  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
  
A man from the magazine  
Said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connections  
Ran out of songs to play  
I came into town, a one night stand  
Looks like my plans fell through  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar  
For every song I've sung  
Every time I had to play  
While people sat there drunk  
You know, I'd catch the next train  
Back to where I live  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move.  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Pack my bag and let's get moving  
'Cause I'm bound to drift awhile.  
Though I'm gone, gone  
You don't have to worry  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Guess I've got that old travelin' bone  
'Cause this feeling won't leave alone.  
But I won't, won't  
Be losin' my way  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light.

[Chorus]  
I'm lookin' for a reason to stay.  
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today.  
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go.  
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way.  
  
Ev'ry night I ask myself again  
Just what it was that made our dream begin.  
It seemed like a good idea way back then.  
But I'm wond'rin' now what daydream took me in.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday I tried once more to find  
A way to share the trouble on my mind.  
It seems like you turn away ev'ry time.  
I used to like it here, I can't remember why.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Yes, my baby left me, never said a word.  
Was it something I done, something that she heard?  
You know she left me, my baby left me.  
My baby even left me, never said a word.  
  
But, I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry.  
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye.  
You know she left me, I say, she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.  
Help me, boy!  
  
And now, one of these mornings, lord, it won't be long,  
  
You'll look for me and, baby, daddy he'll be gone.  
You know she left me, I say she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said a word.  
  
Now, I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan.  
All I know is that the one I love is gone.  
My baby left me, I say she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.

I got to have all your love, night and day.  
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.  
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.  
  
Don' t be led in the wrong direction.  
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection,  
Yes he do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right.  
Lookie here,  
  
We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right.  
  
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight,  
Yes we do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right, sugar.  
Got to have a hundred,  
Got to have a hundred.  
All right.  
Ooh, I must do, I must do,  
I must do now.  
  
Oh! got to have a hundred!  
Got to have a hundred!  
Oh! got to have a hundred, too right.  
Got to have a hundred, now. oh!

It's been an awful long time since I been home,  
But you won't catch me goin' back down there alone.  
Things they said when I was young are quite enough to get me hung.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
They came and took my dad away to serve some time,  
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind.  
Folks said I was full of sin, because I was the next of kin.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Folks were out one night to put me up a fence,  
And you can guess that I've been runnin' ever since.  
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help, and I'll keep on, I tell myself.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help,  
And I'll keep on, I tell myself.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!

Whoa thought it was a nightmare  
Lord it was so true  
  
They told me don't go walking slow  
The devil's on the loose  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Thought I heard a rumblin'  
Calling to my name  
  
Two hundred million guns are loaded  
Satan cries "take aim"  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke  
Let the people know my wisdom  
Fill the land with smoke  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see

First thing I remember was asking papa, why,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,  
Saying, someday you'll understand.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,  
And someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,  
Sayin' someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.  
  
Think it was September, the year I went away,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And I still see him standing, tryin' to be a man,  
I said, someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.

Oh Suzie Q, Oh Suzie Q  
Oh Suzie Q, I love you,  
Suzie Q  
  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
Suzie Q  
  
Say that you'll be true  
Say that you'll be true  
Say that you'll be true  
And never leave me blue  
Suzie Q  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
Baby all the time  
Suzie Q  
  
Oh Suzie Q, Oh Suzie Q  
Oh Suzie Q, I love you,  
My Suzie Q  
  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
My Suzie Q  
  
Oh Suzie Q, Oh Suzie Q  
Oh Suzie Q  
Baby, I love you, my Suzie Q

Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the Southland  
I miss Alabamy once again  
And I think it's a sin, yes  
Well I heard mister Young sing about her  
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the governor  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how about you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Oh sweet home baby  
Where the skies are so blue  
And the governor's true  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lordy  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer

If maybe you'd move over,  
Gave someone else a chance to try their luck,  
Instead, you run up closer,  
Try'n to grab a page before they close the book.  
  
[Chorus]  
It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began  
Hope you take it like a friend.  
It's a shame to see you cryin' , wouldn't think to way back when,  
Looks like i'll never hear the end.  
  
Thought you had the honor,  
Took special pride in all your well laid plans.  
  
Forgot about the others,  
We moved out t'ward the light showin' empty hands.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah, put the boot down! mm-hm!  
  
Love to be the winner.  
Gather up your chips in time to cash 'em in.  
We're all lookin' thinner,  
Playin' cards too close for either one to win.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when,  
Hope you take it like a friend.  
Yeah

Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Ev'ry time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
Saw the gypsy man, 'way down in san berdoo.  
Said, I saw the gypsy man, 'way down in san berdoo.  
Five dollars on the table, ooh,  
Keep me 'way from my tomb.  
Oh! oh!  
  
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck,  
Bound to be some pain.  
Don't you do no trav'lin',  
Fly in no machines.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
  
Every time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
The man gave me a luck charm, cost five dollars more,  
Said, "put some on your pillow, and put some on your door."  
He said, "take a long vacation, ooh,  
For thirteen months or more."  
Oh, lord!  
  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Every time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
Oh, oh, lord!  
Oh, lord!

Seven thirty seven comin' out of the sky  
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride  
I want to move  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
Yeah!  
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land tryin' to get a hand  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
  
Take me to the hotel baggage gone oh well  
Come on come on won't you get me to my room  
I want to move  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
Yeah!  
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
  
Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show  
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia  
Want to move  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
Yeah!  
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
  
Here we come again on a Saturday night  
With your fussin' and your fightin' won't you get me to the rhyme  
I want to move  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
Yeah!  
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand  
Playin' in a travelin' band  
  
Won't you give myself a hand?

There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'  
Just as fast as my feet can fly  
Come away, come away if you're goin',  
Leave the sinkin' ship behind.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on the risin' wind,  
We're goin' up around the bend.  
  
Ooh!  
  
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo,  
Better get while the gettin's good,  
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway  
Where the neons turn to wood.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh!  
  
You can ponder perpetual motion,  
Fix your mind on a crystal day,  
Always time for a good conversation,  
There's an ear for what you say.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah!  
  
Ooh!  
  
Catch a ride to the end of the highway  
And we'll meet by the big red tree,  
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'  
Come along, come along with me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah!

Long as I remember the rain been comin' down  
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground.  
Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm  
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.  
The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm.  
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears  
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

Met myself a comin' county welfare line.  
I was feelin' strung out, hung out on the line.  
Saw myself a goin', down to war in June.  
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wrote a song for everyone,  
Wrote a song for truth.  
Wrote a song For everyone  
And I couldn't even talk to you.  
  
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.  
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed.  
If you see the answer, now's the time to say.  
All I want, all I want is to get you down and pray.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Saw the people standin' thousand years in chains.  
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same.  
Pharoah's spin the message, 'round and 'round the truth.  
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?  
  
[Chorus: x2]
