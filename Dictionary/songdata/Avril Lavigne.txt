[Verse:]  
Countin' down, it's new years eve,  
You come on over, then start, askin' me,  
'Hey girl, you wanna dance? '  
I try to say no, but it came out yes and,  
Here it goes, middle of the dance floor,  
We're both, pretty nervous, I can tell by look in his eyes,  
Then came the count down,  
  
[Chorus:]  
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!  
New years!  
Everybody shouts, and here it goes,  
I wanna see it flow,  
We, look at the screen,  
The camera was focused on us,  
You blushed and turned away,  
I kissed you on the cheek and ran away,  
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
My birthday, everybody's here,  
All except for one,  
At the sleepover, you showed right then,  
All the girls scream, except for me,  
You have, roses in your hand,  
Gave em to me and whispered,  
Payin' you back,  
Then, all the girls  
Started to get that feeling...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Then they shouted  
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!  
Here it goes,  
Then he kissed me on the cheek and said,  
Just remember this day, Later on in your life,  
You'll recall this day, and wonder why,  
I didn't count down,  
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!  
Then I got that feeling when you left,  
It was the count down,  
I got that feeling  
It was a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!  
Once again

Adia I do believe I failed you  
Adia I know I let you down  
Don't you know I tried so hard  
To love you in my way  
It's easy let it go...  
Adia I'm empty since you left me  
Trying to find a way to carry on  
I search myself and everyone  
To see where we went wrong  
'cause there's no one left to finger  
There's no one here to blame  
There's no one left to talk to, honey  
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence  
'cause we are born innocent  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter  
Does it matter?  
Adia I thought that we could make it  
But I know I can't change the way you feel  
I leave you with your misery  
A friend who won't betray  
I pull you from your tower  
I take away your pain  
And show you all the beauty you possess  
If you'd only let yourself believe that  
We are born innocent  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter, does it matter?  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
'cause we are born innocent  
Adia we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter... But does it matter?

Trippin' out  
Spinnin' around  
I'm underground, I fell down  
Yeah, I fell down  
  
I'm freakin' out  
So where am I now?  
Upside down  
And I can't stop it now  
It can't stop me now  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me?  
I, I won't cry  
  
I found myself in Wonderland  
Get back on my feet again  
Is this real?  
Is this pretend?  
I'll take a stand until the end  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me?  
I, I won't cry  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me  
I, I won't cry

Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Hey man  
Tell me what were you thinking?  
What the hell were you saying?  
Oh, come on now, stop and think about it  
Hey now  
Maybe you should just listen  
Maybe you should stop talking for a second  
Shut up, listen to me  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Hey bro  
I'm just tryin' to let you know  
You really think that you're special  
Oh, come on now, I've seen so much better  
Hey there  
Did you actually think that I cared?  
Don't know if you want to go there  
Oh, come on now, keep on, keep on dreamin?  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
If you want to be my, uh, uh, oh  
You know you can't play games  
And you know what I mean  
Sorry, but you don't get my, my-why-why-why  
I'm gone, you're still dreaming  
About me over and over and over and over again  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Alone  

Don't want to be an American Idiot,  
Don't want a nation under the new media,  
Can you hear the sound of hysteria?  
The subliminal mind fuck America  
  
Welcome to a new kind of tension,  
All across the alienation,  
Where everything isn't meant to be ok,  
Television dreams of tomorrow,  
We're not the ones meant to follow,  
For that's enough to argue,  
  
Well Maybe I am the faggot America,  
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda,  
Now everybody do the propaganda!  
And sing along to the age of paranoia  
  
Don't want to be an American Idiot,  
One nation controlled by the media,  
Information age of hysteria  
Is Calling out to idiot America

Time to burn it all away, time to think of what to say  
Time to go right back to yesterday.  
Time for movements in the past, time for something that won't last.  
Not just fire quick and die off fast.  
Things are never what they seem,  
I'm stuck inside of someone else's dream.  
Problems never go away...  
I'm sick of being caught in yesterday.  
Every day it's still the same, different faces, different names,  
But still stuck here playing these stupid games.  
Maybe soon I'll figure out what giving up is all about  
My heart is filled so full of doubt.  
Don't turn around, don't look ahead  
I won't listen to all the lies I'm fed.  
Don't have to listen to you  
So don't you fucking tell me what to do.

[Chorus:]  
Another day, another night,  
Is this going to be alright?  
I'm really wondering  
If this is reality or just another day,  
Another night,  
That I'm without you,  
I'm spending another day,  
I'm not thirsty but the rain keeps falling down,  
On you and me like a blessing from above,  
And when you look into my eyes,  
Its like nobody else is there,  
  
[Verse:]  
Just coming on through a terrible day,  
You weren't there to say the things you usually say,  
So I guess I've been doing fine,  
But not really because I'm lost without you,  
Never to say, you're usually here with me but not today,  
There was no one to talk to or to turn to when I was feeling down,  
Just looking back on the pages of my life,  
Turning through the good and the bad times,  
But that's when I had you, to say,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Another day another night  
Is it going to be alright?  
I worried that so long ago,  
But now I have you,  
To look back on our lives,  
I'm just saying this because that's when I didn't have you,  
Like the good or the bad times,  
Another day another night,  
Is it going to be okay?  
At least till the next day,  
When I realize,  
It was another day, another night,  
It was going to be alright,  
Just the thought of you going away,  
It would be another day,  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I came through, I cried my heart out,  
And should of been saying to you,  
This is another day,  
I guess it was okay,  
Just it's a another gig

Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (3x)  
  
We had the best years of our lives,  
But you and I would never be the same,  
September took me by surprise,  
And I was left to watch the seasons change.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (3x)  
  
It's been so quiet since you're gone,  
And everyday feels more like a year,  
Sometimes I wish I could move on,  
The memories would all just disappear.  
  
So many things I should've,  
Said when I had the chance,  
So many times we took it all for granted.  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'd never thought this could ever end,  
I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,  
Everything is different now,  
Can we stop the world from turning?  
  
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,  
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,  
I Wish I could go back,  
And we'd stop the world from turning.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (2x)  
  
Looking back on better days,  
When we were young, we thought we knew so much.  
And now it seems so far away,  
I'm wondering If I was good enough.  
  
So many things I should've,  
Said when I had the chance,  
So many times we took it all for granted.  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'd never thought we would ever end,  
I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,  
Everything is different now,  
Can we stop the world from turning?  
  
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,  
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,  
I Wish I could go back,  
And we'd stop the world from turning.  
  
Gone are all the days,  
When we swore we'd never break,  
And now I'm left here alone.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (3x)  
Oh oh ooo...  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...  
I'd never thought this would ever end,  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...  
I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...  
Everything is different now,  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...  
Can we stop the world from turning?  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'd never thought this could ever end,  
I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,  
Everything is different now,  
Can we stop the world from turning?  
  
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,  
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,  
I Wish I could go back,  
And we'd stop the world from turning.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (2x)  
Oh oh oo ooo.

Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Everyone is waitin' on the bell  
Couple seconds, we'll be raisin' hell.  
The sun is shinin' down, school is finally out.  
Nothin' matters, so we might as well.  
  
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,  
Come and party, do it while we're young.  
Move your body, when you hear the drum.  
So put your hands up!  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be, be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Throwin' empty bottles in the fire  
Whiskey's got us singin' like a choir  
We're all gonna run, when the police come.  
But in the mornin' we're so alive.  
  
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,  
Come and party, do it while we're young.  
Move your body, when you hear the drum.  
So put your hands up!  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Right-right-right near the beach  
Te party don't stop  
If we don't get harassed by the motherfuckin' cops  
Quarter tank of gas  
About a half a pack  
My cell phone's dyin' but there's no turnin' back  
I can feel the breeze  
Steerin' with my knee  
Drummin' on the dashboard  
Bumpin' to the beat  
Hit the windshield wiper  
Searchin' for my lighter  
I gotta get right before this all nighter  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.

Grew up in a small town,  
And when the rain would fall down,  
I'd just stare out my window.  
  
Dreaming of what could be,  
And if I'd end up happy.  
I would pray.  
  
Trying not to reach out  
But when I try to speakout  
Felt like no one could hear me  
  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Wanna feel the warm breeze.  
Sleep under a palm tree.  
Feel the rush of the ocean.  
Get onboard a fast train.  
Travel on a jetplane.  
Far away,  
And break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors.  
Swinging with revolving doors.  
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me.  
Gotta keep movin on movin on.  
Fly away,  
Break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye,  
Take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget the place I come from,  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
I should Breakaway.  
Break away.

Addicted to razors  
Lashes to saviors  
Glued to the monitor  
Trained behavior  
Reduced to a number  
Mechanic enslavement  
A virtual prison  
Selected detainment  
A gradual nightmare  
Suicidal impulse  
A cycle of habit  
Undeniable loss  
Breathing by wire  
A network of heroes  
Processing data of ones and zeroes  
Carry me through the wires  
Bury me in the screen  
Shift me into this fixation  
Cling to the machine  
This I your world now  
And you barely made it  
Did you think that I would cradle you  
Until you were asleep forever?  
Did you?  
Carry me through the wires  
Bury me in the screen  
Shift me into this fixation  
Cling to the machine  
This is your world  
And you barely made it  
Did you think I could cradle you  
Until you were asleep forever?  
Did you?

I'm broken, but no one knows  
I'm just a poser, but I've brainwashed the world  
No one will ever know how much of a poser I really am  
  
'Cause I'm punk! I really am, watch me strum my guitar  
I'm punk hear me roar! I'm gonna break my guitar  
Now watch me as I sing my song  
  
I sit hear singing my wannabe punk songs  
They are really popish songs but soon they will be punk  
'Cause I'm cool like that  
'Cause I'm such a punk rawker!  
  
'Cause I'm sew punk! I really am watch me strum my guitar  
I'm punk hear me roar I'm gonna break my guitar  
Now watch me as I sing my song  
  
I used to be a country singer  
A cheerleader popular gurl  
I never really liked all this punk rawk stuff  
But I wanted to break free and be cool and start trends  
  
But it's all good, 'cause I'm just so punkie!

I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
  
Out on the bridge  
I thought I saw you  
Somewhere between now and never  
So do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
  
Take me home  
'Cause there's no other place  
I'd rather be.  
Take me back home.  
Cause there's no other place  
Take me back to where all my secrets end  
The way you were catching snakes in the sand.  
  
I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.

Wake up, (Wake up)  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup,  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?  
Here you go create another fable  
  
You wanted to,  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup,  
You wanted to,  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup,  
You wanted to,  
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table,  
You wanted to,  
  
I don't think you trust,  
In, my, self righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die! Rrrrrrraaa!  
  
Wake up, (Wake up)

In, my, self-righteous suicide, I, cry  
When angels deserve to die.  
  
Father, Father, Father, Father,  
Fall into your hands, I commend my spirit,  
Fall into your hands,  
Why have you forsaken me,  
In your eyes forsaken me,  
In your thoughts forsaken me,  
In your heart forsaken, me oh,  
  
Trust in my self-righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die,  
In my self righteous suicide,  
I, cry, when angels deserve to die.

It's alright to tell me  
What you think about me  
I won't try to argue  
Or hold it against you  
I know that you're leaving  
You must have your reasons  
The season is calling  
And your pictures are falling down  
  
The steps that I retrace  
The sad look on your face  
The timing and structure  
Did you hear she fucked him?  
A day late a buck short  
I'm writing the report  
On losing and failing  
When I move I'm flailing now  
  
And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybody's gone  
And I've been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
And maybe I'll see you  
At a movie sneak preview  
You'll show up and walk there  
On the arm of that girl  
And I'll smile and you'll wave  
We'll pretend it's okay  
The charade it won't last  
When she's gone I won't come back  
  
And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybody's gone  
And I've been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]  
Well, I guess this is growing up

I'm Standing on a bridge  
I'm waiting in the dark  
I thought that you'd be here by now  
There's nothing but the rain  
No footsteps on the ground  
I'm listening but there's no sound  
  
Isn't anyone trying to find me?  
Won't somebody come take me home  
It's a damn cold night  
Trying to figure out this life  
Wont you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I... I'm with you  
You  
Now I see keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
I hit you and you hit me back  
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still  
Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real  
Now I'm trapped in this memory  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
So even though you're close to me  
You're still so distant  
And I can't bring you back  
It's true the way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
I'm with you  
It's all I can do  
  
The city's flooding  
And our love turns to rust  
We're beaten and blown by the wind  
Trampled in dust  
I'll show you a place  
High on a desert plain  
Where the streets have no name

Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again  
Start smilin'  
I know you're tryin', real hard not to turn your head away  
Pretty darlin'  
Face tomorrow, tomorrow's not yesterday  
Yesterday, oh, oh  
  
Pretty please, I know it's a drag  
Wipe your eyes and put up your head  
I wish you could be happy instead  
There's nothing else I can do  
Then love you the best that I can  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
  
Darlin', I was there once a while I go  
I know, that it's hard to be stuck with people  
That you love when nobody trusts  
  
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (I know it's a drag)  
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (put up your head)  
I wish you could be happy instead  
There's nothing else I can do  
Then love you the best that I can  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
That I can  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
You're not the only one who's been through  
I've been there alone and now so are you  
I just want you to know,  
Want you to know it's not your fault  
It's not your fault  
  
Oh, oh, you're fault, you're fault  
It's not your fault  
You're fault, you're fault, you're fault  
  
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (know it's a drag)  
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (put up your head)  
I wish you could be happy instead  
There's nothing else I can do  
Then love you the best that I can  
  
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (know it's a drag)  
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (put up your head)  
I wish you could be happy instead  
There's nothing else I can do  
Then love you the best that I can  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lalala-a (lalala-a)  
Yea  
Lalala-a (lalala-a)  
  
I coulda been the one you noticed  
I coulda been all over you  
I coulda been like all the others  
Is that what I'm supposed to do?  
  
It woulda been really stupid,  
If I woulda went home with you  
To give you everything you wanted  
It woulda been way too soon  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away...  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... Lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream  
  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doing it again  
  
If I tell you what I'm thinking,  
If I let myself trust you  
Can you give me what I'm missing  
Can you make my dreams come true  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away,  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... Lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain how I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream, yeah  
  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,

And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doin' it again

(Michelle)  
The building turned it's back ignored my call,  
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall,  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene,  
I counted people as I neared the street below,  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below  
Whoa-oa-oa  
  
(Avril)  
I saw it all I saw it all go down,  
The shadow grew as he approached the ground,  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene,  
They turned away as he came near the street below,  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below  
  
  
(Michelle)  
Lets forget this all move on

Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own  
Why do you have to leave, me  
It seems, I'm losing something deep inside of me  
Hold on, onto me  
  
Now I see  
Now I see  
  
Everybody hurts some days  
It's okay to be afraid  
Everybody hurts  
Everybody screams  
Everybody feels this way  
And it's okay  
La di da di da  
It's okay  
  
It feels like nothing really matters anymore  
When you're gone  
I can't breathe  
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way  
This can't be happening  
  
Now I see (now I see)  
Now I see  
  
Everybody hurts some days  
It's okay to be afraid  
Everybody hurts  
Everybody screams  
Everybody feels this way  
And it's okay  
La di da di da  
It's okay  
La la la la la  
  
So many questions so much on my mind  
So many answers I can't find  
I wish I could turn back the time  
I want to  
  
Everybody hurts some days (some days)  
Everybody hurts some days (some days)  
Everybody hurts some days (some days)  
Its okay to be afraid (afraid)

Try to tell me what I shouldn't do  
You should know by now, I won't listen to you  
Walk around with my hands up in the air  
'Cause I don't care  
  
'Cause I'm alright I'm fine  
  
Just freak out let it go  
  
I'm gonna live my life  
I can't ever run and hide, I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know  
I'm gonna close my eyes  
I can't watch the time go by  
I won't keep it inside  
Freak out let it go  
Just freak out let it go  
  
Do you always have to do everything right  
Stand up for yourself  
And put up a fight  
Walk around with your hands up in the air  
Like you don't care  
  
'Cause I'm alright I'm fine  
  
Just freak out let it go  
I'm gonna live my life  
I can't ever run and hide I won't compromise cause I'll never know  
I'm gonna close my eyes  
I can't watch the time go by

Freak out let it go  
  
On my own  
Let it go  
Yeah yeah yeah

I can't watch the time go by  
  
I won't keep it inside  
Freak out let it go  
Just freak out let it go  
Gonna freak out let it go

When I first saw you  
I never thought I would love you  
At all, or at least as I do now  
I don't know when it happened or how  
  
When we were best friends, all we did was hang out, laugh, and joke  
Never did I stutter, or choke  
Until just this year, I don't know why  
I became extremely shy  
I look at you and look away  
For I don't know what to say  
  
Now it's the last day of school  
Everyone thinks this day is so cool  
But not for me  
For it is today, that I see  
How dumb I'm being, acting  
While I'm hiding, last year we'd be talking  
The last day, last year,  
You said goodbye, and now we're here  
  
Will it ever be the same?  
Will we ever just sit and talk, it used to be that way  
Now I'm not sure it can come to be  
For I am no longer the old me  
  
I am shy, I am weak  
Seemed to have broken my good-girl streak  
The thing that keeps me going everyday  
Is that you look past all that and see me, the old way  
You see me, and I see you, what's the problem, then?  
I don't know, but I want to be the best friends we used to be

Slipping down a slide  
I did enjoy the ride  
Don't know what to decide  
You lied to me  
You looked me in the eye  
It took me by surprise  
Now are you gratified  
You cried to me  
  
La, la, la, la, la  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
  
When I was feeling down  
You'd start to hang around  
And then I found your hands all over me  
And that was out of bounds  
You filthy rotten hound  
It's better than it sounds, believe me  
  
La, la, la, la, la  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
  
Hey, you gotta get over it  
Hey, you gotta get over it  
  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
  
You'll have to get over it

[Chorus]  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
I think you need a new one  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I want to be your girlfriend  
  
You're so fine  
I want you mine  
You're so delicious  
I think about you all the time  
You're so addictive  
Don't you know what I can do  
To make you feel all right?  
  
Don't pretend  
I think you know  
I'm damn precious  
And, hell yeah  
I'm the motherfuckin' princess  
I can tell you like me too  
And you know I'm right  
  
She's like so, whatever  
You could do so much better  
I think we should get together now  
(And that's what everyone's talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can see the way  
I see the way you look at me  
And even when you look away  
I know you think of me  
I know you talk about me all the time  
Again and again  
  
So come over here  
And tell me what I wanna hear  
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear  
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again and again)  
  
Cause she's like so, whatever  
You could do so much better  
I think we should get together now  
(And that's what everyone's talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge x 2]  
(Oh)  
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger  
Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better  
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?  
She's so stupid  
What the hell were you thinkin'?  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
  
I think you need a new one  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
  
I want to be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
I think you need a new one  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I want to be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey!

Everytime you go away  
It actually kinda makes my day  
Everytime you leave  
You slam the door  
  
You pick your words so carefully  
You hate to think you're hurting me  
You leave me laughing on the floor  
  
'Cause I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know, I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
I thought we were just hanging out  
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?  
You thought the way you taste would get me high  
You went to all your friends to brag  
Guys are always such a drag  
Don't ya know the reason that  
I kissed you was to say goodbye  
  
Cause I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
Hangin', Hangin' out

Please wrap your drunken arms around me  
And I'll let you call me yours tonight  
Cause slightly broken's just what I need  
And if you give me what I want  
Then I'll give you what you like  
  
Please tell me I'm your one and only  
Or lie and say at least tonight  
I've got a brand new cure for lonely  
And if you give me what I want  
Then I'll give you what you like  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like  
  
Emotions aren't that hard to borrow  
When love is a word you've never learned  
And in a room of empty bottles  
If you don't give me what I want  
Then you'll get what you deserve  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
  
I've got this scene in my head  
I'm not sure how it ends  
Is it love?  
Maybe one day  
  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like  
  
I'll give you one last chance to hold me  
If you give me one last cigarette  
By now it's early in the morning  
Now that I gave you what you want  
All I want is to forget  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
  
I've got this scene in my head  
I'm not sure how it ends  
Is it love?  
Maybe one day  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like

[Chorus:]  
I want you to go away,  
I hate you now and I shall forever,  
Go, go, I hate you,  
Why you gotta step up, step up,  
And tell me I'm wrong to hate you,  
Ya know what boy?  
My thoughts are never gonna change bout you,  
So why you still going for me?  
Haven't you noticed yet,  
There's a thing I said, 'go',  
And ya know, 'cause it's goes, and so will you,  
  
Just try to step up one more time,  
You'll get it good, get it good right back,  
Watch and wait I'll tell you off,  
Not with any words,  
No, no, no, no, no,  
So listen up, this is goin' great,  
Why you gotta step in and tell me it aint too late,  
I'm like whoa! Who would still go for somebody,  
Who's already messed you up, You askin for it again,  
And I ain't afraid,  
No I'm not,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want you to go,  
Just causin' more trouble as you flow,  
Not gonna happen to me again,  
Boy, there's no way, that I'll fall for you again, cause I'll go,  
Go outta my mind,  
Go completely crazy,  
If you don't think I will just think again,  
No way that I'll put up with this,  
I'll let you go,  
From my mind,  
Go straight on, and continue with my life  
Just go, and forget about you,  
I don't need you,  
No, no  
Watch and wait, you'll go crazy,  
Without seein' me,  
Just go!  
  
You'll see me in whole different way,  
Not talkin' to you, I have nothing to say,  
Nothing at all,  
You're the cause of all my pain,  
And I say to myself,  
'Girl you went crazy before,  
I won't let you go crazy again, again, '  
Why is this day goin' so slow,  
Come on, what's that saign?  
Oh yeah,  
You'll never forget me, even if it's the last thing you do!  
(You, you, you, you,)

"Anything But Ordinary"  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh myself to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
Sometimes I drive so fast  
Just to feel the danger  
I wanna scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive

Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye, my love

Can't hide

We sat by the fire  
United in song  
Under the moonlight  
All night long  
  
We sang 'Hallelujah'  
For the joy of it all  
  
And out on the water  
A caroling loon  
Sings us a sweet  
Heavenly tune  
  
There's peace in God's forest  
The temple of life  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
And back in the city  
I'm losing control  
I need a place  
To ease my soul  
  
There's peace in God's temple  
The temple of life  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Thank you Jesus  
We praise your name  
Thank you Lord  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah

Don't you know that I  
  
I don't give a damn about you, I won't give it up, not for you  
I don't give a damn about you, I won't give it up, not for you  
I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy, a guy who thinks he's all that  
  
(chorus slowly fades)

Lets talk this over  
It's not like we're dead  
Was it something I did  
Was it somethinq you said  
Don't leave me hanging  
In a city so dead  
Held up so high on such a breakable thread  
  
You were all the things I thought I knew  
And I thought we could be  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it.  
All of the memories so close to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending  
So much for my happy ending.  
  
You've got your dumb friends  
I know what they say  
They tell you I'm difficult  
But so are they  
But they don't know me  
Do they even know you  
All the things you hide from me  
All the shit that you do.  
  
You were all the things I thought I knew  
And I thought we could be.  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it  
All of the memories so closed to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending.  
  
Nice to know you were there  
Thanks for acting like you care  
And making me feel like I was the was the only one  
Nice to know we had it all  
Thanks for watching as I fall  
And letting me know we were done.  
  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it  
All of the memories so close to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending  
So much for my happy ending.

See I got a little bit of a problem  
Back where I come from,  
Feels like five people in my population  
And no one ever leaves there  
I'm gonna be the first one  
  
I guess my papa always told me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
See, I got what you would call an obsession  
It feels like I think sane  
The limits of a small town  
Frustrating my brain,  
Might leave some roots there,  
But my head's on the next plane  
  
'Cause my daddy always told me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
Papa always tells me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on New York City  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even miss me  
And I'll get a big boyfriend, just to piss you off  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
  
Here I come, here I come

You're so good to me, baby, baby  
  
I wanna lock you up in my closet  
When no one's around  
I wanna put your hand in my pocket  
Because you're allowed  
I wanna drive you into the corner  
And kiss you without a sound  
I wanna stay this way forever  
I'll say it loud  
  
Now you're in, and you can't get out  
  
[Chorus]  
You make me so hot  
Make me wanna drop  
It's so ridiculous  
I can barely stop  
I can hardly breathe  
You make me wanna scream  
You're so fabulous  
You're so good to me, baby, baby  
You're so good to me, baby, baby  
  
I can make you feel all better  
Just take it in  
And I can show you all the places  
You've never been  
And I can make you say everything  
That you've never said  
And I will let you do anything  
Again and again  
  
Now you're in, and you can't get out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kiss me gently  
Always I know  
Hold me, love me  
Don't ever go, oh, oh  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
You're so good

Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing  
Tired of living like a blind man  
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling  
And this is how you remind me  
  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breaking  
  
And I've been wrong, I've been down  
Into to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
"Are we having fun yet?"  
  
It's not like you didn't know that  
I said I love you and I swear I still do  
And it must have been so bad  
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you  
  
And this is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breaking  
  
And I've been wrong, I've been down  
Into to the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
  
This is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you a heart worth breaking  
  
I've been wrong, I've been down  
To the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"  
  
Are we having fun yet?

Hush hush, shh  
Hush hush  
  
I didn't mean to kiss you  
You didn't mean to fall in love  
I never meant to hurt you  
We never meant for it to mean this much  
Hush hush, now  
  
I wanted to keep you  
Forever next to me  
You know that I still do  
And all I wanted was to believe  
Hush hush, now  
  
So go on, live your life  
So go on, say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I don't ask why  
So this time I won't even try  
Hush hush, now  
Mmm, hush hush, now  
  
When I try to forget you  
I just keep on remembering  
What we had was so true  
And somehow we lost everything  
Hush hush, now  
(Hush hush, now)  
  
So go on, live your life  
So go on, say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I don't ask why, no  
So go on, live your life  
So go on, and say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I don't ask why  
Maybe someday  
But not tonight  
Hush hush, now  
  
Hush hush, now  
Hush hush, now  
  
Don't, don't, don't you ever say a word, word  
Of what you ever thought you heard, heard  
Don't you ever tell a soul  
But you know  
I tried to hide, but I still believe  
We, that we were always meant to be, be  
And I can't never let you go, no  
Hush hush, now  
  
So go on, live your life  
So go on, and say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I don't ask why, no  
So go on, live your life  
So go on, and say goodbye  
So many questions, but I don't ask why  
Maybe someday  
But not tonight  
Hush hush, now, mmm  
Hush hush, now, mmm  
Hush hush,shh

Uh, yeah, you can do it  
  
I couldn't give a damn what you say to me  
I don't really care what you think of me  
'Cause either way you're gonna think what you believe  
There's nothing you could say that would hurt me  
I'm better off without you anyway  
I thought it would be hard, but I'm okay  
I don't need you if you're gonna be that way  
'Cause with me, it's all or nothing  
  
I'm sick of this shit  
Don't deny  
You're a waste of time  
I'm sick of this shit  
Don't ask why  
  
[Chorus]  
I hate you now  
So go away from me  
You're gone  
So long  
I can do better  
I can do better  
Hey, hey, you  
I found myself again  
That's why  
You're gone  
I can do better  
I can do better  
  
You're so full of shit  
I can't stand the way you act  
You just can't comprehend  
I don't think that you can handle it  
I'm way over, over it  
I will drink as much Limoncello as I can  
And I'll do it again and again  
I don't really care what you have to say  
'Cause you know, you know you're nothing  
  
(I'm so sick)  
I'm sick of your shit  
Don't deny  
You're a waste of time  
I'm sick of your shit  
Don't ask why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What'd you say?  
I told you so  
You know that 'cause I always know  
Get outta my face  
Hey, hey  
You're not my taste  
Hey, hey  
I am so sick of you  
You're on my nerves  
I want to puke  
Get outta my face  
Hey, hey  
You're not my taste  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
[Chorus x 2]

I'm the one, I'm the one who knows the dance  
I'm the one, I'm the one who's got the prance  
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants  
I wear the pants  
  
I'm the one who tells you what to do  
You're the one, you're the one if I let you  
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants  
I wear the pants  
  
Hey, you, follow me or take the lead  
Can't you see?  
Don't you question me  
You just do what I say  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't care what you're sayin'  
I don't care what you're thinkin'  
I don't care about anything  
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happening  
I don't care what you're sayin'  
I don't care what you're thinkin'  
I don't care about anything  
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on the scene  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't have to try  
To make you realize  
Anything I wanna do, anything I'm gonna do  
Anything I wanna do I do  
And I don't have to try  
  
Don't you disagree  
'Cause you know it's all about me  
Be at my beck and call  
I'm a know-it-all  
And it's all your fault  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: x2]

My heart is broken into 10, 000 thousand pieces or more  
Cause you hurt me so much  
When I found out I wasn't your one true life  
It was with someone else  
  
I cried every day every night  
Cause I loved you so much  
Why does your heart get broken everytime you fall in love???  
Well you cannot back down to the one you found  
You say you regret everything  
Should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind  
  
I should have listen to my friends  
When they said you're nothing  
It wouldn't last to the end babe  
Never thought it would  
  
I thought you were different  
Bye my love forever i'll miss you  
We'll you're in the past now  
You cannot back down to the one you found  
You say you regret everything  
Should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind  
You're out of my life now!

I'm standing on a bridge  
I'm waitin' in the dark  
I thought that you'd be here by now  
There's nothing but the rain  
No footsteps on the ground  
I'm listening but there's no sound  
  
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?  
Won't somebody come take me home?  
  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you, take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
  
Mm-ee-mm  
  
I'm looking for a place  
I'm searching for a face  
Is anybody here, I know  
Cause nothin's going right  
And everythin's a mess  
And no one likes to be alone  
  
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?  
Won't somebody come take me home  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you.  
I'm with you, yeah you.  
  
Oh, why is everything so confusing?  
Maybe I'm just out of my mind  
Yea yea yea, yea yea yea, yea, oh  
  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
I'm with you.  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
I'm with you  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
Oh  
I'm with you  
I'm with you

Imagine there's no Heaven  
It's easy if you try  
No hell below us  
Above us only sky  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today  
  
Imagine there's no countries  
It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to kill or die for  
No religion too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will be as one  
  
Imagine no possessions  
I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger  
A brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world  
  
And you  
You may say that I'm a dreamer  
I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one

(Avril)  
  
And I'd give up forever to touch you  
'cause I know that you feel me somehow  
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be  
And I don't want to go home right now  
  
And all I can taste is this moment  
And all I can breathe is your life  
'cause sooner or later it's over  
I just don't want to miss you tonight  
  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
(Johnny)  
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming  
Or the moment of truth in your lies  
When everything feels like the movies  
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive  
  
(Both)  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
(Avril)  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
(Both)  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am

Yeah, my boyfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive  
And he doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because  
(Yeah, just because)  
  
And my boyfriend likes U.L. and D.H.C.  
And he's so smart and independent, I don't think he needs me  
Quite half as much as I know I need him  
I wonder why there's not another girl that he'd prefer  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
He's still up watching Vacation, and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
  
Yeah, my boyfriend takes collect calls from the road  
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
He's still up watching Vacation, and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

I need to chill out throw a party with my friends I can't be alone tonight I
need to rock out some punk music and let my hair lie downn

parent permission ohh yeah I'll just relax even if the cops come chasen us

So I chilled out too much drank a little too late drank a little too fast who
cares when your a little shit in high school my lifes going way to fast
there's no way I can relax

[Verse:]  
When I heard that you'd died  
I was stabbed inside  
I'll never be the same again  
I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend  
Even though I never knew you  
From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you  
And your life lost, so young, so new  
And you never realised  
That so many would lose their sleep tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
So don't tell me  
Not to cry  
'cause I'm hurting  
Inside, outside  
Young girl, you're to young to die  
I heard your ambition's high  
Now look me in the eye  
And tell me that I shouldn't cry  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I was there from the start  
When I heard, I gave my heart  
I can't connect how I feel  
With what happened, or what's real  
You felt the fear and then the blow  
You couldn't say goodbye before you go  
I can't sweep aside what I feel  
I can't sweep aside, it's so real  
The cruel world let you die  
So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry  
I was choked up inside  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm feeling like I've got no right  
When there's others who won't sleep for nights  
I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way  
But I can't hold it back another day  
These tears, this song's for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To let you know I care  
But a stab to my heart unprepared  
Left me feeling outta life  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
  
Every time I read those words  
My heart gives in  
I'll never get over it  
It won't kick in  
That you're gone  
I'm sorry that you're gone

You're not alone  
Together we stand  
I'll be by your side  
You know I'll take your hand  
When it gets cold  
  
And it feels like the end  
There's no place to go  
You know I won't give in  
No, I won't give in  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through  
Just stay strong  
'Cause you know I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
There's nothing you could say  
Nothing you could do  
There's no other way when it comes to the truth  
So keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through  
  
So far away  
I wish you were here  
Before it's too late  
This could all disappear  
  
Before the doors close  
And it comes to an end  
With you by my side, I will fight and defend  
I'll fight and defend  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hear me when I say, when I say I believe  
Nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change destiny  
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
La da da da  
La da da da  
La da da da da da da da da  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep holding on  
  
Keep holding on  
  
There's nothing you could say  
Nothing you could do  
There's no other way when it comes to the truth  
So keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through

Love that once hung on the wall  
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing  
The echoes are gone in the hall  
But I still remember, the pain of December  
  
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say  
I'm sorry it's too late  
  
I'm breaking free from these memories  
Gotta let it go, just let it go  
I've said goodbye  
Set it all on fire  
Gotta let it go, just let it go  
  
You came back to find I was gone  
And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me  
Like we were nothing at all  
It's not that you meant to me  
Thought we were meant to be  
  
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say  
I'm sorry it's too late  
  
I'm breaking free from these memories  
Gotta let it go, just let it go  
I've said goodbye  
Set it all on fire  
Gotta let it go, just let it go  
  
I let it go, and now I know  
A brand new life, this tale is rude  
Where it's right, you always know  
So this time, I won't let go  
  
There's only one thing left here to say  
Love's never too late  
  
I've broken free from these memories  
I've let it go, I've let it go  
And two goodbyes, lend you this new life  
Don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
Won't let you go, don't let me go  
Won't let you go, don't let me go  
Won't let you go, don't let me go  
Won't let you go, don't let me go

Making my way downtown, walking fast  
Faces pass and I'm home bound  
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd...  
  
And I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by... ?  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you...  
Tonight  
  
It's always times like these when I think of you  
And I wonder if you ever think of me...  
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong  
Living in your precious me-mo-rys...  
  
'Cause I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by oh  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you...  
Tonight  
  
And I... , I...  
Don't want to let you know  
I... , I...  
Drown in your memory  
I... , I...  
Don't want to let this go  
I, I don't...  
  
Making my way downtown, walking fast  
Faces pass and I'm home bound  
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd...  
And I still need you  
And I still miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky...  
Do you think time would pass us by...  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by  
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
If I could just hold you  
Tonight...

Went back home again  
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again  
Say goodbye to all my friends  
Can't say when I'll be there again  
It's time now to turn around  
Turn my back on  
Everything (turn my back on) everything....  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.  
  
Start back at this life  
Stretch myself back into the vibe  
I'm waking up to say I've tried  
Instead of waking up to another TV GUIDE  
It's time now to turn around  
Turn and walk on this crazy ground oh oh oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile  
Everything's changing out of what I know everywhere I go I'm a mobile  
I'm a mobile  
  
Hanging from the ceiling life's a mobile spinning round  
With mixed feelings crazy and wild...  
Sometimes I want to scream out loud...  
  
Everything's changing  
Everywhere I go  
All out of my control  
Everything's changing  
Everywhere I go out of what I know  
  
La la la la la la (la la)  
La la la la la la (la la)  
La la la la la la (la la la)  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile  
Everything's changing out of what I know everywhere I go I'm a mobile  
I'm a mobile

I will move my little self on  
It won't be very much longer  
One day soon he will find me  
I know this because I believe  
  
If I get to know myself better  
I will be a little bit stronger  
I won't forget everything you told me  
Yeah I miss, the way you'd hold me  
The words you told me  
  
[Chorus]  
Things happen for a reason, you'll become a stronger person  
When life tears you up, then you'll understand  
It's never easy, but you'll know when you get there  
As it tears you down, it builds you up  
Well, it built you up  
  
Some girls fall, just like I did  
They break our hearts, I should've broke his  
Get yourself up, strut along further,  
My advice, you can do better  
Just say whatever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, you said you would love me forever  
Well, blablablablablablabla  
You should maybe watch what you're saying  
Why, why, why  
  
[Chorus] 2x

Please tell me what is taking place,  
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace,  
Guess it must have got erased somehow,  
Probably cause I always forget,  
  
Every time someone tells me their name,  
It's always gotta be the same.  
(In my World)  
Never wore cover-up,  
  
Always beat the boys up,  
Grew up in a 5000 population town,  
Made my money by cutting grass,  
Got fired by fried chicken ass,  
All in a small town, Napanee.  
  
You know I always stay up without sleepin',  
And think to myself,  
Where do I belong forever,  
In whose arms, the time and place?  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't help if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way,  
I may switch off and go in a daydream,  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
But sometimes I can't even speak,  
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World  
  
I never spend less than an hour,  
Washin' my hair in the shower,  
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,  
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,  
Though it may take all friggen day,  
There's nothin' else better to do anyway.  
  
When you're all alone in the lands of forever,  
Lay under the milky way,  
On and on it's getting too late out,  
I'm not in love this time this night.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(La la la la)  
  
Take some time,  
Mellow out,  
Party up,  
But don't fall down,  
Don't get caught,  
Sneak out of the house.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't help if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way,  
I may switch off and go in a daydream,  
  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
But sometimes I can't even speak,  
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

Near to the Heart of God  
  
There is a place of quiet rest,  
Near to the heart of God.  
A place where sin cannot molest,  
Near to the heart of God.  
Refrain  
  
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,  
Sent from the heart of God,  
Hold us who wait before Thee  
Near to the heart of God.  
  
There is a place of comfort sweet,  
Near to the heart of God.  
A place where we our Savior meet,  
Near to the heart of God.  
  
Refrain  
There is a place of full release,  
Near to the heart of God.  
A place where all is joy and peace,  
Near to the heart of God.  
  
Refrain

Fall back  
Take a look at me  
And you'll see I'm for real  
I feel what only I can feel  
  
And if that don't appeal to you  
Let me know  
And I'll go  
'Cause I flow  
  
Better when my colors show  
And that's the way it has to be  
Honestly  
'Cause creativity could never bloom  
  
In my room  
I'd throw it all away before I lie  
So don't call me with a compromise  
Hang up the phone  
I've got a backbone stronger than yours  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
If you're trying to turn me into someone else  
Its easy to see I'm not down with that  
I'm not nobody's fool  
If you're trying to turn me into something else  
I've seen enough and I'm over that  
I'm not nobody's fool  
If you want to bring me down  
Go ahead and try  
Go ahead and try  
  
You don't know  
You think you know me like yourself  
But I fear  
That you're only telling me what I want to hear  
  
But do you give a damn  
Understand  
That I can't not be what I am  
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon  
  
It's not a simple hearing but not so soon  
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen  
And a little more green  
But its amazing what a couple of years can mean  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go ahead and try  
Try and look me in the eye  
But you'll never see inside  
Until you realize, realize  
Things are trying to settle down  
  
Just try to figure out  
Exactly what I'm about  
If its with or without you  
I don't need you doubting me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Would you be laughing out loud  
If I played to my own crowd  
Try

I couldn't tell you  
Why she felt that way  
She felt it everyday  
And I couldn't help her  
I just watched her make  
The same mistakes again  
  
What's wrong, what's wrong now  
Too many, too many problems  
Don't know where she belongs  
Where she belongs.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go  
To dry her eyes  
Broken inside  
  
Open your eyes  
And look outside  
Find the reason why  
You've been rejected  
And now you can't find  
What you left behind  
  
Be strong, be strong now  
Too many, too many problems  
Don't know where she belongs  
Where she belongs.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go  
To dry her eyes  
Broken inside  
  
Her feelings she hides  
Her dreams she can't find  
She's losing her mind  
She's falling behind  
  
She can't find her place  
She's losing her faith  
She's falling from grace  
She's all over the place yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to go home  
But nobody's home  
That's where she lies  
Broken inside  
With no place to go  
No place to go to  
Dry her eyes  
Broken inside  
  
She's lost inside lost inside  
She's lost inside lost inside

You could shake the stars out of the sky  
Doesn't matter, our faiths will collide  
You can pull the plug out  
Watch all the water strain  
Still I know it would be the same,  
Still I know it would be the same  
  
I see it in my mind's eye  
A world made just for you and I  
So I know, it's worth the wait  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, once is enough, that's how I feel  
We do this once and for real  
Love, is strong enough  
So here's the deal,  
We do this once and for real  
  
I'm building my life to include you  
So for now I have someone to look for ado  
I'm in no hurry, no worries, you're out there somewhere  
Still I hope you will be here soon,  
Still I hope you will be here soon  
  
I see it in my mind's eye  
A world made just for you and I  
So I know, it's worth the wait  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(I'm waiting for something)  
(I'm waiting for someone)  
(I'm waiting for you)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(dadadadadada)

I know I'm pathetic, I knew when he said it  
A loser, a bum's what he called me when I drove him home  
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting  
I've done all I can but he still wants to be left alone  
  
You got, you got, you got to help me out  
And I'll try not to argue  
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out  
Mistakes are hard to undo  
  
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong  
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong  
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong  
I think I'm different, this is where I belong  
  
I think it's disgusting, believing and trusting  
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove  
Although it's amusing, it's slightly confusing  
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move  
  
You got, you got, you got to help me out  
And I'll try not to argue  
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out  
Mistakes are hard to undo  
  
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong  
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong  
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong  
I think I'm different, this is where I belong  
  
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong  
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

I saw you at the mall  
Trying on the clothes  
In that little blue stall  
I was watching your feet  
Then a piece of cheese hit the floor  
Ohhh yeah Floor  
Chorus:I'm just a punk princess  
Trying to make it through this life  
Trying to make everything alright  
But all I can picture is the cheese  
Ooh yeah cheese  
Why must you make me hurt so much?  
Why must you eat so much cheese at lunch?  
Why don't you just die, and leave me here like I was  
DIE! DIE!! DIE!!! DIE!!!!!! Die like the Japs at Hiroshima when the atom  
Bomb hit their face and then they died  
(chorus)  
Actually don't die because that's mean,  
And because MTV will break their contract with me  
So don't die  
Pleash?  
Pleash is a word, invented in Spain  
Pleash was invented to symbolize the pain  
The pain that you've put me through  
The pain that I've gained  
But if you die, it will all go away  
All go away  
All go away  
But actually don't die pleash, because I kinda like you a little still  
But not a lot, just a speck  
Like the cheese that's left after I've raided through the fridge  
Why must you remind me of cheese?  
I love cheese but not you  
I only love you a little  
Only a speck  
(chorus)  
(chorus)  
(chorus)

Been seein' too much of you lately  
And you're starting to get on my nerves  
This is exactly what happened last time  
And it's not what we deserve  
  
It's a, a waste of my time lately  
And I'm running out of words  
If it's really meant to be  
Then you can find a way to see  
  
And maybe you should just shut up  
Even when it gets tough  
Baby 'cause this is love  
And you know when push comes to shove  
It's gonna take the both of us  
Baby, this is love  
Baby, this is love  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
  
It's really great to be with you  
This is how I spend my life  
But I'm capable of taking care of myself  
So if you fuck this up then go take a hike  
  
It's a waste of my time  
Shakin' it up,  
Goin' out to search if it's really meant to be  
Then you could find a way to see  
  
Maybe you should just shut up  
Even when it gets tough  
Baby cause this is love  
And you know when push comes to shove  
It's gonna take the both of us  
Baby, this is love  
Baby, this is love  
  
You and me  
We can both start over  
Just the two of us  
We can get a little closer  
  
So follow me  
Honestly  
And you will see, yeah  
  
Maybe you should just shut up  
Even when it gets tough  
Baby 'cause this is love  
And you know when push comes to shove  
It's gonna take the both of us  
Baby, this is love  
Baby, this is love  
  
Maybe you should just shut up  
Even when it gets tough  
Baby 'cause this is love  
And you know when push comes to shove  
It's gonna take the both of us  
Baby, this is love  
Baby, this is love  
  
Love  
Love  
Love

Who the hell are you to tell me  
What I am and what's my master plan  
What makes you think that it includes you  
Self-righteous wealth  
Stop flattering yourself  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-Canadian  
Sucking up to your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
  
What's the difference between you and me  
I do what I want, and you do what you're told  
So listen up shut the hell up  
It's no big deal  
And I'll see you in hell  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-Canadian  
Sucking up to your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
Not my type  
Your not my type  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-American  
  
Falling from grace, right on my face  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone

This vacation's useless  
These white pills aren't kind  
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive  
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9  
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights  
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have  
The days have come and gone  
Our lives went by so fast  
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor  
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me  
Will I shake this off pretend it's all okay  
That there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is  
  
Those notes you wrote me  
I've kept them all  
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall  
With every single letter in every single word  
There will be a hidden message about a boy that  
Loves a girl  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say?  
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say?  
Will ou sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is

I'm tugging at my hair  
I'm pulling at my clothes  
I'm trying to keep my cool  
I know it shows  
I'm staring at my feet  
My cheeks are turning red  
I'm searching for the words inside my head  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could say what I want to say  
I'd say I want to blow you, away  
Be with you every night  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
Marry me today  
Guess, I'm wishing my life away  
With these things I'll never say  
  
It don't do me any good  
It's just a waste of time  
What use is it to you  
What's on my mind  
If ain't coming out  
We're not going anywhere  
So why can't I just tell you that I care  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's wrong with my tongue  
These words keep slipping away  
I stutter, I stumble  
Like I've got nothing to say  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
Guess I'm wishing my life away with these things I'll never say  
If I could say what I want to say  
I'd say I want to blow you, away  
Be with you every night  
  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
  
Marry me today  
Guess I'm wishing my life away  
With these things I'll never say  
These things I'll never say

I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did  
I never wanted to, I didn't hear from you  
And you weren't there for me so that is what happened.  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
Yeah, you should think about it  
  
It's time to have my fun, there's no way it's done  
"Take it with no regrets" and that is what I'll do  
I'll never understand where you were coming from  
And where did you go? You weren't there for me  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
There's only so much we can do  
Can we do without it?  
There's only so much you can say  
Did you forget about it?  
Did you forget about it?  
  
I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
There's only so much we can do  
Can we do without it?  
There's only so much you can say  
Did you forget about it?  
Did you forget about it?  
  
I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did

Something just isn't right  
I can feel it inside  
The truth isn't far behind me  
You can't deny  
  
When I turn the lights out  
When I close my eyes  
Reality overcomes me  
I'm living a lie  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
This has gone on so long  
I realize that i need  
Something good to rely on  
Something for me  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
My heart is broken  
I'm lying here  
My thoughts are choking on you my dear  
On you my dear  
On you my dear  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you  
I don't feel together  
I don't feel together  
  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you  
I don't feel together  
I don't feel together

And I want to believe you,  
When you tell me that it'll be ok,  
Ya I try to believe you,  
But I don't  
  
When you say that it's gonna be,  
It always turns out to be a different way,  
I try to believe you,  
Not today, today, today, today, today  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how I'll feel,  
Tomorrow, tomorrow,  
I don't know what to say,  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
Is a different day  
  
It's always been up to you,  
It's turning around,  
It's up to me,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do,  
Just don't  
  
Give me a little time,  
Leave me alone a little while,  
Maybe it's not too late,  
Not today, today, today, today, today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know how I'll feel,  
Tomorrow, tomorrow,  
I don't know what to say,  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
Is a different day  
  
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, and I know I'm not ready,  
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, maybe tomorrow  
  
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, and I know I'm not ready,  
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, maybe tomorrow  
  
And I want to believe you,  
When you tell me that it'll be okay,  
Yeah I try to believe you,  
Not today, today, today, today, today  
  
Tomorrow it may change [Repeat: x4]

Yeah, yeah  
Yeah-eah, yeah  
Yeah-eah, yeah  
  
Why do you look so familiar  
I could swear that I have seen your face before  
  
I think I like that you seem sincere  
I think I like to get to know you a little bit more  
  
[Chorus]  
I think there's something more, life's worth living for  
Who knows what could happen.  
Do what you do, just keep on laughing  
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day  
  
Yeah, yeah,  
Yeah-eah, yeah,  
Yeah-eah, yeah  
  
How do you always have an opinion  
And how do you always find the best way to compromise  
We don't need to have a reason  
We don't need anything  
We're just wasting time  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I think there's something more, life's worth living for  
Who knows what could happen.  
Do what you do, just keep on laughing  
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  
Who knows what could happen.  
Do what you do, just keep on laughing  
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day  
  
Find yourself, cause I can't find you  
Be yourself, who are you?  
Find yourself, cause I can't find you  
Be yourself, who are you?  
  
Who knows what could happen.  
Do what you do, just keep on laughing  
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  
  
So you go and make it happen  
Do your best just keep on laughing  
It's all on you, there's always a brand new day  
  
[Chorus]  
Who knows what could happen.  
Do what you do, just keep on laughing  
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

I can be tough  
I can be strong  
But with you, it's not like that at all  
  
There's a girl  
That gives a shit  
Behind this wall  
You've just walked through it  
  
And I remember, all those crazy things you said  
You left them running through my head  
You're always there, you're everywhere  
But right now I wish you were here  
  
All those crazy things we did  
Didn't think about it, just went with it  
You're always there, you're everywhere  
But right now I wish you were here  
  
Damn, damn, damn,  
What I'd do to have you  
Here, here, here  
I wish you were here  
Damn, damn, damn  
What I'd do to have you  
Near, near, near  
I wish you were here  
  
I love the way you are  
It's who I am, don't have to try hard  
We always say, say it like it is  
And the truth is that I really miss  
  
All those crazy things you said  
You left them running through my head  
You're always there, you're everywhere  
But right now I wish you were here  
  
All those crazy things we did  
Didn't think about it, just went with it  
You're always there, you're everywhere  
But right now I wish you were here  
  
Damn, damn, damn  
What I'd do to have you  
Here, here, here  
I wish you were here  
Damn, damn, damn  
What I'd do to have you  
Near, near, near  
I wish you were here  
  
No, I don't wanna let go  
I just wanna let you know  
That I never wanna let go  
Let go, oh, oh  
  
No, I don't wanna let go  
I just wanna let you to know  
That I never wanna let go  
(let go let go let go let go let go let go let go)  
  
Damn, damn, damn,  
What I'd do to have you  
Here, here, here  
I wish you were here (i wish you were)  
Damn, damn, damn  
What I'd do to have you  
Near, near, near  
I wish you were here  
  
Damn, damn, damn,  
What I'd do to have you  
Here, here, here  
I wish you were here  
Damn, damn, damn  
What I'd do to have you  
Near, near, near  
I wish you were here

[Verse:]  
When you're falling, you're crushing  
When your fire has turn to ashes  
You're screaming, your heart is bleeding  
When you're feeling like there's no reason  
  
[Refrain]  
I won't let you go  
No I, I won't let you go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause when you're all alone, and it's cold and there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling down just remember  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you're torn down, when you're messed up  
Don't you give in  
No, don't you give up.  
When you're drowning, and you're fading  
Always know that, I'm always waiting  
  
[Refrain]  
And I, I won't let you go  
No, I won't let you go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause when you're all alone, and it's cold and there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling down just remember, remember, remember  
  
[Bridge:]  
When I said forever, I know that I meant forever  
And I won't let you down, I can always be found, and I'm always around  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you're all alone, it's cold, there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, nowhere  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling bad just remember  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
Won't let you go
