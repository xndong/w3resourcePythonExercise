We get up early and we work all day  
We put our time in 'cause we like to stay up  
All night long  
  
We keep on grinnin' till the weekend comes  
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum  
All night long, all night long  
  
Start in the morning and get the job done  
Take care of bus'ness and we have some fun  
All night long, all night long  
  
We like a long neck and a good old song  
Turn it up and then we sing along  
Sing along  
We're all stayin' up all night long  
  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long

Well, I heard some people talking just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
Well, let me tell you I've got some news for you  
And you'll soon find out it's true  
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-ling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right  
And I'm-al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eeling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free  
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains  
That we never even know we have the key  
Me, I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song, coz I'm already gone  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, coz I'm al-ready gone  
Yes, I'm already gone, already gone (awright, nighty night)  
Already gone, already gone

Once I was young and so unsure  
I'd try any ill to find the cure  
An old man told me  
Tryin' to scold me  
"Oh, son, don't wade to deep in Bitter Creek,"  
(Bitter Creek)  
Out where the desert meets the sky  
Is where I go when I want to hide  
  
Oh, peyote (oh,peyote,mm)  
She tried to show me  
(tried to show me)  
You know there ain't no cause to weep  
at Bitter Creek  
(Bitter Creek)  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
We're gonna hit the road for one last time  
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind  
All that money (All that money,ooh..)  
No more runnin' (No more runnin')  
I can't wait to see the old man's face  
When I win the race  
(Bitter Creek)  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo.........

Early in the morning  
About the break of day  
The earlybird is working  
So his life don't fade away  
Spends his life denying that  
He's got no time for flying  
In the breeze  
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone  
And he is free  
  
Earlybird is scratching though  
The going's getting tough  
Time is passing by him and he just  
Can't get enough  
  
He'll tell you all is well when  
All is really going wrong  
The earlybird will wake one day  
And find his life is gone  
You know I like to lay in bed  
And sleep out in the sun  
Reading books and playing crazy music  
Just for fun  
  
You know it makes feel so fine  
And puts my mind at ease to  
Know that I don't harm a soul  
In doing what I please  
  
Any old day you say,  
Ain't gonna fade away  
Any old day you say,  
Ain't gonna fade away

You're the only one who's ever heard my song  
I might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long  
Take a look at me, baby  
Tell me, what do you see?  
Take a look at me, baby  
You're lookin' at the brand new me  
  
I'm like a total stranger knockin' at your door  
No need to worry 'bout the way I was before  
It's a new love story  
So read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
I'm guilty of the crime  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
  
I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you  
'Cause there's nothin' more that I would rather do  
It's a new love story  
Got to read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
I'm guilty of the crime  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Yes, I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, lovin' you  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Yes I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime

[Verse 1]  
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair,  
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air.  
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light.  
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night.  
There she stood in the doorway,  
I heard the mission bell.  
And I was thinking to myself,  
This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.  
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way.  
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to the Hotel California,  
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place),  
Such a lovely face.  
Plenty of room at the Hotel California,  
Any time of year (any time of year),  
You can find it here.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she's got the Mercedes Benz.  
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends.  
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat,  
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.  
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine."  
He said "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969."  
And still those voices are calling from far away,  
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to the Hotel California,  
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place),  
Such a lovely face.  
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California,  
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise),  
Bring your alibies.  
  
[Outro]  
Mirrors on the ceiling, and pink champagne on ice,  
And she said "We are all just prisoners here,  
Of our own device."  
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast,  
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast.  
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door,  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.  
"Relax", said the nightman, "We are programed to receive."  
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.

Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train  
I've run just as far as I can run  
If I never see the good old days shinin' in the sun  
I'll be doin' fine and then some  
  
[Chorus]  
How long, how long  
Woman will you weep  
How long, how long  
Rock yourself to sleep  
  
Well I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine  
Just outside, the freedom river runs  
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind  
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)  
Everyone is out there on the loose  
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name  
But what you get is not quite what you choose  
  
Tell me, how long, how long  
Woman will you weep  
How long, how long  
Rock yourself to sleep  
  
How long, how long (long and drawn out)  
Muddy River runs so deep  
How long, how long (long and drawn out)  
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep,  
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep,  
Be-be-be Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep

Somewhere out there on that horizon  
Out beyond the neon lights  
I know there must be somethin' better  
But there's nowhere else in sight  
It's survival in the city  
When you live from day to day  
City streets don't have much pity  
When you're down, that's where you'll stay  
In the city, oh, oh.  
In the city  
  
I was born here in the city  
With my back against the wall  
Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty  
No one's there to catch you when you fall  
Somewhere out on that horizon  
Faraway from the neon sky  
I know there must be somethin' better  
And I can't stay another night  
In the city, oh, oh.  
In the city  
  
In the city  
  
In the city  
  
In the city

I like to go out every now and then  
I can't wait to do it again  
But I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
I like to step out every once in a while  
I kind of like to do it in style  
I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone  
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
'Cause I like the way that sounds  
It's a perfect occupation  
For me  
I don't mind being by myself  
If there's no one else around  
It's the last good time in town  
  
Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job  
Stay up late with the same old mob  
But it hasn't crossed my mind  
Lately  
  
Put on a suit, work downtown  
Then come up when the sun goes down  
No, I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Closin' the curtains, play jazz on trombone  
(Jazz on trombone, jazz on trombone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
No, you won't see me around  
It's a perfect situation  
For me  
I don't mind being by myself  
'Cause I know you'll come on down  
It's the last good time in town  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone  
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
'Cause I like the way that sounds  
It's a perfect occupation  
For me, yes it is  
I don't mind being by myself  
If you don't see me around  
It's the last good time, last good time in town

It's just another day in paradise  
As you stumble to your bed  
You'd give anything to silence  
Those voices ringing in your head  
You thought you could find happiness  
Just over that green hill  
You thought you would be satisfied  
But you never will-  
Learn to be still  
  
We are like sheep without a shepherd  
We don't know how to be alone  
So we wander 'round this desert  
And wind up following the wrong gods home  
But the flock cries out for another  
And they keep answering that bell  
And one more starry-eyed messiah  
Meets a violent farewell-  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
Now the flowers in your garden  
They don't smell so sweet  
Maybe you've forgotten  
The heaven lying at your feet  
  
There are so many contradictions  
In all these messages we send  
(We keep asking)  
How do I get out of here  
Where do I fit in?  
Though the world is torn and shaken  
Even if your heart is breakin'  
It's waiting for you to awaken  
And someday you will-  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
You just keep on runnin'  
Keep on runnin'

I was standing  
Alone against the world outside  
You were searching  
For a place to hide  
  
Lost and lonely  
Now you've given me the will to survive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
  
Don't you worry  
Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride  
The world is changing  
Right before your eyes  
Now I've found you  
There's no more emptiness inside  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
  
I would die for you  
Climb the highest mountain  
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do  
  
I was standing  
Alone against the world outside  
You were searching  
For a place to hide  
Lost and lonely  
Now you've given me the will to survive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
  
A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay  
So throw your rope on another man  
And pull him down your way  
Make him into someone who can take the place of me  
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be  
  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer,  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe, maybe San Antone,  
Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone  
Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind  
'Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine  
  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on

Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
I've been shadows of myself  
How was i to know?  
  
Tell me scarlet sun  
What will time allow?  
We have brought our children  
Here who can save them now?  
  
Oh, weeping woman try to smile  
Like the coming dawn  
Most of us are sad it's true  
Still we must go on  
  
Love was here today  
Oh the sun was bright  
I will sing you faraway  
Love is here tonight  
  
Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
I've been shadows of myself  
How was i to know?

Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
  
To live without my music  
Would be impossible to do  
In this world of troubles  
My music pulls me through  
  
Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
And music of the past  
And music of the past  
  
Music was my first love  
And it will be my last  
Music of the future  
And music of the past  
  
To live without my music  
Would be impossible to do  
'Cause in this world of troubles  
My music pulls me through

Everybody Partys on a New Year's Eve

I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know  
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby  
Just want to let them roll  
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy  
I'll tell you why  
I got a woman who can take me there  
The apple of my eye  
Oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no  
Oh, I love her so  
Don't let me see that morning paper  
'Cause I don't need those dues  
It's just the same old murder movie  
But they call it the news  
I'll tell you what would be some story  
And what would set me free  
Is if the same thing happened to everybody  
That just happened to me  
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
Oh, I'll never let her go, no, no, no  
And every time I hear somebody  
Sneakin' up behind  
Oh, I turn around but I still hear that sound  
And just when I'm about to lose my mind  
Here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way  
Down along that devastation trail  
Well, tell the Lord above  
She's got a brand of love that cannot fail  
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
And that's no lie  
I'm hanging on to my special friend  
The apple of my eye  
The apple of my eye, my inspiration too  
She's got a lead on my heart and my soul  
And she knows just what to do  
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
Oh, I get so low and my mind's about to go  
But wait a minute, here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way  
Down along that devastation trail  
Well, let the fires burn  
And let the floods return, we will prevail  
Hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know  

Sitting by a foggy window  
Staring at the pouring rain  
Falling down like lonely teardrops  
Memories of love in vain  
These cloudy days, make you wanna cry  
It breaks your heart when someone leaves and you don't know why  
  
I can see that you've been hurting, maybe I've been lonely too  
I've been out here lost and searching, looking for a girl like you  
Now I believe the sun is gonna shine  
Don't you be afraid to love again, put your hand in mine?  
  
Baby, I would never make you cry  
I would never make you blue  
I would never let you down  
I would never be untrue  
  
I know a place where we can go where true love always stays  
There?s no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days  
  
I believe in second chances  
I believe in angels, too  
I believe in new romances  
Baby, I believe in you  
These cloudy days are coming to an end  
And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again  
  
Baby, I would never make you cry  
I would never make you blue  
I would never turn away  
I would never be untrue  
I know a place where we can go where true love always stays  
There's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days

Used to be so easy to give my heart away  
But I found out the hard way  
There's a price you have to pay  
I found out that love was no friend of mine  
I should have known time after time  
  
So long, it was so long ago  
But I've still got the blues for you  
  
Used to be so easy to fall in love again  
But I found out the hard way  
It's a road that leads to pain  
I found that love was more than just a game  
You're playin' to win  
But you lose just the same  
  
So long, it was so long ago  
But I've still got the blues for you  
  
So many years since I've seen your face  
Here in my heart, there's an empty space  
Where you used to be  
  
So long, it was so long ago  
But I've still got the blues for you  
  
Though the days come and go  
There is one thing I know  
I've still got the blues for you

Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load  
I've got seven women on my mind  
Four that want to own me, two that want to stone me  
One says she's a friend of mine  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy  
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona  
Such a fine sight to see  
It's a girl my Lord in a flat-bed Ford  
Slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win, though we will never be here again  
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy  
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

She's one of a kind  
Sometimes hard to find  
Like a rainbow  
  
Well, she's lost all her glory  
And could tell you some stories  
That we all should know  
  
And there's too many hands  
Being laid on her  
Too many eyes will never see  
That it's dragging her down  
But you won't hear a sound as  
She turns 'round  
  
Her beauty all aflight  
It always seems to turn the tide  
At midnight  
  
And for her there is no rest  
We are doing what is best  
For our future  
  
One of these days she may not  
Be so good to you  
One of these days she might  
Shake you to the ground  
But her fire is still burning  
And her heart is still yearning to be found  
  
Too many hands  
Being laid on her  
Too many eyes will never see  
That it's dragging her down  
Still you won't hear a sound as  
She turns 'round  
  
Too many hands  
Too many hands

I lost ten points just for being in the right place  
at exactly the wrong time  
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have  
been completely blind  
So, if you see me walking all alone  
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home  
there's a train leaves here this morning, and  
I don't know, what I might be on  
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would  
all be so life long  
I looked around then for a reason  
when there wasn't something more to blame it on  
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone  
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on  
There's a train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on  
ooo, ooo, ooo.. etc...  
1320 North Columbus was the address  
that I wrote down on my sleeve  
I don't know just what she wanted  
might have been that it was getting time to leave  
and I watched as the smoker passed it on  
and I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on."  
cause there's a train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on  
And there's train leaves here this morning  
and I don't know, what I might be on

Twenty-one and strong as I can be  
I know what freedom means to me  
And I can't give the reason why  
I should ever want to die  
Got no cause to be afraid  
Or fear that life will ever fade  
'Cause as I watch the rising sun  
I know that we have just begun  
  
I might spend my life upon the road  
Just tryin' to add to what I know  
Then someday I might settle down  
And all my friends will be around  
  
They say a man should have a stock and trade  
But me, I'll find another way  
I believe in getting what you can  
And there ain't no stoppin' this young man  
  
Because I'm you and fast as I can be  
I know what freedom means to me  
And I can't give the reason why,  
I should ever want to die  
No I can't give the reason why  
I should ever want to die

Say goodbye to all your pain and sorrow  
Say goodbye to all those lonely nights  
Say goodbye to all your blue tomorrows  
Now you're standing in the light  
  
I know sometimes you feel so helpless  
Sometimes you feel like you can't win  
Sometimes you feel so isolated  
You'll never have to feel that way again  
  
You are not alone  
You're not alone  
  
Never thought I'd find the road to freedom  
Never thought I'd see you smile again  
Never thought I'd have the chance to tell you  
That I will always be your friend  
  
You are not alone  
You're not alone
