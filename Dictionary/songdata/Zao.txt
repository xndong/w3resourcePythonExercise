(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is
Jesus.

We are a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come.  
Reconcile us to Himself, through Christ Jesus.  
We will be free, forever knowing what will become... of us.  
Thank you for the cross.  
Trusting in the balance has tilted me towards righteousness.  
Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my functioning.  
Inhale, exhale this over and over again.  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today.  
Dying, dying.  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth,  
With love and understanding.  
Now I look to importance, standing here steadfast,  
To renew (the? or Your?) spirit within me.  
Do not cast me from Your presence,  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me

Your eyes  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
  
For so long I've wanted to come home  
Held back by lies of serpents and tongues of brothers  
Turning a child into an enemy  
Turning open arms into closed fists  
  
I could see the reflection in the tears  
That made their way down Your face  
Onto the ground I kneel upon  
They form a river that overtakes me  
Compassion envelops me  
I forgive and release  
Forgive, release  
Forgiven, released

We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we sing there praises.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we kiss their hands.  
The morning rained fire.  
Let heavens retire.  
Over the eyes of the blind.  
And the voices of spoiled children.  
True leaders are gone.  
We turned our backs to many times.  
And bit the hand of the provider.  
Chaos kills us.  
Chaos

Put your coal to my trembling lips.  
Voice fills void with your breath.  
Crescent tears from the relief you bring.  
Undone in you. I love you.  
Broken teeth of my frustration.  
Your glory it surrounds me.  
Sing praises to God, sing praises.  
  
Blanket my mind  
with your wisdom and insight.  
Hand molds the mud of my heart.  
Joy of your strength  
Overwhelms my praise.  
Quickened in you.  
I praise you.  
Vibrant peace envelopes my lack.  
Your glory it surrounds me.  
  
Sing praises to God.  
  
Sing praises.  
  
Put your coal to my trembling lips.  
Voice fills void with your breath.  
Crescent tears from the relief you bring.  
Undone in you. I love you.  
Broken teeth of my frustration.  
Your glory it surrounds me.  
Your glory it surrounds me.  
  
Put your coal (to my trembling lips.)  
Voice fills void (with your breath.)  
Crescent tears (from the relief you bring.)  
Undone in you. I love you

Once again to strive, to beat it out  
Over and over again.  
So worn, worked over  
With the intention to kill.  
To watch him die and smile  
At his dismay,  
His pain,  
My deliverance.  
My cleanliness a gift of freedom.  
My walk purified.  
My peace given by God.  
  
What else is there  
After slipping away,  
When every thing is silent  
And nothing else is around?  
Alone.  
Looking deep inside.  
Hearing the echo of my soul,  
No one can know.  
  
In these times of silence,  
These times of separation,  
I find there is a void that rises up,  
A peace that brings my tears,  
A comfort that no one else can offer.  
  
So why do people run away?  
Why do they look elsewhere  
And base their self on opinions  
When the truth is so evident that this God of  
Love is so constant?  
Destruction and storms.  
My Jesus stands to help

When you shut your eyes and fell asleep  
Dark clouds descended on the souls of the ones  
Who held you close to their hearts  
Close to their hearts  
  
My heart broke  
My heart broke  
My heart broke  
Open  
Open  
Open  
Open  
  
The beauty of an embrace a place  
To lay down the pain  
  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
  
I sit away in a secret place the shadow of wings  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
And my heart breaks open
