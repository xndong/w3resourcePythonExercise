All  
All along the rocks  
It's good  
It's not so hard now  
  
I  
I bite my tongue  
Who cares?  
There's chance to draw on  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Children  
He'll never come  
I know it's written  
I lost my thumb  
  
He  
Could talk me down  
Still lost it  
It's just her goal  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

Black phoebe  
There's a candle in my window  
Black phoebe  
Its all inside of you  
Black phoebe  
There's a candle in my window  
  
Baby captain  
I hope those teary eyes  
Are only from x  
And I hope they  
Don't dry  
When your biking photos  
Set you free  
And you see  
What a stunner you are  
  
'Cappy captain  
I hope that white gold girl  
Forgets about you  
Your crooked blood  
Seeps up from hell  
And you see  
What a stunner you are  
  
Black phoebe  
There's a candle in my window  
Black phoebe  
Its all inside of you  
Black phoebe  
There's a candle in my window

This blue dot of sickly light  
That is daytime in your embarrassed town  
Burns a hole in the fading yellow ribbon  
On your fading wine colored Cavaliere  
the mine has fallen down on you  
As you dug a well of death  
Milk and sugar water  
In brief sympathy with them  
when we see the hate in your eyes  
It doesn't make us better men  
The mine has crushed your brother  
As he ruined our rotting sky  
A white blast of black hot powder  
As you lapse into a real boy  
the mine has fallen down on you  
As you dug a well of death  
Tears of sugar water flow  
In briefest sympathy with them  
should you be ashamed for more than that?  
Than that your daddy raped you silly  
Leaning my head on the refrigerator  
Crying for the stupid world we share  
walla walla walla walla walla walla walla hey  
  
  

Why ask  
Why not it goes with this night  
So will it ever stop  
Will it always be this hard  
  
There will always be a jar of ash  
There will always be an unfit mind  
There will always be a lonely son  
There will always be a humiliated little girl  
  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
If it'll just let up  
  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
If it'll just let up  
  
Up up up up  
There will always be a headless neck  
There will always be happiness  
There will always be a handless wrist to crush  
  
There will always be a hopeful heart to disrespect  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
  
If it'll just let up  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
  
If it'll just let up  
Up up up up

Daniella,  
Don't say be tender first  
And don't say teach me  
Before you get tied up for your first time  
I'm not like that  
I'm not so good you will want to  
Run away for us  
your black hair is like black hair  
Mine I promise is a jerk's hair  
Your acne is like a pearl  
Mine I swear is a brimstone  
I'm not like that  
How is it you thought I might be?  
I'm not like that  
I'm not like that  
All I'll recall of you:  
A sturdy tongue like a blistered toe  
  
  

Telling your son a joke  
He doesn't think is funny  
We'll catch him unawares but  
What if he doesn't wear underwear.  
Lighting it up  
You were so cool  
Her school colors  
Black and light black  
Giving it up  
She has started  
Your life's colors  
Black and light black  
Getting your hair from under your bed  
Breaking your fingers  
Getting killed by a car  
Before you can make him pay.

A witch has come from under the ocean  
And with a pointed and sharp finger  
Snatched my baby by the crook of her jaw  
And hooked her breath away  
And bloated and cut her soft,  
Dearest skin and face  
Her hair has gone from black to green  
She used to complain when I used  
Too much water to wash her hair  
I can't imagine what it was like for her  
To have died swallowing the sea  
I want to pause and offer  
Your lonely grave farewell but it is covered in mud  
It is nowhere there is no way  
To light an altar for you  
Everything is too wet  
Tight around my neck  
Tie me with this rotten wire  
That snaps its quiet snap  
I've poured my life into this world and here I am

I know you like me  
I know you do  
That's why when I come around  
She's all over you  
And I know you want me too  
It's easy to see  
And in the back of your mind  
You know you should be on with me  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
Fight the feeling  
Leave it alone  
'Cause if it ain't love  
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home  
Let's keep it friendly  
You have to play fair  
See I don't care but I know  
She ain't gonna wanna share  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
I know she loves you  
I understand  
I'd probably be just as crazy about you  
If you were my own man  
Maybe next lifetime  
Possibly  
Until then old friend  
Let's just see if you can hang with me  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?  
  
  

I know it's dumb to say,  
That you are on my mind.  
I know it's stupid to dream,  
That you might think of me as a man.  
I can loose my own tie knot,  
I can button up my own pants.  
I can buy my own cigarettes,  
I can pluck my own moustache.  
I read it's lame to wish,  
That you won't walk out on me.  
I'm not embarrassed to sing,  
Plainly the words love and your name.  
I can pay all my own bills,  
I can unroll my own tights.  
I can untuck all I have to untuck,  
I can weep through my own midnights.  
I can loose my own tie knot,  
I can button up my own pants.  
I can buy my own cigarettes,  
I can pluck my own moustache.  
I can pay all my own debts,  
I can rip off my own tights.  
I can humiliate myself to your face,  
I can weep through my own midnights.  
  

I did something bad  
I got in a fight  
About drugs  
Kicked him in the neck  
  
I am helsabot  
I am all you're not  
But you wish you were  
  
I am working hard  
Don't you laugh at me  
I am helsabot  
Alcohol fueled robot  
  
I take off my clothes  
Then I say to joe  
"do your pants ever just fall off?"  
A menage-et-trois' fine  
  
I am helsabot  
I am all you're not  
But you wish you were  
  
I am working hard  
Don't you laugh at me  
I am helsabot  
Alcohol fueled robot

It was not posed  
It messed me up  
It was her recording herself  
Whisper.  
"What is it worth to me?"  
Thinking one thought  
The advice to be okay.  
Break into children's hospital  
Cry it out.  
"don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me"  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
Its a mess  
Go go go go go  
Away from here.  
Food color poured out all over her shorts mixed with  
I'll make a gate you cannot pass  
Taped to there loinclothes  
A sign that says "Why us?"  
Flip yourself off but erase it when someone sees you.  
"This, this is the worst vacation ever, I am going to cut open your  
Forehead with a roofing shingle, Ohh Ohh"  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
And I broke up  
Behind your house  
And I broke up  

Someday J.S.  
When you tell me everything  
It will make me want to take it too far  
And when you ask me everything  
I will take it too far  
The twenty-hundred private loops making up my  
Ahh!  
Ian Curtis, I can't believe I said it, wishlist  
Via heave and via gasp  
Will seem like and will actually be  
Just wicked stupid pride  
Oh, what will happen  
Oh, what will happen  
Will you ever bleep out  
Do you love me Jamie Stewart?  
J.S., I am kidding  
I'm just kidding  
  

You say I am a looker  
Because I am a girl  
You say I'm stupid  
Because I am your girl  
  
Leave me out on the steps  
Dress me up like a boy  
Say I am your secret love  
Say to be quiet, but I want to tell the whole world  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
I'm your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
I'm your girl and I will protect you  
  
Get into the back of my little car  
Pull up my pants and fix my bra  
Go on home, go home to your kids  
I'm not gonna be quiet, I'm gonna tell the whole block  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
I'm your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
I'm your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
I'm your girl and I will protect you

Though this is all you'll ever get  
It would be a strange delight  
No eyes no nose no mind  
The grey light of Porto stay with you  
Oh how can you love a tiny bug impressed  
By the night when you cut yourself?  
Save me save me  
Your body rotten as the last melon on the vine  
Pull your shirt down save me save me  
Press my thumb onto your tongue  
Hand a knife up to me  
No mouth no neck no rest  
The white poem of self hate stays with you  
Even though you know a chance to cut  
Is still a chance to cure  
Pull your legs apart  
Save me save me  
Your body doomed as the last apple on the tree  
So let me hurt you.  
  
  

Black lung got you down tonight  
Saving it all for work  
Suha pins her arms to her side  
Watching her twin want to die  
  
I hate my body, I hate the desert  
Please, let me escape  
When will I be going home?  
I hate my husband, I hate my childeren  
I'm going to hang myself  
When will I be going home?  
  
Black hair got you down tonight  
Black love, black cuts from your work  
Weep like the busted girl you are  
Wash down your hope in that car  
  
My name is Suha, I'm 25 years old  
I'm going to hump a cop  
When will I be going home?

Can I pray for your return?  
The bird I am looking for is not in me  
It is you  
It's so clear you missed it  
What we saw in you  
Green like flame  
someone felt something pure  
And told it all to you  
That was why you killed yourself  
To prove it wasn't true  
say hello to Cory's mom  
Say hello to Freddy's mom  
Say hello to Ryan's mom  
we're all and have been  
On your side  
What is worse for you to bear?  
it's obscene  
Why you missed  
What they saw in you  
Grey like flame  
can I pray for your return?  
  
  

I'm ready to go,  
It's creeping along.  
A deep lack of guilt,  
And fool's sense of love.  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
Greased and unclean,  
A hiss laid by God.  
A duped bridle hole,  
And a boyhood slipping in Blood.  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
V you L T you are E - P I A N O!!  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
  

No one will eat him  
A yellow raspberry  
Perched on top of the thorn bush  
Up high and ugly  
Up high and weird  
This minute 20 years ago  
Your hair looked just as bad  
Talking nonstop to a little rubber pixie  
What has changed when you tell  
Your doll hello?  
More indignant, less recognizable  
You became a bag lady's son  
Beating off non stop  
To the escort pages  
What has changed when you tell  
The cross hello?  
You left with some money  
More self righteous, less hopeful  
Up high and ugly up high and ZORP  
This minute 20 seconds ago  
Your face looks just as dumb  
Singing nonsense to your voice mail  
What has changed as you tell  
Your cactus hello?  
More fixated, less relief  
You became a faggot  
Dressed like a bunny  
Beating off nonostop  
To the escort pages  
What has changed as you tell  
The mirror hello?
