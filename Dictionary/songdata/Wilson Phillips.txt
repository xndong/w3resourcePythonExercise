Alone, alone with a sky of romance above  
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do  
Who ever you are, are you, are you  
Alone, alone on this night that we two could share  
Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care  
And when you come I'll promise to be your very own  
Alone, alone with a heart meant for you alone, alone  
  
Alone, alone with a sky of romance above  
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do  
Who ever you are, are you, are you  
Alone, alone on this night that we two could share  
Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care  
And when you come I'll promise to be your very own

Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
But let me tell you I got news for you  
And you'll soon find out it's true  
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
'Cause I'm already gone  
And I'm feelin' strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo  
  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
But remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light (that's right)  
  
And I'm already gone (I'm already gone)  
And I'm feelin' strong (now I'm feelin' strong)  
I will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo, hoo,hoo  
  
Well I know it wasn't you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free (oh baby)  
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains  
And we never even know we have the key  
Oh no  
  
But me, I'm already gone (I'm already gone)  
And I'm feelin' strong (now I'm feelin' strong)  
I will sing this vict'ry song  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone  
And I'm feelin' strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone

Sitting in a park in Paris, France  
Reading the news and it sure looks bad  
They won't give peace a chance  
That was just a dream some of us had  
Still a lot are left to see  
But I wouldn't want to stay here  
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here  
Oh, but California  
California I'm coming home  
I'm going to see the folks I dig  
I'll even kiss a sunset pig  
California I'm coming home  
  
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle  
Who did the goat dance very well  
He gave me back my smile  
But he kept my camera to sell  
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue  
He cooked good omelettes and stews  
And I might have stayed on with him there  
But my heart cried out for you, California  
California I'm coming home  
Oh make me feel good rock 'n roll band  
I'm your biggest fan  
California, I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When you're walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
Just gives you the blues  
Just gives you the blues  
  
So I bought me a ticket  
I caught a plane to Spain  
Went to a party down a red dirt road  
There were lots of pretty people there  
Reading rolling stone, reading vogue  
They said, how long can you hang around?  
I said a week, maybe two,  
Just until my skin turns brown  
Then I'm going home to California  
California I'm coming home  
Will you take me as I am  
Strung out on another man  
California I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
Yeah  
Take me as I am  
Will you  
Will you

Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and, I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it loks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  
  
They say Spain's pretty  
Though I've never been  
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen  
Oh and, he should know 'cause he's been there enough  
Lord I miss Daniel  
Oh I miss him so much  
  
Oh, Daniel my brother  
you are older then me  
Do you still feel the pain  
of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died  
But you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star  
in the face of the sky  
  
I miss Daniel  
Oh I miss him so much  
  
Oh, Daniel my brother  
you are older then me  
Do you still feel the pain  
of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died  
But you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star  
in the face of the sky  
  
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and, I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it loks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  
Oh God,  
It looks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  

While I'm far away from you, my baby,  
I know it's hard for you, my baby,  
Because it's hard for me, my baby,  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
Each night before you go to bed, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby.  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love.  
  
Love can never be exactly like we want it to be.  
I could be satisfied knowing you love me.  
There's one thing I want you to do especially for me  
And it's something that everybody needs.  
  
While I'm far away from you, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby,  
Because it's hard for me, my baby,  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn.  
  
If there's one thing I want you to do especially for me  
Then it's something that everybody needs  
  
Each night before you go to bed, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby,  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love.  
This is dedicated (to the one I love)  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated (to the one I love)  
This is dedicated

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years  
And the slow parade of fears without crying  
Now I want to understand  
  
I have done all that I could  
To see the evil and the good without hiding  
You must help me if you can  
  
Doctor, my eyes  
Tell me what is wrong  
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long  
  
'Cause I have wandered through this world  
And as each moment has unfurled  
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams  
People go just where they will  
I never noticed them until I got this feeling  
That it's later than it seems  
  
Doctor, my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
I hear their cries  
Just say if it's too late for me  
  
Is it too late  
Is it too late for me  
Tell me doctor  
Doctor, my eyes  
Cannot see the sky  
Is this the price for having learned how not to cry

Well its been building up inside of me  
For oh I don't know how long  
I don't know why  
But I keep thinking  
Something's bound to go wrong  
  
But she looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize  
And she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut  
When I started to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now because  
I pushed the other guys too far  
  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me wanna drive  
When she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
  
She told me "Baby, when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I loved you  
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"  
  
Oh what she does to me  
When she makes love to me  
And she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby

My friend's flesh and blood  
She lies overtime  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time  
I'm not that kind  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Night size, perfect ten  
So rude, she's no good  
But as she says  
It pays to win  
Play to win  
She plays to win  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Street wise for her time  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time

Fueled for Houston

The coffee may still be burning  
I'm in a yellow taxi racing down to LAX

I know there's pain  
Why do lock yourself up in these chains?  
No one can change your life except for you  
Don't ever let anyone step all over you  
Just open your heart and your mind  
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?  
  
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them

Things'll go your way  
Hold on for one more day  
  
You could sustain  
Or are you comfortable with the pain?  
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness  
You got yourself into your own mess  
Lettin' your worries pass you by  
Don't you think it's worth your time  
To change your mind?  
  
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry

But you hold on for one more day and  
Break free the chains  
Yeah I know that there is pain  
But you hold on for one more day and you  
Break free, break from the chains  
  
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them

Can't you change it this time  
  
Make up your mind  
Hold on

There's a world where I can go and tell my secrets to  
In my room, in my room  
In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears  
In my room, in my room  
  
Do my dreaming and my scheming  
Lie awake and pray  
Do my crying and my sighing  
Laugh at yesterday  
  
Now it's dark and I'm alone  
But I won't be afraid  
In my room, in my room  
In my room, in my room  
In my room, in my room

Hey, do you know what's going on  
Do you?

Are you aware of what surrounds you  
And all the times you tried to please everyone  
Can you admit it doesn't matter?  
Ooh there's never a dull moment in my life  
And I don't mind the ride  
Don't live a lifeless life  
When you could be living it right  
Don't be one to be led

Old man look at my life,  
I'm a lot like you were.  
  
Old man look at my life,  
Twenty four and there's so much more  
Live alone in a paradise  
That makes me think of two.  
  
Love lost, such a cost,  
Give me things that don't get lost.  
Like a coin that won't get tossed  
Rolling home to you.  
  
Old man take a look at my life I'm a lot like you  
I need someone to love me the whole day through  
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.  
  
Lullabies, look in your eyes,  
Run around the same old town.  
It doesn't mean that much to me  
To mean that much to you.  
  
I've been first and last  
Look at how the time goes past.  
But I'm all alone at last.  
Rolling home to you.  
Hey  
  
Old man take a look at my life I'm a lot like you  
I need someone to love me the whole day through  
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.

I know that it's time for a change  
Mmm but when that change comes  
Will you still feel the same?  
  
How many times have I tried to turn this love around?  
I don't want to give up  
But baby it's time I had two feet on the ground  
Can you release me  
Can you release me  
Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering  
Oh, if you'd have come down from your high  
Would we've been all right?  
Release me  
Can you release me  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
What is this power you've got on me  
What is this power, Oh  
What is it, What is it  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
Release me  
Will you release me  
Ah... Release me  
Will you release me

Not so long ago we were so in phase  
You and I could never forget the days  
But then the fire seemed to flicker  
Cold wind came and it carried us away  
But we'll get back someday, baby  
  
The dream is still alive  
Look here in my eyes  
Can you see what I'm feeling?  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
No I knew it would survive  
The dream is still alive  
  
Not so long ago in a purple haze  
People dreamed out loud they were not afraid  
They stopped the war but not the dying  
Some got a little bit lost along the way  
But somehow we're here today (And we say..)  
  
The dream is still alive  
After all this time  
The flame keeps on burning  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
No I knew it would survive  
The dream is, the dream is still alive  
  
Oh yeah..  
The dream is still alive  
Look here in my eyes  
Can you see what I'm feeling  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
For all the times we tried  
The dream is still alive  

Softly, love is standing here with its demands  
(Tell me what you want from me, you want from me)  
Slowly, I think I'm letting go of all my plans  
(Tell me where we're goin' to, we're goin' to)  
  
Why, why am I afraid to give into this  
Why am I afraid?  
  
[Chorus]  
This doesn't have to be love  
But it's all I can feel, it's all that I fear.  
This doesn't have to be anything at all,  
So hard to fall (from this high above)  
But do we have to call it love?  
  
I hold back, from everything I really want to say  
(Should I let my guards down, my guards down, my guards down)  
I don't, I don't make commitments that could break  
(Maybe it's just too late, it's just too late)  
  
I, I'm so afraid to give into this  
I'm so afraid, Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Need a little time to think things through, Baby  
Do I really want to give myself, give all myself to you, now?  
I can't believe it's happening so fast  
'Cause I don't want to bring back what I left in the past, No.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So hard to fall... in love  
This doesn't have to be... love  
(Love, love is all I feel... your love is what I fear)  
Love me... love me  
So hard to fall  
So very hard to fall.

I'm all grown up  
But somehow, it feels like I'm pretending  
Visions of my younger years, they are buried  
But the scenes that play inside of me, are impending  
They are never ending...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where, where, where, where, where are you?  
You don't have to look out that window, anymore.  
You can just come back to yourself, you can come back to this world.  
Where are you? Tell me who heard you. And where are you?  
  
He led me into his room, and had me lay down  
My heart, and my soul, and anything else that you could own,  
When you're six years old.  
But now I'm older  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Such a quiet secret, it hurt too much trying hard to keep it.  
Oh, and I looked up to you... I wanted so much to believe in you.  
I wanted so much for you to believe it me.  
Oh I tried, I tried.  
  
Where, where, where, where, where are you?  
You don't have to look out anymore.  
I don't have to look out of that window anymore.  
I can just, come back to myself, I can come back this world  
  
Where are you? Tell me who heard you? And where are you now?  
Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?  
Tell me who hurt you.

I wish I had all you ever wanted.  
I'd give it right to you.  
But I don't have it.  
How could I ever find it?  
The strength to let you go, 'cause I don't have it.  
When will I have it?  
And it goes and it goes on.  
And it goes on.  
  
You won't see me cry.  
You know I decided.  
that I'm gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it.  
I'm gonna have to hide it.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
  
I've got no choice but to face it.  
I have to let you know that I don't like it.  
My love is good for someone and it may take some time,  
but I will find him.  
Why should I waste it?  
When I go, (when I go)  
when I go on, I will go on.  
  
You won't see me cry.  
You know I decided.  
that I'm gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it.  
Oh no. Even if I have to hide it.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
  
You know I decided. That I'm gonna pull myself together  
I finally decided and I found the way to fight it.  
So you won't see me cry.

Feelin' better, now that we're through  
Feelin' better, 'cause I'm over you  
I learned my lesson, it left a scar  
Now I see how you really are  
  
[Chorus]  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
I'm gonna say it again  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
  
I broke her heart, it's gentle and true  
Yes I broke her heart, over someone like you  
I'll beg his forgiveness, on bended knee  
I wouldn't blame him, if he says to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Forget me, it's over)  
  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
  
Baby, oh baby, you're no good  
You're no good, you're no good  
  
[Choruse]  
  
I'm tellin' you now baby  
That I'm going my way  
Forget about you baby  
I'm on my way
