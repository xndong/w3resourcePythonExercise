I saw you in a way  
But that's another life  
Maybe they're the same  
I wonder where you are  
Yesterday is gone  
But it ain't far away  
I guess it's far enough  
  
I'm older in my head  
My innocents is gone  
I have the book you read  
To help me carry on  
What a price to pay  
To feel like you're alive  
I was blind when he said  
  
It's all the same  
No matter where you are x3  
He said  
But he was wrong  
  
I'm your jezebel  
On my way to hell  
What a price to pay  
To feel like you're alive  
She was blind  
When she said  
  
It's all the same  
No matter where you are x3  
She said  
But she was wrong

You're so impossible  
Scream and moan it chills my soul  
Don't want to hear you got left behind  
All those times you stayed up and cried  
It's no lie  
You did it to yourself  
Like chewed up gum under my shelf  
Don't look surprised  
You must have know all along  
  
It's just another love song  
Another love song  
  
It's never easy  
It's not hard  
When you've lost your mind  
With you it's sleezy  
Don't tell me your worries  
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind  
Now the time has come  
To leave this love that's left you dry  
No need to work this out now  
Cause you know there's no reason why  
  
It's just another love song  
Another love song  
  
I never told you it would last forever  
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it  
By the time you read my letter  
Baby, I'll be gone  
  
You're just another love song  
Another love song

Silent hell on the marble slab  
The best trip that I've ever had  
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around  
My drinks on empty, need another round  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to fly, want to ride with you  
Is this the best that you can do?  
I want to fly, want to ride with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere  
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times  
I never seen you before  
But now that I have, I don't want to see you no more  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control  
Ah-ah, ah  
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control  
Ah-ah, ah  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
[Chorus]

I see you go  
Through a park in a haze  
And I don't listen  
For traffic going the same way  
A simple system, yeah  
I string 'em up  
I cut 'em down  
Dare I say  
  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
  
A perfect vision  
Some simple ways to let you know  
Free range humans all cooped up  
Naked clone is playing lame, yeah  
I string 'em up  
I cut 'em down  
Dare I say  
  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to  
To to to to to

Make you into dark  
Straight into your heart  
Sorry all you are  
I don't really care  
Well, I know you are...  
  
Robots, robots  
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech  
Spoken rabies  
Spastic, plastic, battery acid  
Yank on the leash  
Draggin' you backwards  
Oh, my closed eyes  
Never see it comin'  
  
There's nothing you can say  
You can't wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist you'll never learn  
Battery acid, battery acid  
  
Battery acid in my veins  
Unidentified remains  
"Yes" button broke to automatic  
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are  
You were  
  
(Jealous)  
To feel the way you do  
(To mention)  
A lie, then call it true  
(Feel for)  
Nothing except for yourself and nobody else  
Hanging over the edge  
  
There's nothing you can say  
You can't wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist you'll never learn  
In battery acid, battery acid, hey

The blue pill opens your eyes  
Is there a better way  
A new religion prescribed  
To those without the faith  
The hero holding a knife  
And blood is not enough  
Is it too late to go back?  
Is it too late to go?  
  
There's no one here  
And people everywhere, you're on your own  
  
Let's see if I'm hearing this right  
Is it just I should take  
And never endings are glad  
To carry out the dead  
Your idols burn in the fire  
The mob comes crawling out (take us down and out)  
I'm reclaiming their minds  
Destroying everyone  
  
There's no one here  
And people everywhere, you're all alone

No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around  
Christian Brothers going to take him down  
But it can't help me get over  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man  
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand  
Well, I know how much you care  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Come here by me, I want you here  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

I fall over and over and over over over on you  
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill, you're the only one I'm into  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
I go lower and lower and lower lower livin easy  
I don't know, I don't know what I got till it's over  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
  
Can you do it again  
Do it again  
Do it again  
Can you do it again  
  
All the way, all the way, all the way, there's no where left we can meet  
I'm into what you do but I leave you no where  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
All we need  
Is one more time  
  
Can you do it again  
Do it again  
Do it again  
Can you do it again  
  
I only get to live one life  
I won't pretend you're only mine  
Where will you go, where will you find the way  
  
To do it again  
Do it again

I play a game 'til I'm dead  
Or on a magazine  
I wanna look like I'm dead  
Dancing on a string  
I eat the food when it's there  
Make a mess of things  
Get that look everywhere  
But keep that look off my face  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
There's no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
From a crumbling tower I see everything  
London, Tokyo, New York City  
There's no love any place  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
There's no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition  
Over, over left with who we are  
Did you tell anyone?  
Did you tell any place?  
  
Everybody else wanna fall in love  
There's no room for love in a modern sky  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
Living in the era vulgaris  
Just drool in the dark  
As you stare at the lights  
  
Just stare at the lights

You want to know why you feel so hollow?  
Because you are.  
You're missing out? Well if you say so  
Then you're missing out  
  
Everybody knows that you are insane  
You want to know just how long you can hide from what you are?  
Not very long  
I have been lost. Down every road I follow out in the dark  
On my way home  
  
But I feel nothing. Am I better yet?  
  
Everybody knows that you are insane

Well I know, I know  
I know that everybody,  
I know that everybody be happy,  
Happy as you and me,  
Cos I know, I know,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want say,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want to say,  
Everybody gonna be happy,  
Which means you and me my love,  
Everybody gonna be happy,  
Which means you and me my love,  
Oh-oh-oh  
When I see you walking down the street,  
Well it makes me happy to see you walking,  
Makes my life complete,  
And I know, I know,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want to say,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want to say,  
Everybody gonna be happy,  
Which means you and me my love,  
Everybody gonna be happy,  
Which means you and me my love,  
Oh, I know,  
I know that you and me,  
I know that you and me be happy,  
Happy as we can be.  
Cos I know, I know,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want to say,  
Come on baby, let me tell you,  
All the things I want to say,  
Everybody gonna be happy which means you and me my love (x4)  
Oh-oh-oh (to fade)

Is there anyone out there?  
Or am I walking alone?  
When I turned around and found that you'd gone before  
The first rain could fall  
  
It seems every single time I was bleeding  
Broken promises that never came true  
Well it ain't so long before the dawn  
When the sun is gone so are  
Well, so are you  
  
So what's it gonna take  
To get you back in bed?  
Gossip, drugs, and snakes  
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
Fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
  
One day when we're far away  
From everything that hurts  
Drink and screw is all we'll do  
Every day  
  
So what's it gonna take  
To get you back in bed?  
Gossip, drugs, and snakes  
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
  
And though the hour's late  
Don't let 'em in your head (fair weather friends)  
Gonna pray for rain again and again  
Fair weather friends  
Fair weather friends  
  
Fair I don't give a shit about 'em anyhow

I'm in you  
You're in me  
I can't tell  
  
You're so cruel  
More than me  
It is true  
That's right  
  
Loyal to  
Only you  
Up your sleeve  
  
I want some (come on, take it)  
Of all of you (it's yours)  
Trickin' me  
  
First it give'th  
Then it take'th away  
  
I would beg  
I would plead  
I would shake  
  
On a hook  
Dangling  
By the way  
  
I'm so young  
And beautiful  
(That's right)  
(I'm slick)  
I'm no fool  
  
Time goes by  
Tables turn  
Now I know  
  
First it give'th  
Then it take'th away

She said "I'll throw myself away,  
They're just photos after all"  
I can't make you hang around.  
I can't wash you off my skin.  
Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out  
You won't remember anyway  
I can go with the flow  
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head?  
It's so safe to play along  
Little soldiers in a row  
Falling in and out of love  
With something sweet to throw away.  
But I want something good to die for  
To make it beautiful to live.  
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate.  
Do you believe it in your head?  
I can go with the flow  
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head?

I thought I saw him on the video  
A trance is keeping him under  
I know that god is in the radio  
Checkin' the station  
I'm glad I caught it from me to you  
Just a call in the medium  
I know you hear it, I hear it too  
It's everywhere that I go  
  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
  
The say the devil is paranoid  
Always signin' the cover  
But god is leakin' through the stereo  
Between the station to station  
You believe it, I know you do  
You won't admit it or say so  
I know that god is in the radio  
Just repeating a slogan  
  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong

Wait by the phone  
Late alone  
He can't help you  
But I know I could  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in, break it off  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I'm gonna leave you  
  
I gave it starts  
I stomped on your hearts  
This the is the end,  
No more pictures, we ain't friends  
It's raining in my room  
There's blood in my spoon  
You're out of my highchair  
I'm out of your womb  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I'm gonna leave you  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in, push it in, break it off  
  
I'm gonna leave  
Gonna leave you  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I don't need you

Too late to think or filter anymore  
A bitter pill to swallow  
Maybe you're in a blanket haze of ephedrine  
I'm wonderin' where the hell you been  
So come on and right this wrong, the rope  
  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
'Cause devils and ropes around your neck  
Cursing them all  
And you can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
  
Ain't got a mind to deal with anymore  
Saboteur, infiltrator, and maybe more  
If you're not blind and deaf, how can we pollute your head?  
So come on and right this wrong, the rope  
  
And I got it all right  
I got a feeling  
You'd rather open up your wrist, and let it go  
I got it all right, yeah  
I got a feeling  
'Cause devils and ropes around my neck can't even know  
'Cause they can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
Can't hear it

Calling all comas,  
Prisoner on the loose  
Description:  
A spitting image of me  
Except for a heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Prison of sleep  
Deepened now  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
Again  
  
Where are you hiding, my love?  
Cast off like a stone  
Feelings, raw and exposed when I'm out of control  
Pieces were stolen from me  
But dare I say, given away  
Watching the water give in  
As I go down the drain  
I appear missing now  
  
I go missing,  
No longer exist  
One day I hope  
I'm someone you'd met  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Deeper I sleep  
Further down  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
  
It's only falling in love  
Because you hit the ground  
  
Dancing on wire both ends are on fire  
Cut me loose  
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend  
Wandering along the road in the summer night  
  
I go missing,  
No longer exist  
One day I hope  
I'm someone you'd met  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Deeper I sleep  
Further down  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
  
Don't cry  
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
Inside  
I'm over the edge, what can I do?  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
  
Don't cry  
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
Inside  
I'm over the edge, what can I do?  
Inside  
  
I've fallen through

I sat by the ocean  
And drank a potion, baby to erase you  
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldn't face you  
  
There ain't no use in cryin'  
It doesn't change anything, so baby what good does it do?  
Your friends they'll sympathize, maybe I don't need them to  
  
Imagine I'd be your one and only  
Instead I'm the lonely one  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
  
There's nowhere to run away  
Said, 'Boy if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new'  
'Do you know who you really are? Are you sure it's really you'?  
Lies are a funny thing  
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you  
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view  
  
Imagine I'd be your one and only  
Instead I'm the lonely one  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide  
  
Closer and closer  
We're crashing ships in the night

You know why  
They called and just let it ring  
No reply  
The door is open I swear  
Ain't no use in pickin' up  
You know why  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all my head I know  
So they tell me so  
Until my head explodes  
Into my head it goes  
  
Tastes so good  
Oh, but I knew it would  
Tastes so good  
Burn like a match house  
Medicate just to make you soft  
Love is blind  
  
Catchin' the rest me  
What the hell were they thinking of  
You know why  
  
[Chorus]

Gitchy, gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da do run run  
You won't get far  
  
I'm machine  
I'm obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Lobotomy  
  
I wanna suck, I wanna lick  
I want to cry and I want to spit  
Tears of pleasure  
Tears of pain  
They trickle down your face the same  
  
It's how you look  
Not how you feel  
A city of glass  
With no heart  
  
If I had a tail  
I'd own the night  
If I had a tail  
I'd swat the flies  
  
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
Gitchy, gitchy  
Ooh la la  
Da doo ron ron  
It won't get far  
  
Animals in  
The midnight zone  
When you own the world  
You're always home  
  
Get your hands dirty  
Roll up them sleeves  
Brainwashed or true believers?  
Buy flash cars  
Diamond rings  
Expensive holes to bury things  
  
I'm machine  
I'm obsolete  
In the land of the free  
Immortality  
  
If I had a tail  
I'd own the place  
If I had a tail  
I'd swat the flies  
  
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
See me dancing on the stars  
See me dance  
  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night  
If I have a tail  
I will control the night

If it gets you down well then I'll take it  
If it gets you up well I don't want it  
It let you down so broken-hearted  
If it gets you down well then I want it  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all  
  
So blow our mind and make it lazy  
Those long, long days with no escaping  
I hold the wheel to let it go  
Don't want to stop, don't want to know  
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all

My generation's for sale  
Beats a steady job  
How much have you got?  
  
My generation don't trust no one  
It's hard to blame  
Not even ourselves  
  
The thing that's real for us is: fortune and fame  
All the rest seems like work  
It's just like diamonds  
In shit  
  
I'm high class, I'm a whore  
Actually both  
Basically, I'm a pro  
We've all got our own style of baggage  
Why hump it yourself?  
  
You've made me an offer that I can refuse  
'Cause either way I get screwed  
Counter proposal: I go home and jerk off, uh  
  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own, you don't own  
You don't own what none can buy  
You don't own  
(You don't own)  
Neither do I  
  
High and mighty, you say selling out is a shame  
Is that the name of your book?  
Push a silver spoon in your ass  
No more holding us  
Down, dog, down, mutt, nice mutt  
  
You're insulted you can't be bought or sold  
Translation: offer too low  
You don't know what you're worth  
It isn't much  
My piano's for sale  
How many times must I sell myself  
Before my pieces are gone?  
I'm one of a kind! I'm designer!  
  
Never again will I repeat myself  
Enough is never enough  
Never again will I repeat myself  
  
It used to be the plan was screwing the man  
Now it's have sex with a man  
(After he buys your dot-com for sale at a low, low price)  
  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own me  
You don't own what none can buy  
You don't own...  
You don't own what none can buy  
Neither do I

It's the cruelest joke to play  
I'm so high I run in place  
Only a line we separate  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep on playing our favorite song  
I turn it up while you're gone  
It's all I've got when you're in my head  
And you're in my head, so I need it  
  
You're the only thing I've got  
I can't seem to get enough  
We collide for one embrace  
So  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Ooh, ohh  
  
Hurry up and wait forever  
Hurry up and wait forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need it  
I need it  
I need it now

Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the heart  
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow  
Way down low, I never do you any good  
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could  
  
Ain't gonna run  
Just live till you die, want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
There's nothing to save I know  
You live till you die  
  
Live till you die, I know  
  
Loosing feelin', but I couldn't get the way ?  
Countin' and breathin', disappearin' in the fade  
Lay down low, I never do you any good  
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could  
  
Ain't gonna run  
Just live till you die, want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
There's nothing to save I know  
You live till you die

Got a hole in my head  
Everything falls right out  
Through my ears, through my eyes  
Makes no difference where you are  
You wanna know how I do it?  
I do it all right  
You wanna know how I do it  
I do it all right  
I got a hole and I'll never go home  
There ain't nothing can fill it up  
I got a hole and I'll never go home  
There ain't no one thing  
A new road, a new road  
A new road, a new road  
You never get right back  
A new road  
You never get it right back  
A new road  
You wanna know how I do it?  
You wanna know how I do it  
You wanna know how I do it  
I do it all right  
I gotta hole and I'll never go home  
There ain't nothing that can fill it up  
I gotta hole and I'll never go home  
There ain't no one thing out there  
Not me with a gun to my head  
I can let it go  
Not me with a gun to my head  
I can let it go  
So I sing  
  

Avoir, adieu, goodnight  
I'm too wrong to get right  
But I can't wait forever  
I've always been alone  
A fool believes he's clever  
  
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?  
I won't go alone  
Aren't you gonna follow?  
  
I live behind my eyes  
Be sure to keep the surprise  
I break what I've, I've borrowed  
That's why I always go  
Alone into tomorrow  
  
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?  
I won't go alone  
Aren't you gonna follow?  
  
Into the hollow  
Into the hollow

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the night sky they blast  
Through the universe the engines whine  
Could it be the end of man and time  
Back on earth the flame of life burns low  
Everywhere is misery and woe  
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea  
Man prepares to meet his destiny  
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the night sky so vast  
Burning metal through the atmosphere  
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear  
With the hateful battles raging on  
rockets flying to the glowing sun  
Through the empires of eternal void  
Freedom from the final suicide  
  
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun  
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.  
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate  
find another world where freedom waits.  
Past the stars in fields of ancient void  
Through the shields of darkness where they find  
Love upon a land a world unknown  
where the sons of freedom make their home  
  
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves  
leave them to their future in the grave  
Make a home where love is there to stay

I never lie  
To myself  
Tonight.  
  
Rose, tinted eyes  
Color my sorrow  
A shade of white  
  
Bye bye black balloon  
See you real soon  
Wave bye bye  
Bye bye  
  
Why were you so sad  
What have they done?  
Forget those mindless baboons  
They're off playing God  
  
Copy cats in cheap suits  
All playing it safe  
While cannibals with their noose  
Consume a parade  
  
Is it wonderful?  
  
Kalopsia, kalopsia, kalopsia  
Kalopsia, kalopsia  
  
Far, far from shore  
The land of nightmares  
Gone forever more  
  
And I love you more  
Than I can control  
I don't even try  
Why would I?  
  
Oh why the long face?  
You've got it all wrong  
Forget the rat in the race  
We'll choke chain them all  
  
Fates favor the ones  
Who help themselves  
The rest feel the sting of the lash  
As they run, as they row  
The boat to hell  
Row

Hey, sister, are you all alone?  
I'm standing out your window  
Hey, little sister, can I come inside you?  
I want to show you all my love  
I want to be the only one  
I know you like nobody ever, baby  
  
Little sister, can't you find another way?  
No more living life behind a shadow  
  
You whisper secrets in my ear  
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek  
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby  
They say I'll only do you wrong  
Come together 'cause I understand  
Just who you really are, yeah, baby  
  
Little sister, can't you find another way?  
No more living life behind a shadow

You wanna know if I know why  
I can't say that I do  
Don't understand the you or I  
Or how one becomes two  
I just can't recall what started it off  
Or how to begin again  
I ain't here to break ya  
Just see how far it will bend  
Again and again, again and again  
  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Anytime, anywhere  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
  
Sometimes the same is different  
But mostly it's the same  
These mysteries of life...  
That just ain't my thing  
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue  
The only thing I know for sure  
Is what I won't do  
Anytime, anywhere, and I said...  
  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Anytime, anywhere  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Anytime, anywhere)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Yeah  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Anytime, anywhere)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
(Again and again, and again, and again)  
I wanna make it

Dead blow with the life from the low  
I'll be massive conquistador  
Give me sword, show me the door  
Metal heavy, shocked at the core  
Gimme toro, gimme some more  
  
Pressurize, neutralize  
Deep fried, gimme some more  
  
Space flunky, four on the floor  
Fortified with the liquor store  
This one's down, gimme some more  
Gimme toro, gimme some more  
Gimme toro, gimme some more  
Gimme toro, gimme some more  
  
Shrunken head I love to adore  
B-movie, gimme some gore  
Gimme toro, gimme some more  
B-movie, gimme some gore  
  
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Wanna see my passin' flames?  
Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't first  
Where I was born, no escape  
There ain't even no good bad drugs  
In the city, is it true?  
If you don't, you act like you do  
Feast of fools, I can't wait  
Give 'em a taste of my misfit love  
  
Complicate  
Incarcerate  
Feel my heart wake up?  
  
Ain't born to lose, baby  
I'm born to win  
I'm so goddamn sick, baby, it's a sin  
It's a sin  
  
Transforming is becoming...  
Transforming is becoming on me  
  
Do me first, do your worst  
Gimme what I want some of  
One-track mind, no time to waste  
  
Sidewalks, feel me strut so good  
Gutter, don't forget this face  
Let 'em taste my misfit love  
I'll show you all my dirty tricks  
Then show 'em again I'm so proud of 'em  
It's cruel to be constantly  
Feel my heart play dumb  
  
Ain't born to lose, baby  
I'm born to win  
I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin  
It's a sin  
  
Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night  
And if you're going anywhere tonight...  
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night  
And if you are going, can I get a ride?  
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night  
It's impossible to wait until the light  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won

The walls are closing in again, oh well  
The walls are closing in again, oh well  
I seen some thing I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well  
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well  
And my mind is out here on another wave  
Covered in hair  
  
She won't grow  
  
[Chorus]  
You've got a monster (distress) in your parasol (body out??)  
You've got a monster (dwarfs, doors?) in your parasol (of course)  
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol (I told you??)  
You've got a monster ? in your parasol (x-nay?)  
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well  
  
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well  
I seen some things I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
  
She won't grow  
  
You've got a monster (distress, my pest?) in your parasol  
You've got a monster (dwarfs) in your parasol (war horse)  
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol ?  
You've got a hole in you I never saw ?  
In your parasol, in your parasol

The astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
The fabric of the universe  
Out of which this earth is woven  
The moon is a mirror alike  
She returns my loving  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
The astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Maybe it won't be that far  
It won't be long before we're getting  
To enjoy this setting  
  
We're getting closer to where we're heading  
We've been chosen  
To enjoy this setting  
  
That astral map that's overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
Into fata morgana's I melt  
Onto the buckle of orion's belt

If time itself was his demeanor  
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer  
Of sunlight landi' on the street  
Sunsuit girls must be discreet  
Sunsuit girls must be discreet  
Nursing their fathers locked inside  
They masqueraded as his bride  
  
I might like you better  
If we slept together  
But there's somethin'  
In your eyes that says  
Maybe that's never  
Never say never  
  
The slump by the courthouse  
With windburn skin  
That man could give a fuck  
About the grin on your face  
As you walk by, randy as a goat  
He's sleepin' on papers  
When he'd be warm in your coat  
  
I might like you better  
If we slept together  
But there's somethin'  
In your eyes that says  
Maybe that's never  
Never say never  
  
There's no easy way to lose your sight  
On the street, on the stairs  
Who's on your flight  
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin  
But he's got her and she's got him  
  
Never say never

We get some rules to follow  
That and this  
These and those  
No one knows  
  
We get these pills to swallow  
How they stick  
In your throat  
Tastes like gold  
  
Oh, what you do to me  
No one knows  
  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
Ah  
  
I journey through the desert  
Of the mind  
With no hope  
I found low  
  
I drift along the ocean  
Dead lifeboats in the sun  
And come undone  
  
Pleasantly caving in  
I come undone  
  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool I  
Ah  
  
Heaven smiles above me  
What a gift her below  
But no one knows  
  
A gift that you give to me  
No one knows

Ridin' top the floodway on a Friday night,  
The landscape's a fine and nat'ral sight.  
Just cruisin' slow through the dark of night.  
With Precious and Grace ev'rything's all right.  
  
Good God Almighty, we was goin' down slow,  
Yeah, if we knew just where we had to go.  
Cryin', just a flyin' down a put out road  
With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford.  
  
So if you're out rollin' late some night,  
Yeah, and you need that supernatural delight, I'm talkin' to you, brother,  
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight.  
Get with Precious and Grace, they gonna treat you right.

I don't even know what I'm doin' here  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
Oh  
  
A little girl, can never see  
Awkward, stumbling, gotta be with me  
I know, you know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby baby yes I swear  
Who  
  
Blamin' this heart  
With a lesson to be borne  
I'm so old, you're so young!  
  
I know, you know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear  
Goddamn it  
Whoa  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
Little girl  
Listen to what I say  
  
You know, I know  
Everybody, everyone, let's go!  
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear  
Who  
Ah ah oh baby baby yes I swear  
Goddamn it  
Whoa

Who are you girl?  
Who are you boy?  
Bet I know what you're up to  
Can I come along  
Your home number's on the wall  
I just had to call, had to  
I'm not the only one  
Who will run with a knife  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
Where's your daddy now  
I heard he ran away  
Who are you girl?  
  
'Cause I'm so bored with myself  
Anyway  
Any time and any place  
I'll just hang around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
Open up your door  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room

Fast approaching monsters marching in a row  
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold  
Run, darling, run  
I'll stall them if I can  
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine  
  
Run, darling, run  
I'll stall if I can  
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine  
Avert the children's eyes  
Forgets left untold  
Don't look back to see  
The blood river in the road  
  
Get sweet revenge with my blood river in the road

When I was young, we used to play the game called hide and seek  
Someone'd go hide, I'd count to ten  
You probably never played, instead you talked a game of sheep  
A skill you almost do perfect  
  
Run, pig, run  
Here I come  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
  
I am no saint and make no claims to being in the right  
It's just for now, I am wrong less  
You're probably wondering with what to do this has with you  
I wanna play the game you missed  
  
Run, pig, run  
Here I come  
  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place to hide  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run  
Woo, hoo, hoo, run

[UK Bonus Track]  
  
When I was a little boy,  
I looked under the stairs,  
The King and the Pawns  
Were caught unawares,  
Standing in the shadows  
A whisperer to be,  
Just fishing in the darkness  
Of possibilities.  
  
Just look at you now  
Yeah  
Look at you now  
Yeah  
Oh  
Look at you now  
  
Among such style and grace  
Our highest hopes,  
None standing  
Still the running joke,  
Where goes the warm embrace  
It fades without return  
It lives to slip through fingertips and burn.  
  
Just look at you now  
Oh  
Look at you now  
Ohh  
look at you now  
Ohh  
Look at you now

Young, dumb, don't see a problem  
Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum  
Simple as this: I'm in love with the risk  
I know what I've done, but tell me, what did I miss?  
So please, don't save something, waste not, save nothing  
Lose the halo, don't need to resist  
A lick of the lips and a grip on your hips  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
  
First thing we succumb to  
Shout, erase, and undo  
Days are unreleased if there's no release  
Please just let me do whatever fits you  
Make something, make someone  
Beg on a knee, baby, baby, please  
Pout your bottom lip  
While cracking the whip  
You know what we want  
It's candy to cum to  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
  
A total eclipse in the teeth of the risk  
The tongue is a twist  
Perpetual bliss  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever...  
  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick, sick, sick  
Don't resist  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)  
  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)  
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)  
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)  
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

It's all in motion  
No stoppin' now  
I've got nothin' to lose  
And only one way up  
  
I'm burning bridges  
I destroy the mirage  
Oh, visions of collisions  
Fuckin 'bon voyage  
  
It's all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
  
I got bruises and hickies  
Stitches and scars  
Got my own theme music  
It plays wherever I are  
  
Fear is the hand  
That pulls your strings  
A useless toy  
Pitiful plaything  
  
I'm inflagranti  
In every way  
  
It's all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
I'm gon' do the damage  
That needs gettin' done  
  
God only knows  
Where love vacations  
If reason is priceless  
There's no reason to pay for it  
  
It's so easy to see  
And so hard to find  
Make a mountain of a mole hill  
If the mole hill is mine  
  
I hypnotize you  
And no one can find you  
I blow my load  
Over the status quo  
Here we go  
  
I'm a little bit nonchalant  
But I dance  
I'm risking it always  
No second chance  
  
It's gonna be smooth sailing  
From here on out  
I'm gon' do the damage  
'Til the damage is done yeah  
  
God only knows  
So mind your behavior  
Follow prescriptions  
Of your lord and savior  
  
Every temple is gold  
Every hook is designed  
Hell is but the temple  
Of the closed mind  
Closed mind  
Closed mind  
Closed mind  
  
It's all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
  
Shut up  
  
Pow!

A song for the deaf, that is for you  
  
Nobody's comin' down the hall  
Everybody echoes in my head  
Broken reflection outta luck  
Nobody ever needed it  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
I'm ready now  
  
Beautiful senses are gone  
Canary in a gilded cage  
Singing  
  
Sweet soft and low  
I will poison you all  
Come closer racing to your tongue  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
No talk will cure, what's lost or save  
What's left, for the deaf  
  
The blind can go get fucked  
Lie beside the ditch  
This halo round my neck  
Has torn out every stitch  
  
Who are you hidin'?  
Is it safe for the deaf?  
Beautiful, cancer  
Infiltrate, and forget  
  
Then I saw you comin'  
Then I heard not a thing  
A mistake not to listen  
When I knew where you'd been?  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
No talk will cure, what's lost or save  
What's left, for the deaf  
  
You're listening to W. A. N. T  
The high desert favorite [Incomprehensible] radio station  
It's been a good night, Dave catching here  
Not saying goodnight, just saying

Every day I wake up,  
Feeling this way.  
I take it down town  
With all the action going down  
I strike a match,  
Strike a match.  
Work it up!  
  
I'm feeling so sick  
I feel so fucking sick  
On the bathroom floor  
Gotta get out and get right  
Hustling little girls  
Cheating little boys,yeah  
Gotta get out, gotta get out  
Get right  
Gotta get out  
I gotta get out  
No more  
No more  
No more  
  
I'm feelin' so sick  
On the bathroom floor  
I'm feelin' so sick  
No more  
  
Yeah  
  
I'm feelin' so sick  
Sick  
On the bathroom floor  
Sick  
No no more

Here comes the one that you've been dreaming of  
I am the most exalted potentate of love  
I got a mojo hand that fits like a glove  
I'll be coming round the mountain to get your love  
I'm the most exalted potentate of love  
Yes I am  
Yes, I'm the celebrated hottentot of twat  
Make a hole, look out, make way for a demon child  
I'll make you hear my turtle dove  
Ride around the range to get your love  
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun  
Mad, you called me mad?  
I have the secret to eternal love  
Mad, you call me mad?  
I am the most exalted potentate of love  
Yes, I'll teach you how to read the book of life  
You can just look at the pictures if you like  
I'll make you hear my turtle dove  
Ride around the range to get your love  
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun  
I am the most exalted potentate of love

The sky is falling  
Human race that we run  
It left me crawling  
Staring straight at the sun  
Only a moment I notice  
Every dog has his day  
I paid attention  
Cost me so much to today  
  
For so long  
I saw only wrong  
But now to remind  
It's a waste of time  
  
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling  
  
I wanted something  
Nothing blank I don't know  
It's all deflecting  
Stones are easy to throw  
Only a moment I notice  
Hours, days left behind  
Of wasted, useless  
Selfless, none of a kind  
  
For so long  
I saw only wrong  
But now to remind  
Not to go back to the low  
That has drained my life so low  
That has drained my life so low  
That has drained my life so low  
  
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I want God to come and take me home  
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd  
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?  
Not exactly sure anymore  
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?  
Or just follow you for a while?  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
I feel no love  
  
Ain't no confusion here, it is as I feared  
The illusion that you feel is real  
To be vulnerable is needed most of all  
If you intend to truly fall apart  
  
You think the worst of all is far behind  
The vampire of time and memories has died  
I survived. I speak, I breathe,  
I'm incomplete  
I'm alive - hooray!  
You're wrong again  
'Cause I feel no love  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
I feel no love, I feel no love

Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartache?  
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade?  
All your affections finally fade away  
There will be no use inside  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
One day you'll find out when I'm gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for you?  
  
One day you'll find out when I'm gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Who'll be the next in line?  
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?  
There will be no use inside  
Who will next in line for you?  
  
For you, for you, for you  
For you, for you, for you  
For you

Me just happy robot  
Live on hill of beans  
You and I cut from same cloth  
Rippin' at the seams  
Cut, snip, cut  
  
Don't forget to remember  
The devil's got pills in his eyes  
Look, laugh, but don't touch  
Cut you down to size  
Cut, up, cut (shut up)  
Cut, up, cut  
  
You would know  
  
My girl's all out of focus  
I ain't no big surprise  
Daddy got his gun loaded  
Got cross hairs in his eyes  
Shut up, oh  
Shut up, oh  
  
You would know  
  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know
