In spite of all the consequence  
In spite of all my pride  
In spite of little things you said  
That hide me deep inside  
  
I believe your love  
I breathe your love  
Like the air in the morning  
I sleep your love  
I salute your love  
And I can't get away  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
The lights of all you see  
You could have overcome all this  
And I still can't get over you  
Are you someone I'll forever miss  
I believed your love I can feel your love  
And that's all that I wanted  
I sleep your love I salute your love  
And I can't get away  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
And there's the dark, begins to rain  
The sound is heavy on me  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Under the spell I wanna be under your touch  
Under the spell I wanna be under the rush  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you

[Sia:]  
I was bound, was tired  
Hadn't seen a light so long  
Thought I lost my fight  
Couldn't find my way back home  
And I found the light stepping out of me  
I was bound, and tired  
Waiting for daylight  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed  
I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead I rose above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you think you're giving up  
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't  
And you feel the love stepping out of you  
But when you think of giving up, don't  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang your head up against the wall  
You may feel light headed, but you won't crawl, no, you won't fall  
You will rise above it all  
You'll find what you're searching for  
And you may feel light headed  
You think you're gonna hit the floor  
Instead you rise above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang your head against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead you rise above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Bridge:]  
I have broken wings  
I keep trying, keep trying  
No one get out  
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed, I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head against the wall  
Bang my head against the wall  
Instead I rise above it all

(Feat Niles Mason)  
  
In the big city, chasing big dreams,  
Seems like the spot lights out of reach.  
When will they notice?  
Why they don't hear?  
Why won't you listen to my melody?  
One day I will be a star  
Living life on a high  
My name on a mark big enough to see from Mars!  
  
Chorus:  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
  
Paparazzi all around me, pictures in every magazine  
... rumors, commercial consumers,...  
This is the reality of a star...  
My name on mark big enough to see from Mars  
  
Chorus:  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody know me!  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!

Colours will change  
I love every shade of you  
Don't lose your faith  
Keep walking out you do  
Don't you say that wasn't worth  
All the pain and all the hurt you're going through  
(And) I'll always be with you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No, this is not the end  
Just go your way  
Somewhere we'll meet again  
Hold on to the moments we shared  
Those are the chances that once you'll be back  
Goodbye friend  
  
The world's just a place  
That we're only passing through  
Heaven awaits  
Those that keep marching through  
Don't you say that loving lost  
Wasn't worth the pain it cost you're going through  
Cause I'd take it all for you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No, this is not the end  
Lift up your head  
Somewhere with me again  
Or until the moments be shared  
Those are the treasures that won't disappear  
Goodbye friend  
Friend, friend, friend, friend

In love with myself  
In love with my own reflection  
With my own affection  
With the vision that i see  
  
There's nobody else  
I'm taking my own direction  
I can see perfection  
Doing all i can for me  
  
In love with myself...  
  
I can take you to hell  
I'm falling so deep inside it  
And i just can't hide it  
Feel it burning down on me  
  
I dance with myself  
As hundreds of eyes are waiting  
Can't strip completely  
And the lights are burning me  
  
In love with myself...  
  
Tonight I'm gonna meet somebody  
After all the lights have died  
I'm still living,  
But what am i giving?

Doing all i can for me

After all the lights have died

There's no way we can try off without struggle  
I'm just like you  
Are you trying to bring me down

Just like you I am trying to make it home  
I dream at night of a better day  
You and I, in a better place

Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Inside a song, there's a hero to discover  
There's no way we can try off without struggle  
I'm just like you  
Are you trying to bring me down  
  
I'm just like you  
Help me turn this thing around

Can't hear you baby  
Hey hey what you say?  
Say I am a... Vision  
Every time something plays  
Our system go switch  
Tone I am an over grad  
I ain't thinking of listening no  
You think you are saying a spot  
But it's all in your brain  
I think I'm... Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Music is got me on my love this night  
All I can do is keep on dancing  
He got me good now it controls me  
Like a machine  
(Repeat)  
  
... About the dollar bills bills in your pocket  
I ain't tripping it down till the sun is out  
And I am gonna go hard till the floor breaks  
I am coming through I am the...  
You think you are saying a spot  
But it's all in your brain  
I think I'm... Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel it taking over me  
The music is all I see  
I can't stop  
What it does to me  
Gonna keep on dancing  
Dancing dancing (repeat)  
  
Chorus

Let's hit the road and away we go  
Take a new direction to a different post  
Maybe we should try and put it on the line  
You've gotta trust me now, turn up the radio  
Tune out the world and roll with the melody  
Baby, listen close and open up your mind  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Soundtrack in the wind, like classic violins  
I can be your rhythm in the silence  
And every time we sing, it echoes in the sky  
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize  
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night  
Listen to the words as I let 'em fly  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

I can hear your thoughts  
Like footsteps in the dark  
The pain stirs in your voice  
Cuts like daggers to my heart  
  
Don't you be afraid  
Baby I'm here  
Stop running from love  
Baby don't you fear  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Play the simple game  
With all your broken rules  
I'm calling out your name  
But my heart just still refuses  
  
Don't you be afraid  
Baby I'm here  
Stop running from love  
Baby don't you fear  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words  
  
Cause it's louder  
So much louder than words  
Baby it's louder  
So much louder than words

After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?

No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
  
Now that the love is gone, what felt so right's so wrong  
Now that the love is gone

Let's light it up, let's light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world, a burning light  
They've never shined so bright  
We'll find a way, we'll find a way  
To keep the cold night  
From breaking in over the walls  
Into the wild side  
The hunger satisfies  
  
We're burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
  
We'll never know, we'll never know  
What stands behind the North  
But I got a feeling  
It's a feeling that's we're dying for  
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath  
Because it feels right  
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side  
And let's enjoy the ride  
  
We're burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
  
Let's light it up, let's light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world, a burning light  
They've never shined so bright

People come and people go  
But your touch cuts me deeper  
And still it grows at the center  
I will always remember  
  
Years gone by  
Seems like you're still here  
Every night in my dreams  
You remind me with kisses so tender  
I will always remember  
  
Never been one to give my heart up so easily  
But now you're gone wish I'd given my heart completely  
In the touch of a stranger I can feel you  
In the eyes of a child I see your face  
  
Your hold on my soul  
Keeps me from danger  
No matter how hard I try  
These memories I can't erase  
  
People come and people go  
But your touch cuts me deeper  
And still it grows at the center  
I will always remember  
  
Years gone by  
Seems like you're still here  
Every night in my dreams  
You remind me with kisses so tender  
I will always remember  
  
In the brush of a stranger I can feel you  
In the eyes of a child I see your face  
Your hold on my soul  
Keeps me from danger  
  
No matter how hard I try  
These memories I can't replace.

We rode on horses made of sticks  
He wore black and I wore white  
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, I hit the ground  
Bang bang, that awful sound  
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Big Snoop Dogg  
Can you be my doctor?  
Can you fix me up?  
Can you wipe me down?  
So I can make you give it up give it up  
Until you say my name  
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game  
Be my head coach  
So you can...  
And never take me out  
Till you can taste the way  
Do it again, and again till you say my name  
And by the way  
I'm so glad  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
She's hot on a rainy day  
Don't drown  
Call call me up, I I I can save you now  
(Lick your feet and kiss your lap)?  
[?]  
There's only one way we can stop the drought  
Come with me  
We can take a trip down south  
I can tell she's thirsty  
I'm in the whoa like a birdy  
Whatcha wanna do tonight?  
It's still early  
Wanna get some tonight  
She's all sturdy

Like a cigarette  
She wanna quit  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat

Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class  
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft  
Hold you like a paper plane  
You know I got paper babe  
Them dollar bills  
Girl I'll make it rain  
Holiday Inn  
Come and meet me on my eighth floor  
D--n it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?  
And I, I I I up on the [?]  
When I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide  
(There's a flood in your heart love)?  
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub  
Every night every day,  
Sippin' on a different drink  
Different chicks, different tastes  
I do it different ways  
Where you goin?  
Whatcha say?  
I'm why her river flowin'  
To another lake  
By to ocean by the ocean  
On the beach on the beach  
I'm bout' to take a swim  
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]  
We're born to fly  
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down  
Let's close our eyes  
And let the moment drive the whole world out  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
  
[Breakdown]  
  
[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]  
Waving colored flags  
We won't surrender, there's no standing down  
There's a playing field  
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
  
[Breakdown]  
  
[Bridge: Zara Larsson]  
In this together  
Woah, woah  
Oooooh  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you

You shout it out but I can't hear a word you say  
I'm talking loud, not saying much  
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet  
You shoot me down but I get up  
  
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose,  
Fire away, fire away  
Ricochet, you take your aim  
Fire away, fire away  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
  
Cut me down but it's you who has further to fall  
Ghost town, haunted love  
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones  
I'm talking loud, not saying much  
  
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose  
Fire away, fire away  
Ricochet, you take your aim  
Fire away, fire away  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
I am titanium  
I am titanium  
  
Stone-hard machine gun  
Firing at the ones who run  
Stone-hard thus bulletproof glass  
  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
  
I am titanium

Black hearts, black days  
Raindrops on my window pane  
Streetlights, street life  
Hot blood burning in my veins  
  
History won't drag me down  
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no  
It's buried six feet underground  
Let it go, go, go, let it go  
  
Hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
And if tomorrow never comes  
I'm gonna stay forever young  
These lungs of mine  
Were made to scream and shout  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
It seems like trouble's on the way  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
It's singing oh, oh oh oh  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
  
Tonight I've got a new life  
I gotta get right and get it moving  
White lies left me snowblind  
But now this time, I see right through it  
  
History won't drag me down  
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no  
It's buried six feet underground  
Let it go, go, go, let it go  
  
Hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
And if tomorrow never comes  
I'm gonna stay forever young  
These lungs of mine  
Were made to scream and shout  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
It seems like trouble's on the way  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
It's singing oh, oh oh oh  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday

You must be  
Living in a fantasy  
  
You've got me dreaming now I believe  
And there I saw you  
Looking oh so right  
Working the dance floor  
You superstar of the night  
You take me up you take me down  
Shake your body to the ground  
How do you do the things you do  
I know it must be true that you  
You pull me closer like I knew you would  
I try to please you the way you think I should  
You make me feel I'm in control  
You take my body and my soul  
You fill me up  
This empty cup  
I just can't get enough of you
