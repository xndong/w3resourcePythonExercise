Fantine:  
Cosette, it's turned so cold  
Cosette, it's past your bedtime  
You've played the day away, and soon it will be night  
  
Come to me, Cosette the light is fading  
Don't you see the evening star appearing?  
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder  
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder.  
Hurry near, another day is dying  
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?  
There's a darkness which comes without a warning  
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning.  
  
Valjean:  
Oh Fantine, your time is running out  
But Fantine, I swear this on my life  
  
Fantine:  
Look M'sieur, where all the children play...  
  
Valjean:  
Be at peace  
Be at peace evermore  
  
Fantine:  
My Cosette...  
  
Valjean:  
Shall live in my protection  
  
Fantine:  
Take her now...  
  
Valjean:  
Your child will want for nothing  
  
Fantine:  
Good M'sieur, you come from God in heaven  
  
Valjean:  
And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living  
  
Fantine:  
Take my hand, the night grows ever colder  
  
Valjean:  
And I will keep you warm  
  
Fantine:  
Take my child, I give her to your keeping  
  
Valjean:  
Take shelter from the storm  
  
Fantine:  
For God's sake, please stay 'till I am sleeping  
And tell Cosette I love her, and I'll see her when I wake...

Cosette  
I saw him once  
Then he was gone  
We were like dreamers at night  
Who meet as in a trace, then part again!  
Two phantoms in the shadows of the moon  
Can people really fall in love so soon?  
He walked alone  
He seemed alone like me  
Could he have known  
That moment was my destiny?  
I had to run away,  
And it was like a dream  
  
I saw him once  
The dream was true  
  
I saw him once,  
And once will do!

COSETTE:  
In my life  
I have all I could want.  
You are loving and gentle and good  
But Papa, dear Papa,  
In your eyes I am just like a child  
who is lost in a wood.  
  
VALJEAN:  
No more words  
No more, it's a time that is dead  
There are words  
That are better unheard  
Better unsaid.  
  
MARIUS:  
In my life  
She has burts like the music of angels  
the light of the sun!  
and my life seems to stop  
as if something is over  
and something has scarcely begun!  
  
MARIUS AND EPONINE:  
In my life  
there is someone who touches my life.  
  
MARIUS:  
waiting near!  
  
EPONINE:  
waiting here!

[Javert and constables break up the fight.  
Valjean picks himself up and looks for Cosette, who is with Marius.]  
  
Javert  
Another brawl in the square  
Another stink in the air!  
Was there a witness to this?  
Well, let him speak to Javert!  
M'sieur, the streets are not safe,  
But let these vermin beware  
We'll see that justice is done!  
  
Look upon this fine collection  
Crawled from underneath a stone  
This swarm of worms and maggots  
Could have picked you to the bone!  
I know this man over here  
I know his name and his trade  
And on your witness, M'sieur,  
We'll see him suitably paid.  
  
[Valjean and Cosette have disappeared.]  
  
But where's the gentleman gone?  
And why on earth did he run?  
  
Thenardier  
You will have a job to catch him  
He's the one you should arrest  
No more bourgeois when you scratch him  
Than that brand upon his chest!  
  
[The constables search for Valjean.]  
  
Javert  
Could it be he's some old jailbird  
That the tide now washes in  
Heard my name and started running  
Had the brand upon his skin  
And the girl who stood beside him  
When I turned they both had gone  
Could he be the man I've hunted?  
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?  
  
Thenardier  
In the absence of a victim,  
Dear Inspector, may I go?  
And remember when you've nicked him,  
It was me who told you so!  
  
Javert  
Let the old man keep on running  
I will run him off his feet!  
  
Everyone about your business  
Clear this garbage off the street!

[Javert walks the deserted streets until he comes to a bridge over the river
Seine.]  
  
Javert  
Who is this man?  
What sort of devil is he?  
To have me caught in a trap  
And choose to let me go free?  
It was his hour at last  
To put a seal on my fate  
Wipe out the past  
And wash me clean off the slate!  
All it would take  
Was a flick of his knife  
Vengeance was his  
And he gave me back my life!  
Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief!  
Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase.  
I am the Law and the Law is not mocked  
I'll spit his pity right back in his face  
There is nothing on earth that we share  
It is either Valjean or Javert!  
  
How can I now allow this man  
To hold dominion over me?  
This desperate man whom I have hunted  
He gave me my life, he gave me freedom.  
I should have perished by his hand!  
It was his right.  
It was my right to die as well  
Instead I live, but live in hell!  
And my thoughts fly apart  
Can this man be believed?  
Shall his sins be forgiven?  
Shall his crimes be reprieved?  
And must I now begin to doubt  
Who never doubted all these years?  
My heart is stone and still it trembles  
The world I have known is lost in shadow.  
Is he from heaven or from hell?  
And does he know  
That granting me my life today  
This man has killed me even so?  
I am reaching, but I fall  
And the stars are black and cold.  
As I stare into the void  
Of a world that cannot hold  
I'll escape now from the world  
From the world of Jean Valjean  
There is nowhere I can turn  
There is no way to go on.....  
  
[He throws himself into the swollen river.]

[The docks. Sailors, whores and their customers, pimps, etc. Fantine wanders
in.]  
  
Sailors  
I smell women  
Smell 'em in the air  
Think I'll drop my anchor  
In that harbor over there  
Lovely ladies  
Smell 'em through the smoke  
Seven days at sea  
Can make you hungry for a poke  
Even stokers need a little stoke!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for a bite  
Waiting for the customer  
Who only comes at night  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for the call  
Standing up or lying down  
Or any way at all  
Bargain prices up against the wall  
  
Old Woman  
Come here, my dear  
Let's see this trinket you wear  
This bagatelle...  
  
Fantine  
Madame, I'll sell it to you...  
  
Old Woman  
I'll give you four  
  
Fantine  
That wouldn't pay for the chain  
  
Old Woman  
I'll give you five, you're far to eager to sell, it's up to you.  
  
Fantine  
It's all I have  
  
Old Woman  
That's not my fault  
  
Fantine  
Please make it ten  
  
Old Woman  
No more than five  
My dear, we all must stay alive!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting in the dark  
Ready for a thick one  
Or a quick one in the park  
Long time short time  
Any time, my dear  
Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!  
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!  
  
Crone  
What pretty hair  
What pretty locks you got there  
What luck you got, it's worth a centime my dear  
I'll take the lot  
  
Fantine  
Don't touch me leave me alone  
  
Crone  
Let's make a price, I'll give you all of ten francs  
Just think of that!  
  
Fantine  
It pays a debt  
  
Crone  
Just think of that  
  
Fantine  
What can I do? It pays a debt.  
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Lovely little girls  
Lovely ladies  
Lovely little ladies  
Lovely girlies  
Lovely little girls  
We are lovely, lovely girls  
Lovely ladies  
What's a lady for? Sailors  
Lovely lady!  
Fastest on the street  
Wasn't there three minutes  
She was back up on her feet  
Lovely lady!  
What yer waiting for?  
Doesn't take a lot of savvy  
Just to be a whore  
Come on, lady  
What's a lady for?  
  
[Fantine re-emerges, her long hair cut short.]  
  
Pimp  
Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there?  
  
Whore 1  
A bit of skirt, she's the one sold her hair.  
  
Whore 2  
She's got a kid sends her all that she can  
  
Pimp  
I might have known  
There is always some man  
Lovely lady, come along and join us!  
Lovely lady!  
  
Whores  
Come on dearie, why all the fuss?  
You're no grander than the rest of us  
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap  
Join your sisters, make money in your sleep!  
  
[Fantine goes off with one of the sailors.]  
  
That's right dearie, let him have the lot  
That's right dearie, show him what you've got!  
  
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come  
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum  
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land  
See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand  
All it takes is money in your hand!  
Lovely ladies  
Going for a song  
Got a lot of callers  
But they never stay for long  
  
Fantine  
Come on, Captain  
You can wear your shoes  
Don't it make a change  
To have a girl who can't refuse  
Easy money  
Lying on a bed  
Just as well they never see  
The hate that's in your head  
Don't they know they're making love  
To one already dead!

[Valjean arrives, dressed as a soldier.]  
  
Joly  
Here comes a man in uniform  
What brings you to this place?  
  
Valjean  
I come here as a volunteer  
  
Joly  
Approach and show your face.  
  
Sentry  
You wear an army uniform.  
  
Valjean  
That's why they let me through.  
  
Joly  
You've got some years behind you sir.  
  
Valjean  
There's much that I can do.  
  
Joly  
You see that prisoner over there?  
  
Grantaire  
A volunteer like you!  
  
Combeferre  
A spy who calls himself Javert!  
  
Grantaire  
He's going to get it too...  
  
Sentry  
They're getting ready to attack!

Eponine  
And now I'm all alone again nowhere to turn, no one to go to  
Without a home without a friend without a face to say hello to  
And now the night is near  
Now I can make believe he's here  
  
Sometimes I walk alone at night  
When everybody else is sleeping  
I think of him and then I'm happy  
With the company I'm keeping  
The city goes to bed  
And I can live inside my head  
  
On my own  
Pretending he's beside me  
All alone  
I walk with him 'til morning  
Without him  
I feel his arms around me  
And when I lose my way I close my eyes  
And he has found me  
  
In the rain the pavement shines like silver  
All the lights are misty in the river  
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight  
And all I see is him and me forever and forever  
  
And I know it's only in my mind  
That I'm talking to myself and not to him  
And although I know that he is blind  
Still I say, there's a way for us  
  
I love him  
But when the night is over  
He is gone  
The river's just a river  
Without him  
The world around me changes  
The trees are bare and everywhere  
The streets are full of strangers  
  
I love him  
But every day I'm learning  
All my life  
I've only been pretending  
Without me  
His world would go on turning  
A world that's full of happiness  
That I have never known  
  
I love him  
I love him  
I love him  
But only on my own

Combeferre:  
At Notre Dame  
The sections are prepared!  
  
Fueilly:  
At rue de Bac  
They're straining at the leash!  
  
Courfeyrac:  
Students, workers, everyone  
There's a river on the run  
Like the flowing of the tide  
Paris coming to our side!  
  
Enjolras:  
The time is near...  
So near... it's stirring the blood in their veins!  
And yet beware...  
Don't let the wine go to your brains!  
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe  
With the men and the arms that we never can match  
Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies  
But the national guard will be harder to catch.  
We need a sign  
To rally the people  
To call them to arms  
To bring them in line!  
Marius, you're late.  
  
Jean Provaire:  
What's wrong today?  
You look as if you've seen a ghost.  
  
Grantaire:  
Some wine and say what's going on!  
  
Marius:  
A ghost you say... a ghost maybe  
She was just like a ghost to me  
One minute there, and she was gone!  
  
Grantaire:  
I am agog!  
I am aghast!  
Is Marius in love at last?  
I have never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah'  
You talk of battles to be won  
But here he comes like Don Ju-an  
It's better than an o-per-a!  
  
Enjolras:  
It is time for us all  
To decide who we are...  
Do we fight for the right  
To a night at the opera now?  
Have you asked of yourselves  
What's the price you might pay?  
Is it simply a game  
For rich young boys to play?  
The colors of the world  
Are changing  
Day by day...  
Red - the blood of angry men!  
Black - the dark of ages past!  
Red - a world about to dawn!  
Black - the night that ends at last!  
  
Marius:  
Had you been there tonight  
You might know how it feels  
To be struck to the bone  
In a moment of breathless delight!  
Had you been there tonight  
You might also have known  
How the world may be changed  
In just one burst of light!  
And what was right  
Seems wrong  
And what was wrong  
Seems right...  
  
Grantaire:  
Red...  
  
Marius:  
I feel my soul on fire!  
  
Grantaire:  
Black...  
  
Marius:  
My world if she's not there...  
  
Chorus:  
Red...  
  
Marius  
The color of desire!  
  
Chorus:  
Black...  
  
Marius:  
The color of despair!  
  
Enjolras:  
Marius, you're no longer a child  
I do not doubt you mean it well  
But now there is a higher call  
Who cares about your lonely soul  
We strive toward a larger goal  
Our little lives don't count at all!  
  
Enjolras and Chorus:  
Red - the blood of angry men!  
Black - the dark of ages past!  
Red - a world about to dawn!  
Black - the night that ends at last!  
  
Enjolras:  
Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns?  
Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short.  
Grantaire, put the bottle down!  
Do we have the guns we need?  
  
Grantaire [drunk]  
Give me brandy on my breath  
And I'll breath 'em all to death!  
  
Courfeyrac  
In St. Antoine they're with us to a man!  
  
Combeferre  
In Notre Dame they're tearing up the stones!  
  
Feuilly  
Twenty rifles good as new.  
  
[Gavroche rushes in, shouting.]  
  
Gavroche  
Listen!  
  
Jean Prouvaire  
Double that in Port St. Cloud!  
  
Gavroche  
Listen everybody!  
General Lamarque  
Is dead!  
  
Enjolras  
Lamarque is dead.  
Lamarque! His death is the hour of fate.  
The people's man.  
His death is the sign we await!  
On his funeral day they will honor his name.  
With the light of rebellion, a blaze in their eyes.  
From the candles of grief we will kindle our flame!  
On the tomb of Lamarque shall the barricade rise!  
The time is here!  
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer  
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts  
But a jubilant shout  
They will come one and all  
They will come when we call!

[Valjean and Young Cosette arrive at the now empty inn, hand in hand.]  
  
Valjean  
I found her wandering in the wood  
This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows  
And I am here to help Cosette  
And I will settle any debt you may think proper  
I will pay what I must pay  
To take Cosette away.  
There is a duty I must heed,  
There is a promise I have made  
For I was blind to one in need  
I did not see what stood before me  
Now her mother is with God  
Fantine's suffering is over  
And I speak here with her voice  
And I stand here in her place  
And from this day and evermore  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Let me have your coat, M'sieur  
  
Valjean  
Cosette shall live in my protection  
  
Thenardier  
You are very welcome here  
  
Valjean  
I shall not forsake my vow  
  
Thenardier  
Take a glass  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Take a chair  
  
Valjean  
Cosette shall have a father now!

Army Officer [from beyond the barricade]  
You at the barricade listen to this  
The people of Paris sleep in their beds  
You have no chance  
No chance at all  
Why throw your lives away?  
  
Enjolras  
Let us die facing our foes  
Make them bleed while we can  
  
Combeferre  
Make 'em pay through the nose  
  
Courfeyrac  
Make 'em pay for every man!  
  
Enjolras  
Let others rise  
To take our place  
Until the earth is free!  
  
[Amidst increasingly heavy gunfire, Marius is shot. Enjolras is killed at the
summit of the barricade. All at the barricade are killed, except Marius, who
is wounded and unconscious, and Valjean. Valjean discovers that Marius is
still alive and carries him down into the sewers to escape. Javert climbs over
the barricade looking for Valjean's body. Not finding it, he realizes that
Valjean must be in the sewers, so he goes off to where he must emerge.]

[The crowd parts to reveal that the cart has crashed, trapping M.
Fauchelevant.]  
  
Voices  
Look at that!  
Look at that!  
It's Monsieur Fauchelevant!  
Don't approach! Don't go near!  
At the risk of your life!  
He is caught by the wheel!  
Oh, the pitiful man.  
Stay away, turn away,  
There is nothing to do..  
There is nothing to do..  
  
Valjean  
Is there anyone here  
Who will rescue the man?  
Who will help me to shoulder  
The weight of the cart?  
  
Voices  
Don't go near him, Mr. Mayor  
The load is heavy as hell  
The old man's a goner for sure  
It'll kill you as well.  
  
[Valjean attempts to lift the cart. They manage to pull Fauchelevant clear.]  
  
Fauchelevant  
M'sieur le Mayor, I have no words  
You come from God, you are a saint.  
  
[Javert takes Valjean aside.]  
  
Javert  
Can this be true?  
I don't believe what I see!  
A man your age  
To be as strong as you are...  
A memory stirs..  
You make me think of a man  
From years ago  
A man who broke his parole  
He disappeared  
Forgive me, Sir,  
I would not dare!  
  
Valjean  
Say what you must, don't leave it there.  
  
Javert  
I have only known one other  
Who can do what you have done  
He's a convict from the chain gang  
He's been ten years on the run  
But he couldn't run forever  
We have found his hideaway  
And he's just been re-arrested  
And he comes to court today.  
Of course he now denies it  
You'd expect that of a con  
But he couldn't run forever,  
No, not even Jean Valjean!  
  
Valjean  
You say this man denies it all  
And gives no sign of understanding or repentance?  
You say this man is going to trial  
And that's he's sure to be returned  
To serve his sentence?  
Come to that, can you be sure,  
That I am not your man?  
  
Javert  
I have known the thief for ages  
Tracked him down through thick and thin  
And to make the matter certain  
There's the brand upon his skin  
He will bend, he will break  
This time there is no mistake.  
  
[Javert leaves, Valjean is alone.]

[Marius and Cosette lead a wedding procession.]  
  
Chorus  
Ring out the bells upon this day of days!  
May all the angels of the Lord above  
In jubilation sing their songs of praise!  
And crown this blessed time with peace and love.  
  
[The procession becomes a dancing celebration. A waltz is played.]  
  
Major Domo  
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their  
Respects to the groom!  
  
Thenardier  
I forget where we met  
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge  
Where the duke did that puke  
Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?  
  
Marius  
No, 'Baron de Thenard'  
The circles I move in are humbler by far.  
Go away, Thenardier!  
Do you think I don't know who you are?  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
He's not fooled, told you so.  
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show.  
Tell the boy what you know!  
  
[Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes.]  
  
Marius  
When I look at you, I remember Eponine  
She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth  
But now she is with God and happier, I hope  
Than here on earth!  
  
[The waltz starts up again.]  
  
Thenardier  
So it goes, heaven knows  
Life has dealt me some terrible blows.  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
You've got cash and a heart  
You could give us a bit of a start  
We can prove, plain as ink  
Your bride's father is not what you think.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a tale I could tell  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Information we're willing to sell.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a man that he slew  
I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!  
What I tell you is true!  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this  
But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss.  
  
Marius  
In God's name say what you have to say.  
  
Thenardier  
But first you pay!  
  
What I saw, clear as light  
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night  
Had this corpse on his back  
Hanging there like a great bloody sack.  
I was there, never fear  
Even found me this fine souvenir!  
  
[Thenardier shows Marius a ring.]  
  
Marius  
I know this! This was mine!  
Surely this is some heavenly sign!  
  
Thenardier  
One more thing, mark this well  
It was the night the barricades fell.  
  
Marius  
Then it's true, then I'm right  
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!  
  
[Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him.]  
  
As for you, take this too!  
God forgive the things that we do.  
  
Come my love, come Cosette  
This day's blessings are not over yet!  
  
[Marius and Cosette leave.]

[Enjolras is addressing the revolutionaries.]  
  
Enjolras  
Here upon these stones  
We will build our barricade  
In the heart of the city  
We claim as our own!  
Each man to his duty  
And don't be afraid.  
Wait! I will need a report  
On the strength of the foe.  
  
Javert [disguised as a rebel]  
I can find out the truth  
I know their ways  
Fought their wars  
Served my time  
In the days  
Of my youth!  
  
Various Students  
Now the people will fight  
And so they might  
Dogs will back  
Fleas will bite.  
They will do what is right  
  
[Marius spots Eponine, who is dressed as a boy.]  
  
Marius  
Hey little boy, what's this I see?  
God Eponine, the things you do!  
  
Eponine  
I know this is no place for me  
Still I would rather be with you.  
  
Marius  
Get out before the trouble starts  
Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot  
  
Eponine  
I got you worried, now I have  
That shows you like me quite a lot  
  
Marius  
There is a way that you can help  
You are the answer to a prayer  
Please take this letter to Cosette  
And pray to God that she's still there!  
  
[She walks to the Rue Plumet...]  
  
Eponine  
Little you know...  
Little you care!  
  
[... Where she meets Valjean.]  
  
I have a letter M'sieur  
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette  
It's from a boy at the barricade, Sir  
In the Rue de Villette.  
  
Valjean  
Give me that letter here, my boy  
  
Eponine  
He said to give it to Cosette  
  
Valjean  
You have my word that my daughter will know  
What this letter contains.  
  
[He gives her a coin.]  
  
Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow  
And here's for your pains  
Go careful now, stay out of sight  
There's danger in the streets tonight.  
  
[He opens the letter... And reads it.]  
  
''Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul  
And soon you will be gone.  
Can it be only a day since we met  
And the world was reborn?  
If I should fall in the battle to come  
Let this be my goodbye  
Now that I know you love me as well  
It is harder to die...  
I pray that god will bring me home  
To be with you.  
Pray for your Marius, he prays for you! ''  
  
[Valjean goes in, leaving Eponine alone.]

What have I done?  
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?  
Become a thief in the night!  
Become a dog on the run!  
Have I fallen so far  
And is the hour so late  
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate,  
The cries in the dark that nobody hears,  
Here where I stand at the turning of the years.  
If there is another way to go  
I missed it twenty long years ago.  
My life was a war that could never be won  
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean  
When they chained me and let me for dead  
Just for stealing a mouth full of bread.  
Yet why did I allow that man  
To touch my sould and teach me love?  
He treated me like any other.  
He gave me his trust.  
He called me Brother.  
My life he claims for God above.  
Can such things be?  
For I had come to hate the world.  
This world that always hated me!  
Take an eye for an eye.  
Turn your heart into stone.  
This is all I have lived for.  
This is all I have known.  
One word from him and I'd be back  
Beneath the lash, upon the rack.  
Instead, he offers me my freedom.  
I feel my shame inside me like a knife,  
He told me that I had a soul.  
How does he know?  
What spirit comes to move my life?  
Is there another way to go?  
I am reaching, but I fall,  
And the night is closing in,  
And I stare into the void,  
To the whirpool of my sin.  
I'll escape now from the world  
From the world of Jean Valjean.  
Jean Valjean is nothing now.  
Another story must begin!
