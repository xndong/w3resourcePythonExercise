I'm holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground  
And I'm hearing what you say  
But I just can't make a sound  
  
You tell me that you need me  
Then you go and cut me down, but wait  
You tell me that you're sorry  
Didn't think I'd turn around and say  
  
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
Too late, oh  
  
I'd take another chance, take a fall  
Take a shot for you  
And I need you like a heart needs a beat  
But it's nothing new, yeah yeah  
  
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue  
And you say sorry like the angel  
Heaven let me think was you  
But I'm afraid  
  
It's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa whoa  
  
It's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
  
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late  
  
I'm holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground

Today I'm not myself  
And you, you're someone else  
And all these rules don't fit  
And all that starts can quit  
  
What a peculiar state, we're in  
What a peculiar state, we're in  
  
Let's play a game  
Where all of the lives we lead  
Could change  
Let's play a game  
Where nothing that we can see  
The same  
  
But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles  
Slippin' out under the locks  
I could show you how many moves to checkmate right now  
We could take apart this life we're building  
And pack it up inside a box  
All that really matters is we're doing it right now  
Right now  
  
But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles  
Slippin' out under the locks  
I could show you how many moves to checkmate right now  
We could take apart this life we're building  
And pack it up inside a box  
All that really matters is we're doing it right now  
Right now

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Yeah, we'll be counting stars  
  
I see this life  
Like a swinging vine  
Swing my heart across the line  
In my faces flashing signs  
Seek it out and ye shall find  
  
Old, but I'm not that old  
Young, but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
I'm just doing what we're told  
  
I feel something so right  
Doing the wrong thing  
I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie, could lie, could lie  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
I feel the love  
And I feel it burn  
Down this river every turn  
Hope is a four letter word  
Make that money  
Watch it burn  
Old, but I'm not that old  
Young, but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
I'm just doing what we're told  
I, feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie, could lie, could lie  
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars

Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be  
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)

Well hell sees her shadow in my backseat  
And her friends are standing right in front of me  
World wide from the center burning turkey  
Open up said everybody loves me  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
'Cause they got what you need  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
God love all the people that have warned you  
God love all your sentimental virtue  
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you  
Lay calls with the lovers that'll hate you  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
They got what you need  
What you need  
Make you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Well I  
Play the music don't stop till I turn gray  
Stars like forever John Sousa never fade,  
He had a beautiful child, named Desiree  
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made  
  
'Cause you don't have to make a sound  
When they got what you need  
Like you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Oh  
Everybody  
Everybody  
  
Don't need my health  
Got my name and got my wealth I  
Stare at the sun  
Just for kicks all by myself I  
Lose track of time  
So I might be past my prime  
But  
I'm feeling oh so good  
Yeah!  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me!  
  
Don't you know you wanna  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Whoa! Yeah!

No sleep  
Today  
Can't even rest when the suns down  
No time  
There's not enough  
And nobody's watchin' me now  
  
When we were children we'd play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children we'd say  
That we don't the meaning of  
Fear, fear, fear,  
Fear, fear, fear  
We don't know the meaning of  
  
When we were children we'd play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children we'd say  
That we don't the meaning of  
Fear, fear, fear,  
Fear, fear, fear  
We don't know the meaning of  
  
Wish I  
Didn't know the meaning of

Woke up in London yesterday  
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly  
Don't really know how I got here  
I got some pictures on my phone  
  
New names and numbers that I don't know  
Address to places like Abbey Road  
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want  
We're young enough to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh this has gotta be the good life  
This has gotta be the good life  
This could really be a good life, good life  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
To my friends in New York, I say hello  
My friends in L.A. they don't know  
Where I've been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out  
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about  
  
When you're happy like a fool  
Let it take you over  
When everything is out  
You gotta take it in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
A good good life  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Hopelessly  
I feel like like there might be something that I'll miss  
Hopelessly  
I feel like the window closes oh so quick  
Hopelessly  
I'm taking a mental picture of you now  
'Cause hopelessly  
The hope is we have so much to feel good about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life, oh yeah  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh yeah, a good good life, good life  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Whoah, woah, listen,  
  
To my friends in New York, I say hello  
My friends in L.A. they don't know  
Where I've been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out  
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about

I can't sleep, no not like I used to  
I can't breathe in and out like I need to  
It's breaking ice now to make any movement  
What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion  
  
All at once  
(As I'm trying)  
I can help you out  
(Just to keep things right)  
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything  
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
Goodbye apathy, so long apathy  
  
So don't sit still  
Don't you move away from here  
  
So goodbye apathy  
(As I'm trying)  
So long fancy free  
(Just to keep things right)  
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you  
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
  
I don't walk right, not like I used to  
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you  
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me  
As long as you're close to me  
  
Now that I'm alright  
(As I'm trying)  
I can help you out  
(Just to keep things right)  
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything  
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
Goodbye apathy, so goodbye apathy  
  
So don't you stop pushing me  
I can take so much  
  
So goodbye apathy  
(As I'm trying)  
So long fancy free  
(Just to keep things right)  
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you  
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
Everybody is watching me too  
Everybody is watching you  
Everybody is watching me too  
(I can't sleep)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
(No)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(Not like I used to)  
Everybody is watching you  
(I can't breathe in)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(Not like I need to)  
  
Everybody is watching you  
(It's breaking ice now to make any movement)  
Everybody is watching me too  
Everybody is watching you  
(What's your vice?)  
Everybody is watching me too  
(You know that mine's the illusion)

Start, I'm might start with this  
Just a single thought followed by words  
I hope I don't miss, miss anything  
Write you a letter but it's better that you hear me  
  
I suppose, I could sing  
Write a song to share the meaning  
Of the love for you I'm feeling  
People saying what they will, I don't care  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices calling out  
What would they say?  
What would it change?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take?  
What would they say to me if only I was listening?  
  
Catch my 22, I'd gladly give it to somebody  
Because I only wanna be with you  
I lost and used your love  
I start to drown and you go and pull me up  
Don't you listen to what they say?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices calling out  
What would they say?  
What would it change?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take?  
What would they say if I was listening?  
  
Come here, there's something I should tell you  
Darling, don't fear 'cause I am going, going away  
  
Voices all around  
I'm hearing voices  
What will they say?  
What will they say?  
  
I'm hearing voices  
Voices all  
Voices all around  
I'm hearing voices all around

Hoping you take that jump  
But don't fear the fall  
Hope when the water rises  
You built a wall  
Hoping the crowd screams out  
Screaming your name  
Hope if everybody runs  
You choose to stay  
Hope that you fall in love  
And it hurts so bad  
The only way you can know  
Is give it all you have  
And I hope that you don't suffer  
But take the pain  
Hope when the moment comes you say  
  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
The things that I did  
With every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
  
Hope that you spend your days  
But they all add up  
And when that sun goes down  
Hope you raise your cup  
I wish that I could witness  
All your joy and all your pain  
But until my moment comes  
I'll say  
  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
And things that I did  
With every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
  
With every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
With every broken bone  
I swear I lived  
  
I, I did it all  
I, I did it all  
I owned every second  
That this world could give  
I saw so many places  
And things that I did girl  
With every broken bone  
I swear I lived

I stared up at the sun  
Thought of all other people, places and things I've loved  
I stared up just to see  
Of all other faces, you are the one next to me  
You can feel the light start to tremble  
Washing what you know out the sea yeah  
You can see your life out of the window, tonight  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
It'll be by your side  
If I lose myself tonight (whoa, whoa, whoa)  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
It'll be you and I  
Lose myself tonight  
  
I woke up with the sun  
Thought of all other people, places and things I've loved  
I woke up just to see  
Of all other faces you were the one next to me  
You can feel the light start to tremble  
Washing what you know out the sea yeah  
You can see your life out of the window, tonight  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
It'll be by your side  
If I lose myself tonight (whoa, whoa, whoa)  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
It'll be you and I  
Lose myself tonight (whoa)  
Whoo  
Oh ooh  
  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40,000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40,000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40,000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40,000 feet keep flying  
  
Lose myself  
If I lose myself tonight  
Hoo hoo ooh  
Hoo hoo ooh

I do my best  
To find some kind of glow  
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now  
From the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
Yeah, we see that fire  
From the streets of Babylon  
To the road that we've been on now  
The kaleidoscope claims another  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in color (color)  
Today feels like no other (other)  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
And just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
This is life in color  
  
You've seen my worst  
Yet you see some hope in me  
The black and white sets us free  
Like the queen to the rook  
Your decision is a sure thing  
Honey yeah, a sure thing  
No wonder I feel  
Like I'm missing a heavy load  
But no matter what daylight brings to us  
We all know  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in color (color)  
Today feels like no other (other)  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
And just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
This is life in color  
This is life in color  
  
This is life in color  
Today feels like no other  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, cloud breaks  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
Just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, cloud breaks  
This is life in color  
This is life in color

Days feel hard earned  
Night grows longer  
Summer says its goodbyes  
And darkness covers  
We find shelter  
Our own place to hide  
  
Oh  
As the light goes out  
Thoughts turn to angels  
Over us  
Oh  
As the night comes in  
Dreams start their drifting  
And you hear  
A lullaby  
  
Ooooh  
A lullaby  
You and I  
  
Trees touch windows  
Say their hellos  
We hear this house as it settles in  
Worry slips away  
It don't know your name  
It don't know where to find us  
  
Oh  
As the light goes out  
Thoughts turn to angels  
All around us  
Oh  
As the night comes in  
Dreams start their drifting  
And we hear  
A lullaby  
A lullaby  
You and I  
You and I  
  
Lullaby  
Oooh

One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four  
  
I was writing  
Thinking with my long hand  
Flippin' the paper  
Everything was sinking  
In start to wonder  
How you gonna handle me?  
When I'm under  
Swimming in the dark sea  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take it, t-t-t-take it  
  
Can you feel all the love

Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
Like it was made for you!  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
It was made for you  
  
Tell me something  
Something that can move me  
Don't tell me lies  
I swear your gonna lose me  
Big like an ocean  
Jealous of the fish it feeds  
Your devotion  
Swimming inside of me  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to t-t-t-take it  
[Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
Can you feel all the love

All the right moves and all the right faces  
All the right friends in all the right places  
All the right moves and all the right faces

All the right friends in all the right places

All the right moves and all the right faces  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right friends in all the right places  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right moves and all the right faces

For those days we felt like a mistake,  
Those times when love's what you hate  
Somehow  
We keep marchin' on  
  
For those nights when I couldn't be there,  
I've made it harder to know that you know  
That somehow  
We'll keep movin' on  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isn't a flag I'd wave  
Don't care where we've been  
I'd sink us to swim  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For those doubts that swirl all around us  
For those lives that tear at the seams  
We know  
We're not what we've seen  
  
Oh  
For this dance we move with each other  
There ain't no other step  
Than one foot  
Right in front of the other  
Oh  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isn't a flag I'd wave  
Don't care where we've been  
I'd sink us to swim  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, marchin' on  
  
We'll have the days we break  
And we'll have the scars to prove it  
We'll have the bombs that we saved  
But we'll have the heart  
Not to lose it  
  
For all of the times we've stopped  
For all of the things I'm not  
  
Oh!  
You put one foot in front of the other  
We've move like we ain't got no other  
We go where we go we're marchin' on  
Marchin' on  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
we're marchin' on  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right,  
Marchin' on  
Marchin' on  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right,  
Marchin' on  
Marchin' on

I saw your face, stuck in a crowd  
Silently screaming out loud  
I felt the beat echo your heart  
Throw me a line 'cause it's too far  
  
All that you want, all that you see  
All that you thought that you believe  
  
Is it enough? Do you think it's too much?  
You say you only trust what you can touch  
  
All you got to do is reach out for it  
  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love.  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love.  
  
Up to the ledge, put out my hands  
Scared to the bones of where I'd land  
Trade in my fears, trade in my thoughts  
They disappear behind your walls  
  
All that I want, all that I need  
All that I thought I believed  
Was it enough? Sure not too much?  
Now you're the only thing that I can trust  
  
All I got to do is reach out for it  
  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love.  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love.  
  
It's all for you  
It's all for you

We say goodbye, I turn my back  
Run away, run away, so predictable  
Not far from here, you see me crack  
Like a bone, like a bone, I'm so breakable  
  
I'll take everything from you  
But you'll take anything, won't you?  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
I'm on the road to who knows where  
Look ahead, not behind I keep saying  
There's no place to go where you're not there  
On your rope I hold tight but it's freeing  
  
I'll take everything from you  
But you'll take anything, won't you?  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
Everybody wants to be right  
But only if it's not a day light  
I keep trying to find my way back  
My way back  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
Runaway, runaway, runaway  
From you, from you, from you

I need another story  
Something to get off my chest  
My life gets kinda boring  
Need something that I can confess  
Til' all my sleeves are stained red  
From all the truth that I've said  
Come by it honestly I swear  
Thought you saw me wink, no  
I've been on the brink, so  
  
Tell me what you want to hear  
Something that will light those ears  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics ever jump in line  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
  
My God, amazing how we got this far  
It's like we're chasing all those stars  
Who's driving shiny big black cars  
And everyday I see the news  
All the problems that we could solve  
And when a situation rises  
Just write it into an album  
Send it straight to gold  
I don't really like my flow, no, so  
  
Tell me what you want to hear  
Something that are like those years  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics never jump in line  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
  
Oh, got no reason, got no shame  
Got no family I can't blame  
Just don't let me disappear  
I'mma tell you everything  
  
So tell me what you want to hear  
Something that'll light those ears  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics never jump in line  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
  
So tell me what you want to hear  
Something that delight those ears  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics ever jump in line  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
All my secrets away, all my secrets away

Come come my dear, take flight, come near  
I see your fear creeping around you  
First love then hate, then love, no wait  
Your confusion, it's gonna kill me  
  
I broke for you, I woke for you  
You tore me through, god love you  
I see the signs are out of line  
No fault of mine except for  
  
Don't say his name now  
  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, something ain't right here  
  
You screamed, I begged, what's that you said?  
Your clouded head's telling you lies now  
You hear my voice, you make some noise  
You stole my choice it's over  
  
And I pray for you now  
I speak to you  
  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, something ain't right here  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, fallen out for  
Fallen out, you've fallen out!  
Why can't you see it?  
  
I'll pray for you now  
I'm speaking to

You say you're a minute from the deep end  
You cut cold the courtesy it's sink or swim now  
and your body's aching for a breath I'll give it to you  
With a trap door to take in of all of this  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close to me to come  
  
I've seen the foolish shame the ways  
You just kept crying with his own surprises  
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all  
And you're not a foolish one at all  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Can you hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close to me to come  
  
Yes you're too close  
  
Lost the feeling you know  
You're the victim of  
Kick start the clothes let it go  
You don't need them  
Only flesh blood and bones I'm the same old guy  
  
If I were to know today  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close now  
  
Ooh, ooh  
Come away  
Oh

I found variety  
On Nolan's Avenue  
Down where the air is thick  
As L.A. skies are blue  
The water tried to break it down  
But it held through  
It gave a little for the sake of staying true  
  
We cut ties  
We tell lies  
We hate change  
And we wanna claim where we feel  
We take toes  
We rake yours  
Yeah we dig holes  
And we're diggin' right in your fears  
  
We're waking up  
We're waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
We'll take these roads  
We'll break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time!  
  
We got cars  
We write laws  
We won't pause  
Don't you know we're wizards working in Oz  
We don't lose  
We might bruise  
Yeah but we'll rain fire on ya till you're playing  
All of your cards  
  
We're waking up  
We're waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
We'll take these roads  
We'll break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time!  
On time!  
Right on time!  
Waking up!  
Waking up!  
Yeah  
  
Ooh!  
Oh!  
Ooh!

I'll find the places where you hide  
I'll be the dawn on your worst night  
The only thing left in your life  
Yeah I would kill for you, that's right  
  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
  
I'll put your poison in my veins  
They say the best love is insane, yeah  
I'll light your fire till my last day  
I'll let your fields burn around me, around me  
  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
  
I'll run now, 'cause this time  
Oh, my love is true  
Tell me, something I wouldn't do  
  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted  
If that's what you wanted
