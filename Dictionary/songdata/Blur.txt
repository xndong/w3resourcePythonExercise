On sticks and sand, lost my money, lost my hands  
Blood on my brain, too much salt in my veins  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones aren't sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long  
  
So many days never needing any grace  
Live for kicks and danger, there'd be beauty anyway  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones aren't sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long x3

(Food processors are great!)  
It's six o'clock on the dot and I'm half way home  
I feel foul mouthed as I stand and wait for the underground  
And a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this  
I need something to remind me that there's something else  
  
You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
  
Advertisements are here for rapid persuasion  
If you stare too long you lose your appetite  
A nervous disposition doesn't agree with this  
You need fast relief from aches and stomach pains  
  
I need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,  
12, 13, 14, 15, 16  
  
(You can have it on the rates  
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a one week only special offer.)  
  
You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Go on!  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else

Give me gas when it gets too much  
Not an uncommon thing  
Everyone does (as such)  
Here we go, up on all fours  
Got bright ideas on how to win wars  
(cos 1 2 3 4...)  
All we want, all we ever want  
Listen to something but I just say nothing  
All we want, all anybody wants  
Listen to something but I just hear nothing  
Another episode just got binned  
Next weeks repeat sees me living in  
Inconsequence  
Vitality  
Struck hidden eyes, it's all over me  
All we want, all we ever want  
Listen to something but I just say nothing  
All we want, all anybody wants  
Listen to something but I just hear nothing  
All we want, all we ever want  
Listen to something but I just say nothing  
All we want, all anybody wants  
Listen to something but I just hear nothing  
Listen to something but I just hear nothing

Put a new T-shirt on, wash my face in beer  
Fall through the crowd and disappear  
In the teenage magazines and shopping malls  
Walk through the wildlife for miles and miles  
  
Hold my breath and count a hundred and ten  
And back up the hill to start again  
Watching spiders on the bedroom ceiling  
They got big plans so they're not breathing  
  
Feel the frisson of tomorrow today  
I could get up but it won't go away  
Do nothing to impress my friends  
Just rub my eyes for hours on end  
  
Oh England, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool  
I need someone to tell me everything'll be alright  
I need someone who'll hold me when the day turns to night  
I need someone who loves me more than you do  
  
Oh we say that's not true  
And you and me in line as double bill  
Surrogate heroes on TV and films  
I've never met anyone like you  
  
I've never done the things you like to do

Brothers and sisters  
Rebuild your lives  
We're all drug takers  
Give us something tonight  
  
A cartoon in a ketamine  
Jelly mixed with margarine  
White doves from the war machine  
Every body movin  
Cocaine is for murderers  
Codeine for the jurors  
Caffeine been through all of us  
All the people horny  
Crackwhores back in town again  
Eggships sniffing benelyn  
Burning all the oil again  
Smoking makes you holy  
Textin abbreviates the brain  
Aspirin takes away the pain  
Rock on, everyone the same  
That's the way it is  
  
Brothers and sisters  
Rebuild your lives  
We're all drug takers  
Give us something tonight  
  
Rohypnol like a chloroform  
Sugar from the day you are born  
Washed out like a dinosaur  
Really don't believe it.  
Sticky sniffing superglue  
sulphates keep you in a zoo  
Monkeys turning into you  
Everybody horney  
Acid good up on the moors  
Gimpo stops you getting bored  
Beta's busy making laws  
Procaine stops you screaming  
Librium for anxiety  
Drinking it our society  
That's the way it is  
that's the way it is even when we're pissed

I've gotta get over  
I've gotta get over  
I've got to get better  
Will love you forever  
I've gotta find genius  
I've gotta get better  
I've gotta stop smoking  
I've gotta get better  
  
Caramel Caramel  
  
Where is the magic?  
I've gotta get better  
Oh lord give me magic  
I'll love you forever  
I've gotta find mounts hill  
And live by the mountains  
I'll love you forever  
You are...And you are

Caravan is lost  
In the sun and the dust  
No-one loves you  
When you are lost  
Yeah I've been a clown  
Trying to pull my whole world down  
I thought I was strong  
But you are the one  
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it  
The weight of it  
And the day and you'll get away from it,  
Away from it  
  
Sometimes everything is easy  
Sometimes everything is easy  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
  
I try to quit  
But my heart won't buy it  
I got family  
The caravan comes back for me  
  
And when it comes you'll feel the weight of it,  
The weight of it  
And the day, and you'll get away from it  
Away from it  
  
Sometimes everything is easy  
Sometimes everything is easy  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la (repeat)  
  

I met him in a crowded room  
Where people go to drink away their gloom  
He sat me dawn and so began, the story of a charmless man  
Educated the expensive way, he knows his Claret from a Beaujolais  
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray  
But then nature didn't make him that way  
  
He thinks he's educated, airs those family shares  
Will protect him that we will respect him  
He moves in circles of friends  
Who just pretend that they like him  
He does the same to them, and when you put it all together  
There's the model of a charmless man  
  
He knows the swingers and their cavalry  
Says he can get in anywhere for free  
I began to go a little cross eyed  
And from this charmless man I just had to hide  
  
He talks at speed he gets nosebleeds  
He doesn't see his days  
Are tumbling down upon him  
And yet he tries so hard to please  
He's just so keen for you to listen  
But no one is listening  
And when you put it all together  
There's the model of a charmless man

The pay-me girl has had enough of the bleeps  
So she takes the bus into the country  
Although she got herself rosy cheeks  
She didn't leave enough money to pay the rent  
The landlord says that she's out in a week  
What a shame she was just getting comfy  
Now she's eating chocolate to induce sleep  
In a chemical world, it's very, very, very cheap  
  
And I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
  
Peeping Thomas has a very nice view  
Across the street at the exhibitionist  
These townies they never speak to you  
Just stick together so they never get lonely  
Feeling lead, feeling quite light-headed  
Had to sit down and have some sugary tea  
In chemical world, in a chemical world  
It's very, very, very cheap  
  
And I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes, yes  
  
I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
And now she's found about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
Well I don't know about you  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through

You put me together, break my bones  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
So happy together, would break my bones.  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me.  
  
Spinning together, watch us go.  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me.  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me, to see through me.  
I've got to get you close to me (x2)

I'm on the white cliffs of Dover  
Thinking it over and over  
But if I jump its all over  
A cautionary tale for you  
I'd like to roll in the clover  
With you over and over  
On the white cliffs of Dover  
And then I'd let you push me over  
  
[Chorus]  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact it's  
Not where it's at  
And it's over  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact it's  
Not where it's at  
And it's over  
Yes it is  
  
And now the bluebirds are over  
Over the white cliffs of Dover  
So when you push me over  
Don't bury me I'm not worth anything  
  
[Chorus]

Colin Zeal knows the value of mass appeal  
He's a pedestrian walker, he's a civil talker  
He's an affable man with a plausible plan  
Keeps his eye on the news, keeps his future in hand  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
While sitting in traffic, Colin thinks in automatic  
He's an immaculate dresser, he's your common aggressor  
He's a modern retard with a love of bombast  
Keeps his eye on the news, doesn't dwells on the past  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's so pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
(He's a modern retard, he's terminal lard  
He's an affable man, with a carrotene tan  
Because Colin Zeal's ill  
Colin Zeal's ill  
Colin Zeal's ill)  
  
Cause Colin Zeal knows

I don't understand  
You're walking all over me  
All over me to you  
Well you must be mad  
And you know you are  
You should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
  
So why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
Why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
  
Inside my head  
There's nothing left  
It's all been taken out  
Been taken out by you  
Do I care?  
Well you know I do  
You should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
  
So it's been said  
And you know it all  
Then you should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
For you  
  
So why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
Why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?

Primal, evil what am I  
Tongue-tied 'til the day I die  
There's no love made mermaids  
It's just distraction or so they  
  
And I'm too tired to care about it  
Can't you see this in my face, my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?  
  
It's a sorry state you're getting in  
The same excuse is wearing thin  
There's no self control left in me  
What was not will never will be  
  
And I'm too tired to care about it  
Can't you see this in my face, my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?  
(Or am I just coping?)  
  
And I'm too tired to care about it  
Can't you see this in my face  
The emphisis on coping  
Can't you see this in my face, my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again? (x2)  
(Can I be dreaming? Or am I just coping?)

(And so the story begins)  
City dweller, successful fella  
Thought to himself  
Oops I've got a lot of money  
I'm caught in a rat race terminally  
I'm a professional cynic  
But my heart's not in it  
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit  
Caught up in the century's anxiety  
It preys on him, he's getting thin  
  
Now he lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
Watching afternoon repeats  
And the food he eats in the country  
He takes all manner of pills  
And piles up analyst bills in the country  
It's like an animal farm,  
Lots of rural charm in the country  
  
Now he's got morning glory, and life's a different story  
Everything going Jackanory  
In touch with his own mortality  
He's reading Balzac, knocking back Prozac,  
It's a helping hand  
That makes you feel wonderfully bland  
Oh, it's the century's remedy for the faint at heart,  
A new start  
  
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
He's got a fog in his chest  
So he needs a lot of rest in the country  
He doesn't drink smoke laugh  
He takes herbal baths in the country  
Oh, it's like an animal farm  
But you'll come to no harm in the country  
  
Blow blow me out I am so sad I don't know why.

Yeah I found nowhere  
It got to know me  
Let me sleep all day  
Spent the money  
I haven't felt my legs  
Since the summer  
And I don't call my friends  
Forgot the numbers  
  
VIP 223  
Have my chances  
They have me  
Now stay up nights  
Watch TV  
I'm a country sad  
I'm a ballad man  
  
I'm on a come back roll  
Yeah I'm a bizzard  
And in my motor home  
Sweat on my pillow all night  
  
VIP 223  
Have my chances  
They have me  
Now stay up nights  
Watch TV  
I'm a country sad  
I'm a ballad man

They think you're clever ?cos you've blown up your lungs  
  
But I love to hear that crazy beat (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

There is a flower within my heart  
Daisy, Daisy  
Planted one day by a glancing Dad  
Planted by daisy bell  
Whether she loves me or loves me not  
Sometimes it's hard to tell  
Yet I am longing to share the lot  
A beautiful daisy bell  
  
Chorus:  
Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do  
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you  
It won't be a stylish marraige  
I can't afford the carriage  
But you look sweet upon the street  
On a bicycle built for two  
  
We will go tandem as man and wife  
Daisy, Daisy  
Peddling our way down the road of life  
I and my daisy bell  
When the roads and we both dispise  
Please men the lambs as well  
There are bright lights in those dasling ice  
A beautiful daisy bell  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I'll stand by you in wear or well Daisy, Daisy  
You'll be the bell we'll try to rip you know  
Sweet little daisy bell, You'll take the lead in each trip we take  
And if I dropped out, I will say here's the drink by beautiful daisy bell  
  
Repeat chorus (x2)  
  
But you look sweet upon the street  
On a bicycle built for two  
On a bicycle built for two  
On a bicycle built for two  
For two, For two, For two, For two

She says there's ants in the carpet  
Dirty little monsters  
Eating all the morsels  
Picking up the rubbish  
Give her effervescence  
She needs a little sparkle  
Good morning TV  
You're looking so healthy  
  
[Chorus]  
We all say  
Don't want to be alone  
We wear the same clothes  
Cause we feel the same  
We kiss with dry lips  
When we say goodnight  
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special  
  
Sex on the TV  
Everybody's at it  
The mind gets dirty  
As you get closer to thirty  
He gives her a cuddle  
They're glowing in a huddle  
Good night TV  
You're all made up  
And you're looking like me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you eat her yes you can  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, end of a century, oh, it's nothing special

The weekend is back  
But so is he  
Head to the floodlights  
See the fraternity  
They are waiting  
I hear them up in the north  
And down in the south  
And all that is spewing  
Spewing out of his mouth  
  
Entertain me  
  
At his and hers dating  
Bored minds agree  
Requirements to be stated  
Replies awaited  
She wants a loose fit  
He wants instant whip  
He guesstimates her arrival  
Will she want it really badly  
  
Entertain me  
  
A car, a house, both in a street  
The boredom of the sober week  
The weekend's here, hip hip hooray  
To make the blues just go away  
  
Entertain me

I remember thinking murder in the car  
Watching dogs somersault  
Through sprinkles on tiny laws  
I remember the graffiti, we are your children  
Coming in with spray cans of paint  
I remember the sunset and the plains of cement  
And the way the nights seems to turn the color  
of orangeade  
  
In this town cellular phones are hot with thieves  
In this town we all go to terminal pubs  
It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life  
From this town the English Army grind  
Their teeth to glass  
You'll get kicked tonight  
Smell of puke and piss  
Smell of puke and piss on your stilettos  
  
Here comes the panic attack  
My heart stops then starts  
Give me a drink  
I'll drink your round  
I'll take you round the pole  
It's cold up here  
You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city  
Either way, you'll catch the flu  
Or you'll catch the city  

It's pointless to explain why  
There's nothing I can say  
My words would all be meaningless  
Anyway  
It seems I can't be trusted  
And I don't disagree  
What made you think I ever really  
Wanted to be?  
I can't explain why  
And I don't know when  
I'm ever going to want to  
See her again  
Son don't ask why I came here  
There's nothing I can say  
I don't think I'll be staying very long  
Anyway  
I'm trying to find out why  
I came here at all  
I don't think it was to see you  
After all

I got the licence  
I got dirty knees  
I've been swinging in trees  
A paid up member  
I've been eating fleas  
Running naked in the breeze  
Catatonia itch  
Catalonia stitch  
Oh, I've been running for miles  
I start to tingle from my head to my toes  
Oh, tomorrow it's a taint on the nose  
Hetty hetty hetty hetty oh it's a taint on the nose  
  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah get out of cities, return to
the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees  
  
She's in a sort of a capital freeze  
Cos the petrol's done a whole lot for me  
Catatonia itch  
Catalonia stitch  
Pray tomorrow is it-chy itchy itch  
Go to yourself on your map  
  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah get out of cities, return to
the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, and return to the trees  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, and return to the trees

Who maddest one on the M1  
Who hasn't stopped sucking his thumb  
Who very straight and never grins  
Who cares what car he's driving in  
  
He is because he saw it on a commercial break  
And if he doesn't get what  
He wants then he'll get a headache  
Because he needs it, wants it, almost loves it  
He's here on his own, on globe alone  
  
Who joined health club to glisten  
Into hi-fi precision  
Whose mobile phone gives him the bone  
Who very keen on Sharon Stone  
  
Who only eats at the new brasserie  
Who only ever gets merry  
Who wouldn't be seen at bedtime  
Without putting Calvin Kleins on

[Intro]  
Uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh,  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm gettin' sad alone, dancing with myself  
Greedy go-getter goal, the luxury of stealth  
I'm seedy and the whole, dancing with myself  
I get into my bed, I do it to myself  
  
[Chorus]  
To the local, to the lo-o-o, I go out  
To the local, by myself  
To the local  
  
[Verse 2]  
I did it to my head, there's nothing to be addressed now  
There's nothing to get up about, cause we do it all the time  
The shepherd is undone, she done it all again  
I get ready to go, the greed go-getter con  
  
[Chorus 2]  
He going to the local oohh  
He going to the local oohh  
He going to the lo-o-cal oohh  
He going to the lo-o-cal oohh  
  
[Verse 3]  
To many western men, it's a problem left undone  
Imperious the sign, the papers of luxury  
A greedy go-getter in the skybox, she run alone  
She get ready to go, she does it with herself  
  
She does it with herself  
She does it with herself  
She does it on her own  
She does it on her own  
  
Uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh  
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

Waiting, I got no town to hide in  
The country's got a hold of my soul  
TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head  
And you seem very beautiful to me  
  
Sleeping but my works not done  
I could be lying on an atom bomb  
I'll take care  
Cause I know you'll be there  
You seem very beautiful to me  
  
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling  
Picture in my pocket looks like you  
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling, rolling, rolling along  

I'm alive and I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can float up here  
so soft and tingling  
You can't catch me  
I'm floating away  
  
I woke up  
And went down next door  
I'm getting up with nothing on my mind  
I went down the stairs  
With a pain in my head  
I should have never got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that mattered [Repeat: x 2]  
Aha  
  
I'm alive I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can fall down there  
Right into you your mind  
Don't put it around  
You can't catch me  
And carried away  
  
I woke up I, woke up every day  
There's nothing, nothing to say  
Half way down the stairs  
I feel a pain in my chest  
I should never have got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that it mattered [Repeat: x 2]  
Aha  
  
I'm alive, I'm can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
Half way down the stairs  
I get a pain in my chest  
I should never got out of bed  
  
I should never ever ever  
I should never...

I love the aspects of another city  
The representatives are alright  
In circulation the snake and the tiger  
Waking up and shaving in industrial life  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing  
  
I love the aspects of another city  
It's got your number and your blood type  
They been intentious so need some focus  
The apparitions of another prodigal night, right?  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a high score  
Something out of nothing  
  
I broadcast  
  
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing

Feeling daft beyond gone bland  
Made it to the goal on lense  
President, he just got hair down below  
Tomorrow never more...  
Made it to the BCP  
Everybody knows it's me  
I got up another sand,  
The guilty cell  
Tomorrow never more...  
  
I Got The Law (x23)  
  
Feeling Dove beyond con-pen (Convict Penitentiary)  
Nobody can take it there  
Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone  
Tomorrow never more...  
Tomorrow never more...

What you want to be is what I am  
How you want to feel is how I feel  
But nothing stays the same when I am here  
Just waiting for it all to disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know, I know it'll come between us  
I know, I know  
  
I'd like to get into that pretty head  
Just to see, to see if you are dead  
And it would amuse me just to see how  
How you feel about me and this crowd  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What you want to be is what I am  
How you want to feel is how I feel  
But nothing stays the same when I am here  
Just waiting for it all to disappear  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Verse 1:  
  
I look at her  
Just to see  
Is there anything in there  
For me  
If you look at her  
Do you see  
Is there anything in there  
For me  
  
Chorus:  
  
I love her  
I love love her  
She don't care if I live or die  
That is why  
I love her  
  
Verse 2:  
  
So don't talk to me  
Don't talk to me  
There's so little I can say when I  
Feel this way  
So don't talk to me  
Don't talk to me  
There's very little I can sey when I  
Feel this way  
  
Chorus:  
  
I love her  
I love love her  
She don't care if I live or die  
That is why  
I love her  
I love love her  
She don't care if I live or die  
That is why  
I love her(x2)  
I love love her  
She don't care if I live or die  
That is why  
I love her  
I love love her  
She don't care if I live or die  
That is why  
I love her(x4)

I wish the music would play by itself  
Shredded fingers - no ideas  
  
I wish this rainy day could be the last  
Could the world end - what a God send  
  
I wish I could stop wishing you were here  
But I don't want to - cos I still want you  
  
I wish I didn't feel so flippin mad  
Don't wanna scare you - just wanna love you  
  
I wish my life could last a thousand years  
Then I'd be clever - and build a heaven  
  
I wish I could bring nick drake back to life  
He'd understand - hold my hat band  
  
I wish a constant stream of happy shit  
Live forever - in world of leather  
  
I wish the rain would just leave me alone  
I can't wear that - stupid rain hat  
  
I wish I was in californ-i-a  
Perno perfurme - in the danube  
  
I wish the thing of love meant just one thing  
Cinderella - salmonella

Wake up, Maggie,  
I think I got something to say to you.  
It's late September and  
I really should be back at school.  
I know I keep you amused,  
But I feel I'm being used.  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone.  
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.  
  
The morning sun, when it's in your face,  
Really shows your age.  
But that don't worry me none.  
In my eyes, you're everything.  
I laughed at all of your jokes.  
My love you didn't need to coax.  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone.  
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.  
  
All I needed was a friend  
To lend a guiding hand.  
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!  
You wore me out.  
All you did was wreck my bed,  
And, in the morning, kick me in the head  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.  
You led me away from home  
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.  
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.  
  
I suppose I could collect my books  
And get on back to school.  
Or steal my daddy's cue  
And make a living out of playing pool.  
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band  
That needs a helping hand.  
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.  
You made a first-class fool out of me.  
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.  
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.

Bill Barret has a simple dream  
He calls it his plan b  
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar free  
And everyone is very friendly  
Plan b arrived on a holiday  
Took a cab to the shopping malls  
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore  
Then found love on channel 44  
  
[Chorus]  
La la la la la he wants to go to magic america  
La la la la la he'd like to live in magic america  
With all the magic people  
  
Bill barrett sent his postcards home  
To everyone he'd ever known they read  
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal  
From the people who care how you feel  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
With all the magic people

I was angry with my friend  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
I told it not, my wrath did grow  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smile  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And it grew both day and night  
Till it bore an apple bright  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine  
And into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole  
In the morning, glad, I see  
My foe outstretched beneath the tree  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
I was angry with my friend  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
I told it not, my wrath did grow  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smile  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie

I left my street  
I'm a guillotine  
Pulling away  
In my machine,  
Where have I been, now?  
Not you  
  
Shooting stars in my left arm  
An alcohol low  
Giving away time to Casio  
Sun is slow  
I got soul  
  
Is this where I'm going to  
We'll see  
We'll see  
We'll see  
  
I kill this sleep  
I'm the man in the moon  
Walking on sand on my home high noon  
In love with the moon, love you  
  
Cause I lift my Street  
I'm a guillotine  
Pull it away  
In my machine  
Forget where I've been before  
Forget you  
  
Is this where I'm going to  
We'll see  
We'll see  
We'll see  

Miss America sits in the shower  
She's plucking hours from the sky  
Picks up the telephone, into another home  
Don't ask me why  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind at all  
I love only you  
  
She's a well wisher and she wishes you well  
Wish away, wish away  
She no jellybean, she a Jemima ho ho  
Wish away, wish away  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind at all  
I love only you  
  
Here is here and I am here, where are you?  
Far away, far away  
She no jellybean, she a Jemima ho ho  
Wish away, wish away  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind at all  
I love only you

Oh, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
Why do you bore me  
Until my heart stands still  
  
Then you confuse me  
That makes me hateful  
When I get hateful  
I say stupid things about you  
  
All those things I know about you  
Oh, it's the strangest feeling to know  
There are a billion people just like you  
Feeling like you in their own way, they're...  
  
Just as mixed up as you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Poor little mixed up you  
And all those things  
  
I said about you  
I take them back  
I eat my words  
I didn't mean them  
  
I mean so little  
I'm so fickle  
I forget you  
I forget you  
  
Oh, it's the strangest feeling to know  
There are a billion people just like you  
Feeling like you  
And in their own way, they're...  
  
Just as mixed up as you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Poor little mixed up you  
Oh, it's the strangest feeling to know  
  
There are a billion people just like you  
They all feel like you  
And in their own way, they're just as...  
Da da da da da da da da

It's automatic  
I need to unload  
Under the pressure  
Gone middle of the road  
Fall into fashion  
Fall out again  
We stick together  
'Cause it never ends  
  
Here comes a low  
I'm a boy and you're a girl  
Here comes a high  
The only ones in the world  
Here comes everything  
You and me can work it out  
Here it comes  
You, me, we'll work it out!  
  
Here comes tomorrow  
1 2 3 episodes  
We stick together  
Gone middle of the road  
'Cause that's entertainment  
It's the sound of the wheel  
It rolls on forever  
You know how good it feels  
  
Here comes a low  
I'm a boy and you're a girl  
Here comes a high

At the music heist  
I met the gourmet man  
With aluminum lungs  
Sucks all we can  
  
Seek the whole world go flip  
In a stunt bug style  
With a cellulite pile  
But he can smile  
  
This is the music  
And we're movin' on, movin' on  
  
We're sticky eyes and sticky bones  
You get no time on your own  
You get a dose and get a ghost  
You get it coast to coast  
Dye your hair black  
Get Satan tattooed on your back  
Pierce yourself with a coke can  
Put yourself in fake tan now you're in a band  
  
Cause this is the music  
And we're movin' on, movin' on  
Hey, this is the music  
And we're movin' on, movin' on  
No matter how low, there's always further to go  
We're movin' on, movin' on  
  
We're movin' on, it won't be long  
We're movin' on, it won't be long  

Mr Briggs is on holiday  
But he stays in his room  
He's too cold to go out for his evening smoke  
The lady down the hallway  
Is deaf and dumb to what you say  
She's too busy dreaming of chihuahua dog  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere  
Mr Briggs needs sleep now  
He's been up for a week  
He can hear a buzz buzz buzzing in his head  
He has a three-bar heater  
But it can't keep him warm  
If he bought another then he'd have three more  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere  
Mr Briggs while on holiday  
Never left his bed  
Walked around in circles but only in his head  
The lady down the hallway  
Is running out of pills  
She could pull herself together but she knows she never will  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere

Oh, Mr Robinson  
And his quango  
Dirty dealer  
Expensive car  
Runs the buses and the Evening Star  
He got a hairpiece  
Ooh, he got herpes  
His private life is very discreet  
A nicer man, no, you're never gonna meet  
  
He's the self-confessed saviour of the dim right wing  
He got respiratory problems and a mason's ring  
  
Oh, Mr Robinson  
And his quango  
Drinks with generals and county wives  
The family business is doing alright  
They're doing tangos  
Down in the quangos  
He makes them tick  
Ooh, he makes them tock  
And if you don't fit  
He put you in the dock  
  
He just sits in his leather chair and twiddles his thumb  
Gets his secretary in and pinches her bum  
He ran into the toilets in the town hall  
He got his biro out and wrote on the wall  
"I'm wearing black French knickers under my suit  
I've got stocking and suspenders on  
I'm feeling rather loose"  
  
Ooh, I'm a naughty boy  
Ooh, I'm a naughty, naughty boy

Please excuse, my tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
You don't understand  
It takes me wherever I want to go  
  
This is surely what I need  
But I don't always think that way  
And in the end  
I can't help feeling  
  
I must sober into this  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me  
  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me, down on me  
Please excuse  
  
My tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
But in my mind  
There's nothing that really  
  
Ever holds us from the truth  
So I build My Ark for you  
And I hope you do the same for me  
In the end, I can't feeling  
  
Just a sobering end to this  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me  
  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me, down on me

Oi!

You let yourself down and you don't know why  
But you've? ?? ?

And you push push push push

It's over  
You don't need to tell me  
I hope you're with someone who makes you  
feel safe in your sleeping tonight  
I won't kill myself, trying to stay in your life

When you see me  
Please turn your back and walk away  
I don't want to see you  
Cause I know the dreams that you keep is wearing me  
When your coming down, think of me here  
I got no distance left to run

I hope you're with someone who makes you feel  
That this life is the night  
And it settles down, stays around  
Spends more time with you  
I got no distance left to run

Gary Golf stops all the clocks  
With night nurse slippers and socks  
He tries to keep this thoughts clean  
By washing with Listerine  
A little peck on the cheek  
In dazed pajamas and sheets  
Keep the light on, I'm not tired  
I want to read my Dick Francis  
Dirty Frauleins and nasty Nazis  
There are no monsters in me  
  
Car alarms letting off steam  
Gary hears them in his dreams  
Panic outside is seeping in  
Just easy-listening to him  
Turns in his sleep and smiles to himself  
There are no monsters in me  
Cause Garry's out on the Green  
No growing pains for him  
Gary Golf Ball Eyes is not in

Lead in me and me in water  
Dangling in my world  
I swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
It's oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright  
  
My heads is full of suspicion  
I'm coming home sometime  
I've swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
It's oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright

Don't start me talking, I could talk all night  
My mind goes sleepwalking while I'm putting the world to rights  
Called careers information, have you got yourself an occupation?  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today  
  
There was a checkpoint Charlie, he didn't crack a smile  
But it's no laughing party when you've been on the murder mile  
Only takes one itchy trigger  
One more widow, one less white nigger  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today  
  
Hong Kong is up for grabs, London is full of Arabs  
You could be in Palestine, overrun by the Chinese line  
With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne  
  
But there's no danger, it's a professional career  
Though it could be arranged with just a word in Mr Churchill's ear  
If you're out of luck and out of work  
We could send you to Johannesburg  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today (x4)

On my way to the club  
I fell down a hole  
All the people there  
Said you come alone  
And I, I just want to be, darling with you  
The music's made that way  
My eyes aren't blue  
There's nothing I can do  
  
So I stayed in the club  
Just rewarding myself  
Happiness could turn into something else  
And I just wanna be, darling with you  
The music's made that way  
My eyes aren't blue, there's nothing I can do

Holy man tiptoed his way across the Ganges  
The sound of magic music in his ears  
Videoed by a bus load of tourists  
Shinny shell suits and drinking lemonade  
Now I got a funny feeling  
Which I bought mail order  
From a man in a teepee in California  
Said he once was a great game show performer  
Then he blew all his money away  
Blew it all away  
  
So take me home  
Don't leave alone  
I'm not that good  
But I'm not that bad  
No psycho killer  
Hooligan gorilla  
I dream to riot  
Oh you should try it  
I'll eat parole get gold card soul  
My joy of life is on a roll  
And we'll all be the same in the end  
  
Then you're on your own  
  
Well we go happy day glow in the discos  
The sound of magic music in our brains  
Someone stumbles to the bathroom  
with the horrors  
Says lord give me time for I've jumped into space  
I'm in outer space  
  
So take me home  
Don't leave alone  
I'm not that good  
But I'm not that bad  
No psycho killer  
Hooligan gorilla  
I dream to riot  
Oh you should try it  
I'll eat parole get gold card soul  
My joy of life is on a roll  
And we'll all be the same in the end  

Honi soit qui mal why pense  
Wo kann offen etwa sonst  
Dos cervezas, por favor  
Zu heisen, yes doch  
Ha ha, sir, et paradis,  
Jacqueteure, au secours, mon taille  
Europa is a OK, hola why el puerto?  
  
Ba ba ba ba [Repeat: x3]  
People in Europa  
  
Ciao ciao bella, Monaco  
Bon voyage in Sverige  
Kom nu med, vi far dricka manana  
Honi soit qui mal why pense,  
Wo kann etwa sonst  
Dos cervezas, por favor,

Hello Peter Panic  
You've landed on our planet  
What a strange thing you are  
With little pissy eyes  
You got in the television  
Turned us all old and wizened  
Then disappeared  
To a distant star  
And we remember you as  
Peter Panic  
Who lives forever  
Peter Panic  
As light as a feather  
And he says it's ok  
When you blow him away  
He'll be back for you some other day  
When you're running out of sugar  
He left his secret with the chemist  
Who made it taste very pleasant  
Now everyone  
Has gone to his star  
Happy to be with...  
Peter Panic  
Who lives forever  
Peter Panic  
As light as a feather  
And he says it's ok  
When you blow him away  
He'll be back for you some other day  
When you're running out of sugar  
And he says it's ok  
When you blow him away  
He'll be back for you some other day  
(When you're running out of sugar)

A fervoured image of another world  
Is nothing in particular now  
And imitation comes naturally  
But I never really stopped to think how  
And everyone is a clever clone  
A chrome coloured clone am I  
So in the abscence of a way of life  
Just repeat this again and again...and again  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Popscene, all right  
  
I'm leaving town to run away  
Right into your twisted arms  
No queues and there's no panic there  
Just dangling your feet in the grass  
My lack of natural luster now  
Seems to be losing me friends  
So in the abscence of a way of life  
Just repeat this again and again, and again  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Popscene!  
  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Popscene, all right  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Hey, hey come out tonight  
Popscene!

Only the magical transit children,  
sing, sing the lullaby, bah bah bah.  
Sitting on the pavement, sucking on a long straw.  
It's colorful, it's colorful, but it washes you out.  
  
Here is my violence, and here is the excuse.  
I learned it all, but only second hand.  
Falling into walls, well what is it with you.  
You never know, never know, never know.  
  
[Chorus]  
We planned it all this way  
We planned it all this way  
Pressure on Julian.  
  
Swimming in yellow pissy water.  
Sand getting in between their ears.  
No blood in head in this bloddy weather.  
Irate people with yellow tounges.  
  
Only the magical transit children,  
sing, sing the lullaby, bah bah bah.  
Falling into walls, well what is it with you.  
You never know, never know, never know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(There was pressure on Julian, pushing trolleys in the car park, from B to A,  
then back to B. Pressure on Julian, he keeps passing out,  
Poor, precious little snout, the birds are singing at night.  
Pressure on Julian)  
  
[Chorus]

Alright (Ready)  
  
Rollin'?  
Rollin', rollin', rollin'?  
Yea, are we?  
Rollin', rollin'... howdy boys  
  
  
  
O.K. I want y'all to sit real comfy...with yer real comfy ten gallons on the
back of yer head...just relax. O.K.  
(It's good to be here) Here we go...boys...aaa  
  
I'm a truckin' redneck and I just refuse to die  
(He won't die)  
I was built big and strong on the state's best apple pie  
I'm better than them limey pin-heads in Europe-why  
12 gauge in their back, hell would stop their mopin'  
I'm a truckin' red stop and I...just refuse to die  
  
Graham, you will never die  
That's what I call chemistry  
  
You're American...you're never gonna die!  
You play billiards and wet that mound, you ain't never gonna die!  
The good Lord above will take care of that  
  
I get free coffee fill-ups at my favourite Denny's place  
Find a couple of tea bags and I kick them in the face  
Sure is damn good thumpage in that waitress' ass  
When I go on tour gonna get me a pass  
Hell, don't want no fuckin' limey gettin'...on my goddamn case  
  
Woo!  
That's in the east of the wood...you gotta go to the wood and go east  
It's in the east of the wood  
  
Go west brother!  
We showed them in Jim Sum  
  
Any of my, uh, the boys here want to say something to audience at home ?  
  
Well, you know, you've grown up and I obviously haven't  
  
Woo! Hope you go on happy with your Miller's Coors Light  
  
I've got every Beatles record

It's up to you  
You know it is  
I can't convince you  
All you have to do is  
Slow down  
  
I've always said  
It will never change  
All you have to do  
Just you be you  
I think that's all I want to say  
  
All these things  
That I told you  
I didn't mean at all  
I didn't mean at all  
I'd forget you  
  
So if you come here  
If you come here  
All you have to do  
Just you be you  
I think that's all I want to say to you

St. Louis song  
Something is wrong  
I kill that man  
From your own shoulders down  
And here comes an empty  
People look at each other like me  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
'Cause there's nothing  
Here to be  
  
St. Louis song  
Where has the good thing gone  
Dreaming himself to hell  
Stuck in his good cell  
He's still trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
  
I'm not trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here

All I want to be is washed out by the sea  
No death star over me  
Won't give me any peace  
All I want is light relief  
Put the crazies on the street  
Give them guns and feed them meat  
Now shoot the death star down  
Dig a hole and put it down  
Thousand miles underground  
  
They say it's no game  
There's strange news from another star  
I'm lost, I'm lost  
There's strange news from another star  
  
Give me all your stuff  
Until I can't get up  
Watch the whole world freeze  
Counting tin can in our sleep  
Submarines are diving deep  
I don't believe in me  
I don't believe in me  
All I've ever done is tame  
Will you love me all the same  
Will you love me though  
Always the same  
  
They say it's no game  
There's strange news from another star  
I'm lost, I'm lost  
There's strange news from another star

You think we look pretty good together  
You think my shoes are made of leather  
  
But I'm a substitute for another guy  
I look pretty tall but my heels are high  
The simple things you see are all complicated  
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, Yeah  
  
Substitute your lies for fact  
(Substitute) I can see right through your plastic mac  
(Substitute) I look all white, but my dad was black  
(Substitute) my fine looking suit is really made out of sack  
  
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth  
The north side of my town faced east, and the east faces south  
  
And now you dare to look me in the eye  
Those crocodile tears are what you cry  
It's a genuine problem that you won't try  
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by  
  
Substitute me for him  
(Substitute) my coke for gin  
(Substitute) you for my mum  
(Substitute) at least I'll get my washing done

Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire  
You read the color supplement, the TV guide  
You dream of protein on a plate  
Regret you left it quite so late  
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep  
Oh, the Sunday sleep  
  
Sunday, Sunday here again, a walk in the park  
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past  
He fought for us in two world wars  
And says the England he knew is no more  
He sings the Songs of Praise every week but always falls asleep  
For the Sunday sleep  
  
You dream of protein on a plate  
Regret you left it quite so late  
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep  
And Mother's Pride is your epithet  
That extra slice you will soon regret  
So going out is your best bet  
Then bingo yourself to sleep  
Oh, the Sunday sleep

Gimme good times  
Gimme soul life  
Give me fever  
I'm a believer  
Give me anything  
Gimme space brain Gimme music, gimme love  
I've never seen love  
  
Gimme good times (I want to be with you,  
Let me jump high and all I want is you)  
Gimme easy breathing  
Give me everything, everything, everything  
  
Gimme good times  
Oh, gimme soul life  
Give me fever  
I'm a believer  
Give me anything ? (I want to be with you,  
Gimme space brain and all I want is you)  
Don't leave me ever  
We'll live forever  
(yes we will, I know we will)  
  
Oh, gimme good times  
Gimme soul lifes  
Gimme fever  
I'm a believer  
You know I am  
Give me anything ? (I want to be with you,  
And gimme space brain and all I want is you)  
Gimme music, give me love  
I've never seen love  
Stick it in my brain [Repeat: x3]

What am I to do  
Someone here is really not happy  
Put myself on a line  
It seems I never got through to you  
So I wean myself off slowly  
  
I'm a darkened soul  
My streets all pop music and gold  
Our lives are on TV  
You switch off and try to sleep  
People get so lonely  
  
I believe I believe I believe  
Everything's out to sea  
I believe I believe I believe I believe  
That is the way it should be  
I hope you feel the same  
  
Everyone is dying  
Stop crying now here comes the sun  
I didn't mean to hurt you no no no  
It takes time to see what you have done  
So I wean myself off slowly  
  
I believe I believe I believe  
Love is the only one  
I deceive I deceive I deceive I deceive  
Cos' I'm not that strong  
Hope you feel the same  
  
And now it seems that we're falling apart  
But I hope I see the good in you come back again  
I just believed in you  

Disguise this morning  
Airplane passes  
At the slight angle  
Second one follows  
Reaching no evidence  
Continues to baffle her  
But she's not stupid  
She's just friendly  
I don't know what to do  
Today is up to you  
Can I pass through you?  
Tame, tame, tame, tame  
Applause in background  
Their coffee mornings  
They show Bonanzas and  
What to buy there  
So taste of horrors in  
Oh well city's hot  
You fall to pieces when  
I must be dreaming  
I don't know what to do  
Today is up to you  
Can I pass through you?  
And I don't know what to do  
My absence is due  
Can I pass, can I?

Tell me, tell me, tell me please  
What is this that hovers me it's  
Driving me to a state of hopeless  
Having any sex at all  
Hasn't any worth at all  
Or is it just enough to bitch  
  
The funny thing that makes me do  
The things that I do to you  
Oh I know they are so damn very tall  
I'm in a state I can't explain  
My mind is gone, my mind is gone  
It seems so very little I can do  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me, tell me, tell me please [Repeat: x3]  
Won't you tell me please  
  
I'm so full of emptiness  
It's so hard to sustain the mess  
I've no idea who I am at all  
So tell me, tell me, tell me please  
What is this that hovers me  
Before I smash my head against the wall  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Tender is the night  
Lying by your side  
Tender is the touch  
Of someone that you love too much  
Tender is the day  
The demons go away  
Lord I need to find  
Someone who can heal my mind  
  
Come on, Come on, Come on  
Get through it

Love's the greatest thing

The ghost I love the most  
Hiding from the sun  
Waiting for the night to come  
Tender is my heart  
I'm screwing up my life  
Lord I need to find  
Someone who can heal my mind  
  
Come on, Come on, Come on  
Get through it  
Come on, Come on, Come on  
Love's the greatest thing

Oh my baby  
Oh my baby  
Oh why  
Oh my  
Oh my baby  
Oh my baby  
Oh why  
Oh my  

I saw you today  
You were too far away  
It had hurt me to say  
Hurt me to say  
The words  
The words I have to say  
  
There ain't no sound  
When you're not around  
And it gets me down  
Yeah it gets me down  
My life feels so brown  
  
I just want to be with you  
That's all I wanna do  
X2  
  
Inside my brain  
It's just not the same  
Cos it started to rain  
It's started to rain.  
  
I just want to be with you  
That's all I wanna do  
X2

All good people your time will come  
Work forever and still not be done  
Close your tired eyes, no one knows you've gone  
It's not forever but today you've become  
The man who left himself  
  
Don't belong here, your heart beats too fast  
Feel the mis-beat, it starts and stops  
Don't be frightened, these things never last  
Maybe tomorrow your time will have passed  
It's the man who left himself

What if I told you I love you  
What if I called you in rhythm  
In this world there's nothing left  
Well nothing that's new  
  
What if I told you without  
Loving is simply a lie  
Although she moves into the night  
Oh, tell me you're mine  
Please say it's true  
  
Oh, shame it's over  
I was the light and the days of them all  
Well push me over  
I'm flat on my back but I'm having a ball  
And just look whose laughing  
  
What if I flew like a dove dear  
What if I would you in rhythm  
There's nothing left  
Nothing that's good left for me now  
  
Oh,I'll just go and sleep with strangers  
I'll live like a lord in a tower  
'cause in the city there's too mich air  
That I can't dream at night  
Well not anymore  
  
Oh, shame it's over  
It been such fun and we had a ball  
Well push me over  
But I'll be the last people to fall  
Well just look whose laughing  
  
Oh shame it's over  
How like a cow bloated on grass  
Well, push me over  
Me on my back and you on your arse  
Such a shame it's all over  
There are so feel days left to grasp  
So push me over  
We on our back and you on your lazy arse  
Well just look whose laughing

You're taking the fun out of everything  
You're making me run, when I don't want to think  
You're taking the fun out of everything  
I don't want to think at all  
  
[Chorus]  
There's no other way  
There's no other way  
All that you can do is watch them play  
  
You're taking the fun out of everything  
You're making it clear, when I don't want to think  
You're taking me up, when I don't want to go up anymore  
I'm just watching it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll watch you play  
I'll watch you play  
  
[Chorus]

And into the sea goes pretty England and me  
Around the bay of Biscay and back for tea  
Hit traffic on the dogger bank  
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank  
Sail on by with the tide and go to sleep  
And the radio says  
  
[Chorus]  
This is a low  
But it won't hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
Finding ways to stay solo  
  
On the tyne forth and cramity  
There's a low in the high forties  
And Saturday's locked away on the pier  
Not fast enough dear  
And on the malin head, black pool looks blue and red  
And the queen, she's gone round the bend  
Jumped off land's end  
And the radio says  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is a low  
But it wont hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
This is a low  
But it wont hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
Finding ways to stay solo

The time has come  
Not to be cautious  
You must be careful no to make mistakes  
For every heart flower  
In twenty four  
  
An operation froze  
Faster than they did yesterday  
And the landing right on your side  
They won't be much of a problem  
  
Then passed smith  
There is a rise  
When everybodies asleep at home  
He becomes nervous  
And sees a change  
Today in future  
  
Oh la la oh la la oh la la  
Watch the markets move from the screen  
In a pocket in a grey flannel suit  
Re tomorrow's cash today  
And check your pulse  
  
Waste metals crawling to the kerb  
And softs dropped in a summer term  
Sugars melted in the mouth  
Of a broken home  
If we knew a better option  
  
She sleeps for while  
And it could be long time before he thinks again  
And then he looks at the papers and looks again  
Today futures  
  
Oh la la oh la la oh la la oh la la  
Today futures  
Futures futures futures [repeat the fade]

Fist out  
Fist out for the five  
Fist out  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Don't sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
  
Fist out  
Fist out for the five  
Fist out  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Don't sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones

Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, kazoo kazoo every time  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)  
Anyway you choose, anyway you choose at all  
Sometimes you get too much, some days it all gets too much  
  
Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, why do you turn your back on me?  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)  
Anyway you choose, anyway you choose at all  
Some days you do too much, some days it all gets too much  
  
Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, kazoo kazoo every time  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)

For coughs and colds and scabby holes  
Itchy pimples, unseemly moles  
For funny turns and Chinese burns  
For aching heads we're most concerned  
For staying lively, getting it nightly  
This we guarantee  
That Ultranol is the new remedy  
Before you go to bed take two or three  
When you wake up you'll feel better  
For aches and pains and jellied brains  
Help you sleep and smile again  
Nouw you're aimless, blameless, almost nameless  
You get much more although you pay less  
Revitalise that sexual drive  
In fact, be born again  
Yes Ultranol will put you on the map  
Take four or five then have a little nap  
When you wake up you'll feel better  
For your coughs and scabby holes  
Keep you young although you're feeling old  
If you're not protected you're going to get is  
So suck 'em and see, you won't regret it  
Suck 'em and see

Wassail, wassail all over the town  
Our toast it is white and our ale it is brown  
Our bowl it is made of the white maple tree  
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee  
So here is to Cherry and to his right cheek  
Pray God send our master a good piece of beef  
And a good piece of beef that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee  
And here is to Dobbin and to his right eye  
Pray God send our master a good Christmas pie  
A good Christmas pie that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee  
So here is to Broad Mary and to her broad horn  
May God send our master a good crop of corn  
And a good crop of corn that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee  
And here is to Fillpail and to her left ear  
Pray God send our master a happy New Year  
And a happy New Year as e'er he did see  
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee  
And here is to Colly and to her long tail  
Pray God send our master he never may fail  
A bowl of strong beer! I pray you draw near  
And our jolly wassail it's then you shall hear  
Come butler, come fill us a bowl of the best  
Then we hope that your soul in heaven may rest  
But if you do draw us a bowl of the small  
Then down shall go butler, bowl and all  
Then here's to the maid in the lily white smock  
Who tripped to the door and slipped back the lock  
Who tripped to the door and pulled back the pin  
For to let these jolly wassailers in

Every time I come here  
I'm not sure what to say  
I know it should be easy  
But it never seems that way  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
  
I can't say I love you easily  
But you wouldn't want me to  
So I'd rather just say nothing  
And leave it up to you  
  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as small as me  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as foolish as me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]

Where'd you go?  
Dark eyed traveller  
I almost feel you breathe  
Where'd you go?  
Dark eyed traveller  
Can you even hear me speak?  
  
You make things bright  
When they took the night away  
Led me inside and kissed all my tears away  
Said you were here to stay  
  
Where'd you go?  
In the morning  
When I was way down with dream  
Where'd you go?  
In the morning  
When fever pulled me down stream  
You made things bright  
And you took the night away  
Lend me your eyes and show me a brand new way  
Now I just feel dead today.

Friday's child is planning to out for the first time  
Says "Don't worry Mum, I won't be out that late"  
Can't be playing those passive games right now, they're out of date  
You're awfully sweet, haven't got the time  
Growing up so fast, got better things to do  
You can get what you want, you're so young and lovely  
  
Oh, oh, la, la, la  
  
Kicking around the center of the town lookin' through shop windows  
Those mannequins look far too real at night  
Friday's child doesn't know if it's awake or if it's dreaming  
Says "Don't worry Dad, I'll do my bit, I'll raise the flag  
I'll be just like you"  
  
"Don't worry Mum, I'm not that dumb, I'll be just like you"

Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Sleeping really late  
Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Not feeling so great  
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns  
Sad, drunk, and poorly  
Dogs digging up the ground  
  
And I feel the light  
In the night and in the day  
And I feel the light  
When the sky's just mud and grey  
And I feel the light  
When you tell me it's OK  
Cos you're so great, and I love you  
  
Tea Tea and coffee  
Helps to start the day  
Tea Tea and coffee  
Shaking all the way  
City's alive and, surprise, so am I  
Tea, tea and coffee  
Get no sleep today  
  
And I feel the light  
In the night and in the day  
And I feel the light  
When the sky's just mud and grey  
And I feel the light  
When you tell me it's OK  
Cos you're so great, and I love you
