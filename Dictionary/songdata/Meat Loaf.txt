If you listen, to the night  
You can hear the darkness call  
I can barely stand to wait  
I can barely stand at all  
C'mon closer to me now  
It's like we're sharing the same skin  
We gotta get out of this jail  
We gotta let the future in  
So many things in your life  
That your bound to regret  
Why didn't I do that?  
Why didn't I do this?  
So many chances you lost  
That you'll never forget  
Why didn't I make it?  
Why didn't I take it right there?  
The loneliest words you'll ever know  
If only-if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me. it could have been me  
The loneliest words you'll ever know  
If only-if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me. it could have been me  
You'll have to pay for it later  
If you don't get it when it's going for free  
Believe me -! believe me -!  
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
It's something that's always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
You're gonna show me that you already know  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
You shouldn't tremble when we touch  
There's no reason for these fears  
It's a promise that was made  
We've been promised this for years  
I wanna show you it all  
What to do and where and how!  
Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now  
We'll never be as young as we are right now!  
  
So many cries in the night  
That you try to ignore  
Why didn't I do this?  
Why didn't I do that?  
So many unanswered prayers  
So many unopened doors  
Why didn't I take it?  
Why didn't I make it come true?  
The loneliest words you'll ever know:  
If only - if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
The loneliest words you'll ever- know:  
If only - if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
You'll have to pay for it later:  
If you don't get it when it's going for free!  
Believe me! believe me, believe me!  
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
It's something that has always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
I'm gonna show you that you already know...  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than, you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste

I'm not afraid to show you who I am  
And I am not ashamed of my life  
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road  
I've always felt you deep in my bones  
  
With every step I rise and fall  
With everything to gain I end up losing it all  
When the darkness gets in  
I scream out and your light sets me free  
  
I'm not afraid of the past no more  
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good  
I used to dance to the devil's beat  
If I could bust into hell I would  
  
I'm not afraid to shed all my skin  
I'm not afraid of the faults you see  
I'm tearing down these walls right now  
They're comin' down 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
I'm not afraid when they kick me down  
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed  
I'm not afraid if I live or die  
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
And I wish that I could give you something in return  
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned  
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned  
  
And in the end you'll finally see  
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can  
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need  
  
I'm not afraid of the the truth no more  
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid  
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins  
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did  
  
I'm not afraid of the things you know  
I'm just a book for the world to read  
My final words on the final page  
Will be amends 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat...

If it takes them so long, so long to say yes, why don't they just say no  
We don't need anyone to be put to the test, why don't they let us be  
  
[Chorus]  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
We needed a plan, we needed defences, they couldn't raise a smile  
As the world looked down, they raided our senses, there can be no reconcile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
There was a time in our life was taken for granted, it'll never come again  
Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted, they put it all to the flame  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down

All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray  
I went for a walk on a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
  
Stopped in to a church, I passed along the way  
Well, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)  
And I began to pray (I began to pray)  
You know the preacher likes the cold (preacher likes the cold)  
He knows that I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)  
Oh now, California dreamin' (California dreamin) on such a winter's day,  
Oh yeah  
  
All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)  
And the sky is gray (and the sky is gray)  
I went for a walk (I went for a walk)  
On a winter's day (on a winter's day)  
If I didn't tell her, I could leave today  
Oh now, California dreamin' (I thought you went away)  
Oh now, California dreamin' (on such a winter's)  
Oh now, California dreamin' (California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
  
(Dreamin') oh now, California dreamin'  
(Such a winter's day) oh now, California dreamin'  
(Cali-for-ni-a, thought the sky was grey)  
California dreamin'  
(Such a winter's day)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin', dreamin')  
And the sky is gray  
And the skies are gray

You see me now as large as life, but underneath you knew all too well  
The hollow shell, no spark of life  
Where once upon a time there beat a heart  
For you and you knew it from the start, and you went and blew it all away  
And you knew how, oh you knew best  
The strings to pull and buttons to press  
To wind me up and make me shake, you controlling every move I made  
I couldn't see through it, all the pain, and you put me through it  
Over and over again, just tell me over and over and over  
  
[Chorus]  
How could you say there was no other, why is it nothing's what it seems  
You told me I'm your greatest lover, do you even know what that word means  
Your lovin' is coolin', baby who ya think you're foolin'  
'cause when I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
When I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
Stop it! Stop it! Don't you say a word  
I feel my hands around her neck and everything went blurred  
Broken, broken, she slipped from out my hands  
She lay so still and lifeless, I cried baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)  
  
It was my dumb luck, I just came unstuck  
My whole world shook, I'd had about enough  
When I woke up, I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)

Another night sleepless  
I don't want to feel this  
Nothing can stop this pain  
Trying to get to a time I forget you  
Still tangled in yesterday  
It's so easy for you  
To give nothing for me  
Did you ever feel anything?  
I want you to cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
I want you to cry over, die over me  
Baby, just for one time  
I want your heart broken  
Some sign of emotion  
Wanna to see the tears tumble down  
Show me I meant something  
And that you feel nothing  
But your world crashing to the ground  
It's so easy for you  
To forget about me  
Did I ever mean anything?  
I want you to cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
I want you to cry over, die over me  
Baby, just for one time  
Cry, cry, cry  
But did you feel something?  
Did we mean nothing at all?  
I want you to cry over, cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
Even for a moment  
Oh, why can't you just cry over, die over me  
Baby, why can't you hurt like I do  
Like I hurt over you  
Can't you cry over, die over me  
Baby, just for one time  
I want you to cry over, die over me  
Baby, want you to fall on your knees  
Baby, crawl back to me  
Want you to cry over, die over me  
Baby, just one time  
Cry, cry, cry  

Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Say a prayer and light a candle  
Toll a bell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like hell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Storm the castle, stem the tide  
Rise above yourself  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like hell

Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar  
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car  
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do  
But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew  
  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
  
I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk  
  
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
  
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
  
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
  
You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
  
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low  
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go  
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action  
  
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint  
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point  
  
You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dead ringer for love  
  
[Repeat: x12]  
Dead ringer for love, dead ringer

So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got, then find  
You've already changed your mind  
  
And this is what it sounds like  
Crying on the bed that we both made  
Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me  
Any kind of sign  
  
I don't want to be here wide-awake  
Clinging to a love that can't be saved  
Hanging off the edge of every word  
That you say  
  
So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?"  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes"  
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
  
And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side  
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I need someone to call my own  
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes  
And begging you, "come home."  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride  
  
So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?"  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes"  
But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
But I said that  
  
And I wish I could take it all back  
  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I want a love to call my own  
I want to take you in the back seat now  
And slowly drive you home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're  
Choking on your pride  
I don't want to be this wide-awake  
  
Fighting for a love that I can't save  
And hanging off the edge of every word you say  
Knowing that it might make me cry  
I don't want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting  
I stumbled on "I love you" tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if  
Would have been a matter of fact  
  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it  
Would have been a matter of fact  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll feed your desire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll stand by your side  
Did I say that?  
This time I will be your pride  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
And I wish that I could take it all back  
  
So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got then find  
That you've already changed your mind

I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes  
Like a little girl I once knew  
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street  
You walk with me, and I walk with you  
  
Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense  
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again  
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again  
And it just can't be, like it was once before  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
(No, I never could turn away from you)  
  
[Chorus]

I stare in the mirror, my eyes refuse to blink  
Sympathy for me, hell I can't even think  
Send for the iceman, my temperature is startin' to rise  
I've heard it before 'n I know the truth from the lies  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it any wonder heaven's racked with thunder  
And all of my dreams go under like the fallin' rain  
Execution day, execution day (execution day, execution day) execution day  
Execution day  
  
Voices like locusts keep smothering me  
Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea  
Don't touch me now, won't let you crucify me  
You ain't no damn jury, you can't pass no sentence on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whose blood on whose hands, where's the promises they preached for this land  
Standin' there with bibles clutched in their hand  
Whose blood on whose hands, whose blood on whose hands  
(Whose blood, whose hands)  
  
Execution day, execution day  
  
Father my hands are shakin', I see the light, it's breakin'  
Show me the way to set my soul free, I hope it rains on me  
Let it rain on me  
  
Execution day, execution day

I took one look and something snapped inside,  
I said I love your eyes  
You took my heart, you took my breath away,  
I felt my temperature rise  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
Falling into somebody else's arms  
  
I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise  
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,  
you had me hypnotized  
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much  
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me  
To love and to comfort you  
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air  
I'll be there  
  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay  
  
[Chorus]

She thought she had the only key  
She thought you only opened up to her, well you see  
I don't know why you call it love  
She thought she was the brightest light  
But someone else was lighting up your life, what I think  
I don't know why you call it love  
  
I'm not suspicious, no not me, but I'm not blind  
And I'd have to be not to see  
  
[Chorus]  
Gettin' away with murder, you can love a girl and hurt her  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
You can tell a girl you love her, while you're working on another  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
  
You have had to love and run  
Two in the hand has left you holding none, and I don't  
I don't know how you call it love, no, no  
  
You're not demanding, no not you, you're understanding  
You do what you want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said she was the only one, but you were cheating all along  
There ought to be a law for what you've done  
  
I got to save you from yourself, I got to stop you from hurtin' someone else  
  
[Chorus]

When the wind is howling through your window pane  
It's not the only pain of the night  
Your burning up in your bed, you gotta fever of love  
And there's not an antibody insight  
Hey jenny, jenny why are you crying  
There's a beauty of a moon in the sky  
But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life  
You never lift your head and look so high  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Sombody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
  
When the sweat is sizzling  
On you skin in the dark  
And your desperate now for somewhere to turn  
  
Every muscle's in rebellion  
Every nerve is on edge  
And every limb is being erotically burned  
  
Hey johnny, johnny why are you shaking?  
When a boy should do whatever he can  
You've been nothing but an angel  
Every day of your life and now you wonder what it's like to be bad  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you've been wanting to feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
  
Every time I try and dream you  
I can't believe how hard it's been to  
Conjure up your face and trace your body in the air  
All the seconds go on forever  
But the thirds and the forth ones are even better  
And every time I do it just a little bit longer  
Every time I dream, it's just a little bit stronger than  
Real life  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere

Heaven can wait  
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart  
Will take me through the lonely night  
Through the cold of the day  
And I know  
I know  
Heaven can wait  
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me  
And the melody's gonna make me fly  
Without pain  
Without fear  
Give me all of your dreams  
And let me go along on your way  
Give me all of your prayers to sing  
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day  
I got a taste of paradise  
I'm never gonna let it slip away  
I got a taste of paradise  
It's all I really need to make me stay  
Just like a child again  
  
Heaven can wait  
And all I got is time until the end of time  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
  
And I know that I've been released  
But I don't know to where  
And nobody's gonna tell me know  
And I don't really care  
No no no  
I got a taste of paradise  
That's all I really need to make me stay  
I got a taste of paradise  
If I had it any sooner you know  
You know I never would have run away from my home  
  
Heaven can wait  
And all I got is time until the end of time  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
  
Heaven can wait  
Heaven can wait  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
Let the altars shine

I know you're goin'.  
I know this is good-bye.  
And I can't make you stay.  
No matter no matter how I try.  
But ooh if you're leaving.  
Please grant this one request.  
And leave my heart with some happiness.  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna bold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
  
  
If I can't be with you.  
Oh baby all my life.  
The next best thing.  
Is you next to me all through the night.  
  
  
Pull all the shades down.  
Put your heart next to mine.  
Tonight give me a chance.  
To feel heaven just one more time.  
And ooh if you're leaving.  
Honey I'll set you free.  
Just leave my arms this one sweet memory.  
  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna hold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
  
  
If I can't be with you.  
Ooh baby all my life.  
The next best thing.  
Is you next to me all through the night.  
  
  
If this is the last kiss.  
Let's make it last all night.  
If this is the last time I'm ever, ever gonna hold you.  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light.  
  
  
If this is the last time.  
Ooh we'll ever be together.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
Kiss me and baby give me something.  
Tender to remember you by.  
Baby give me something, tender to remember you by.

You say you're all alone,  
And after all the changes you've been through today  
You can use a little tenderness, right now  
  
OK, I've been alone,  
And I can understand the way you feel tonight  
Maybe together we can charge it all right now  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, I'd love to hold you  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
You say, he broke your heart,  
He left you crying, but he did not set you free  
And now you feel like you can never love again  
  
OK, so let me know,  
It's up to you how long you let his memory stay  
And do you really want to carry on this way  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, I'd love to hold you  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to,  
Then I really can't deny you  
  
So many things you need to know, so many left to say  
But you mean more than words I know,  
I can help you chase the pain away  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
If you really want to, if you really want to,  
Then I really can't deny you  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to  
If you really want to

Look at them now  
What do they want?  
And what do they do now?  
Nothing at all!  
  
What do they know?  
What do they think?  
And who do they tell?  
Well, no one at all!  
  
Lives are truly meaningless  
And we are busy being blessed  
  
With that we can take and pocket  
No one needs to know  
We're is the plug and they're the socket  
Give us the juice and we'll go  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
How do they sleep?  
Their lives are so tart  
Bring me the trash collectors  
'Cause they're nothing but trash  
  
What do you expect?  
They've got no standards  
So we lower the bar  
'Cause they're waiting for us  
  
We'll open up Pandora's Box  
Pandora gave her keys and locks  
  
They're the big dogs waiting for their mother  
Come to the confessional  
So I can tell you all to bugger off  
There's no time like now!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the market-place sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king...  
  
And we'll do it our way  
It's our time to play  
We know what to say  
They stand in our way  
Don't stand in our way  
No time like today  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the anthems we sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the animals sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
  
Can't you hear the choir now?  
Listen to the chosen ones sing!  
Can't you hear the slaughterhouse bells?  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!

And I never really sleep anymore  
And I always get those dangerous dreams  
And I never get a minute of peace  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
Maybe it's nothing and I'm under the weather  
Maybe it's just one of those bugs going round  
Maybe I'm under a spell and it's magic  
Maybe there's a witch doctor with an office in town  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
And there used to be such an easy way of living  
And there used to be every hope in the world  
And I used to get everything that I went after  
But there never used to be this girl  
No there never used to be this girl  
  
Maybe I'm crazy and I'm losing my senses  
Maybe I'm possessed by a spirit or such  
Maybe I'm desperate and I got no defenses  
Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch?  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
There was a time when nothing ever really mattered  
There was a time when there was nothing I didn't know  
There was a time when I knew just what I was living for  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
And I never really sleep anymore

There were nights when the wind was so cold  
That my body froze in bed  
If I just listened to it  
Right outside the window  
  
There were days when the sun was so cruel  
That all the tears turned to dust  
And I just knew my eyes were  
Drying up forever  
  
I finished crying in the instant that you left  
And I can't remember where or when or how  
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  
  
But when you touch me like this  
And you hold me like that  
I just have to admit  
That it's all coming back to me  
When I touch you like this  
And I hold you like that  
It's so hard to believe but  
It's all coming back to me  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things I'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than any laws allow  
Baby Baby  
  
If I kiss you like this  
And if you whisper like that  
It was lost long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you want me like this  
And if you need me like that  
It was dead long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
It's so hard to resist  
And it's all coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  
But it's all coming back  
  
There were those empty threats and hollow lies  
And whenever you tried to hurt me  
I just hurt you even worse  
And so much deeper  
  
There were hours that just went on for days  
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances  
That were lost to us forever  
  
But you were history with the slamming of the door  
And I made myself so strong again somehow  
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  
  
But if I touch you like this  
And if you kiss me like that  
It was so long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you touch me like this  
And if I kiss you like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things we'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  
Baby, Baby, Baby  
  
When you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
Then we see what we want to see  
All coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  
  
If you forgive me all this  
If I forgive you all that  
We forgive and forget  
And it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
We see just what we want to see  
Al coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now  
  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when you kiss me like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when I touch you like that  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
If you do it like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)

Another New York waltz at four a.m.,  
In the canyons lost at night  
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls  
And I'm riding through this darkness,  
'cause I know there's life within  
And I'm searching through the shadows,  
Just to find that light again  
  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Let the meter run  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Oh the night's not really done  
  
Keep driving  
  
And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air  
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets,  
But I know I'll find you there  
And oh Lord, you look so pretty,  
But you can see it in my eyes  
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
It seems so real until the light turns green  
  
Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene  
  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
They don't tell you when the music stops,  
Or how the movie ends  
Is it too late once the feeling's gone,  
To back it up and start it all again?  
  
Oh Lord you look so pretty,  
And you can see it in my eyes  
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
  
(Keep driving) keep driving, driving  
  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
(Keep driving) let the meter run,  
(keep driving) don't take me home  
  
(Keep driving) ooh, the night's still young  
  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) ooh find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) find someone,  
(keep driving) find someone,  
(Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving)

Well, I went home with the waitress  
You know the way I always do  
Well how was I to know  
She was with the Russians, too  
I was gambling in Havana  
You know I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Daddy, won't you get me out of this  
I'm an innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck  
Between a rock and a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck  
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck  
Oh baby, I'm down on my luck  
I'm so far down, I don't think I'll ever get up  
If it weren't for bad luck  
Oh if it weren't for bad luck  
I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Now I'm stranded in Honduras  
I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Get me out of this  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
You know the shit has hit the fan  
  

You don't need to sneak in the door just come on in to the room  
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone  
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you  
There's been no reason to move, it's been as still as a tomb  
I needed you oh so badly tonight but I guess you had better things to do  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock  
Now it's a quarter to 3.  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
Whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!  
But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock  
Now it's a quarter to 3.  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
  
But down in my soul - down in my soul I know  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!  
But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again

I want my money back  
I want my money back  
It's all or nothing  
  
And nothing's all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
It's always something  
There's always something going wrong  
That's the only guarantee  
That's what this is all about  
  
It's a never ending attack  
Everything's a lie, and that's a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
And all the morons  
And all the stooges with their coins  
They're the ones who make the rules  
It's not a game, it's just a rout  
  
There's desperation  
There's desperation in the air  
It leaves a stain on all your clothes  
And no detergant gets it out  
  
And we're always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movie's over, fade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
What about love?  
It's defective!  
It's always breaking in half  
  
What about sex?!  
It's defective!  
It's never built to really last  
  
What about your family?  
It's defective!  
All the batteries are shot  
  
What about your friends?  
They're defective!  
All the parts are out of stock  
  
What about hope?  
It's defective!  
It's corroded and decayed  
  
What about faith?  
It's defective!  
It's tattered and it's frayed  
  
What about your Gods?  
They're defective!  
They forgot the warranty  
  
What about your town?  
It's defective!  
It's a dead end street to me  
  
What about your school?  
It's defective!  
It's a pack of useless lies  
  
What about your work?  
It's defective!  
It's a crock and then you die  
  
What about your childhood?  
It's defective!  
It's dead and buried in the past  
  
What about your future?  
It's defective!  
And you can shove it up your ass!!  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
It's all or nothing  
And nothing's all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
It's a never ending attack  
Everything's a lie, and that's a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
And we're always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movie's over-fade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!

Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner, and all around the world  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around, all around the world  
  
It doesn't matter where they're going  
Or wherever they've been  
'Cause they've got one thing in common, it's true  
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste  
  
And let me tell ya' something, neither will you  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
  
We've gotta' fast, we were born out of time  
Born out of time and alone  
And we'll never be as young as we are right now  
Runnin' away and runnin' for home  
Runnin' for home  
  
It doesn't matter where they're going  
Or wherever they've been  
'Cause they've got one thing in common, it's true  
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste  
And let me tell ya' something, neither will you  
  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner, and all around the world  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around, and all around the world

I sit in my living room thinking of you  
And the feelings I fear are coming true  
And everything about you is wrong I know it  
But I still taste you on my tongue  
And I still breath you in my lungs  
And I wish I could stop breaking down  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
  
It's 7:00am and I just want to call you  
And tell you I'm falling in love  
But, there's somebody else inside these four walls  
If she smells you on my skin  
I can't let her know where I've been  
I wish I could be with you now  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
Don't tell them anything  
And I won't let you go  
  
Don't say a word  
Don't tell a soul  
And I shiver at the thought of you  
I can't believe that you love me too  
And we quiver when we touch  
I can't believe I love you so much  
And I hate it when you walk away  
I know we can't go on this way  
But there's magic when we touch  
I can't believe I love you so much  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
Don't tell them anything  
And I won't let you go  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud

Up in the shadows where the skeletons hide  
We all live in fear of the door and what's behind  
A door you dare not open, 'cause what you'll find  
A close encounter of the sexual kind  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Batten down, baby, lock all doors  
You've got the love that I'm coming for  
Your hait's so straight, I can make it curl  
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking, it here's to the magic  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking it, here's to the magic  
  
Pull up the blankets, you won't hear a sound  
The pounding's like thunder when it shakes the ground  
You got a hunger only I can feed  
You try to fight it off but you're in too deep  
Love in the shadows, love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Heat, flame, embers- it can be magical  
Heat, flame, embers- smoking, smoking  
[Repeats 2x]  
  
Fire keeps burning up,  
Fire keeps burning

I'm so afraid to draw you close  
Hold me  
Before my hands fall away  
I'll suffocate  
If I can't breathe you in  
And hold you there  
Forever  
  
I left a message at the hotel  
They said you checked out  
They said you ain't coming back  
I tried to call you  
But you turned off your cell  
And it said at the tone  
Just leave me alone  
  
And I fall apart at the seams  
It seems that I always, always fall apart  
But as strong as I am  
Why can't I break your heart?  
  
I remember how it used to be  
Making love to you all night long  
I used to take you in my arms  
And hold you there until all my strength was gone  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
  
I built this prison that I thought was a home  
And we both lived here  
Guess you were living alone  
I'd tear it down if you would only have asked  
And I would build you a bridge  
So you could come back  
  
And I fall apart at the seams  
It seems that I always, always fall apart  
But as strong as I am  
Why can't I break your heart?  
  
I remember how it used to be  
Making love to you all night long  
I used to take you in my arms  
And hold you there until all your fears were gone  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
Hey, now tell me why can't you just break my heart?  
I used to be an man of steel  
And I used to take you in my arms  
I loved you from the start  
Now you can't tear my world apart  
  
I used to be a man of steel  
Now every bit of faith is gone  
You used to be so strong  
Now you can't even break my heart  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to take you in my arms  
What's it going to take for us to break down?  
And finally fall  
Apart at the seams  
It seems that I always fall apart  
As strong as you are...  
As strong as I am...  
Why can't you break my heart?

Operator number please.  
It's been so many years.  
And she'll remember my old voice.  
While I fight the tears.  
Hello, hello there is this Martha?  
This is old tom frost.  
And I am calling long distance.  
Don't worry about the cost.  
It's been 40 years or more.  
Now Martha please recall.  
And meet me out for coffee.  
Where we'll talk about it all.  
And those were days of roses.  
Poetry and prose and Martha.  
And all I had was you and all you had was me.  
And there was no tomorrow's.  
As we packed away our sorrows.  
And we saved it for a rainy day.  
And I feel so much older now.  
And you're much older too.  
Oh how's the husband how's the kids?  
You know that I got married too!  
Oh lucky that ya found someone.  
To make ya feel secure.  
Oh cause we were all so young and foolish.  
And now we are mature.  
And those were days of roses.  
Poetry and prose and Martha.  
And all I had was you and all you had was me.  
And there was no tomorrow's.  
As we packed away our sorrows.  
And we saved it for a rainy day.  
And I was so impulsive.  
I guess that I still am.  
But all that really mattered then.  
Was that I was a man.  
I guess that our being together.  
Was never meant to be.  
Oh but Martha, Martha I love you.  
Can't you see.  
And those were days of roses.  
Poetry and prose and Martha.  
And all I had was you and all you had was me.  
And there was no tomorrow's.  
As we packed away our sorrows.  
And we saved it for a rainy day.  
And I remember quiet evenings.  
Trembling close to you.

(This is one of the neighbors from down the street.  
This record of this music has been goin' on all afternoon  
and I'm sick and tired of it. If it doesn't stop I'm calling the police!)  
  
You got me on the run, you got it your way  
Now I'm feeling pretty good and I'm beginning to sweat  
Your love is so fine, it's got me feelin' alright  
Going out of my mind, I got to have you tonight  
  
The girl's so deep inside, like blood in my veins  
Never lets me hide, now I'm going insane  
It makes me climb the walls, bite my nails to the bone  
It's always by my side, it never leaves me alone  
  
[Chorus]  
When it's time to get tough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
Masculine  
  
I know that I'm a man from the spark in my soul  
It can make me so hot, you got out of control  
Grab her by the hair, drag her back to your cave  
It's what makes a man a man, people always stay the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm masculine  
  
(Masculine, masculine)  
  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway, in the heat of the night and in the dark of the day  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway  
  
When it's time to get tough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine - what d'you say?  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine  
  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
If you push me I'll shove, I'm masculine  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine...

If I had money  
Tell you what I'd do  
I'd go downtown  
Buy a Mercury or two  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Oh I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
Well, I had me a girl  
Stole her from a friend  
Friend got lucky  
Stole her back again  
  
Cause she thought he had a Mercury  
Oh she thought he had a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
C'mon!!  
  
Well, hey now mama  
Lookin' so fine  
Cruisin' round  
In your Mercury 69  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Ooo, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
My girl went out  
Didn't stay long  
Bought herself a Mercury  
And cruised it on home  
  
Cause she know I have a Mercury  
Oh she know I have a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
Well, hey now mama  
Lookin' so fine  
Cruisin' round  
In your Mercury 69  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Ooo, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down  
  
I'm going out  
I'm gonna get me a real job  
And I'm gonna buy me some  
Mercury!! Yeah

Hey Ricky, now mine is empty, how about one for you  
We could sell it out together, seems tomorrow's overdue  
Captain Video, done went home, one pilot laid to rest  
And dragon ladies now talk that talk, about who loves who, who loves best  
Silver bullets in the jukebox, spin another round  
Everybody at the back of the line, it's midnight at the lost and found  
  
[Chorus]  
Midnight at the lost and found, lost souls in the hunting ground  
A remedy for all your ills, at the lost and found  
Midnight at the lost and found, midnight  
  
Have a double, it's gettin' late, you'll get home, just rely on fate  
Place just finally came alive, good old boys just arrived  
Stools keep changin' faces, and the night just slips away  
And like a long distance love affair, soon you've got to pay  
Silver bullets in the jukebox, spin another round  
Everybody at the back of the line, it's midnight at the lost and found  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hangin' on barely, hitch a ride away  
Belly up and bury, boy, all the hurt you feel today  
Hangin' on barely, hitch a ride away  
  
Belly up and bury, boy, all the hurt you feel today  
Silver bullets in the jukebox, spin another round  
Everybody get back in line, last call for the lost and found  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Once a beautiful Miss America married Mr. Right  
Had a little baby girl, born on a stormy night  
But that was once upon a time, now it's a brand new world  
  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new  
  
There's a break in the chain, a skip in the clock  
Girl that's where I'm gonna find you  
Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be  
There's a clash on the border, a flame in the sky  
Girl that's where you're gonna find me  
  
Can't you hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine  
Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens  
But you and I stand innocent, baby it's a brand new world  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl)  
  
We're the son and the daughter on a new freeway  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Laughin' while the road maps blow away  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
We're the son and the daughter and we ain't afraid  
  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Won't be makin' the mistakes our fathers made  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl  
  
Once a beautiful Miss America married Mr. Right  
Had a little baby boy, born on a stormy night  
But that was once upon a time, now it's a brand new world  
  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl

From the very first moment I saw you, I knew our love would be so strong  
And the very first moment I kissed you, I knew our joy would last so long  
And then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to
say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Won't you take some more, it's what you came for  
And don't mind me, I won't throw you no curves  
Have yourself a ball with my good woman  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
  
When I saw you hanging round the truck stop, shining like an angel in the
night  
And when I saw you crying like a baby, I knew you'd have to be my wife  
  
Then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
Now I think I'm gonna have to leave you  
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share  
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces  
The flavor that I crave is no longer there  
  
Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends  
I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends  
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said - listen here, group  
  
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve

The entire city is burning  
You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox  
Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests  
Barbarians prowl in shadows their heads rocking with rodents  
Motorcycles reproduce in nocturnal alleys  
Groaning with greasy pleasure  
And they've blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon  
And sent it out to sea full of screaming, lovely, lonely girls

Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
I can still see you standing there.  
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair.  
Kisses sweet in the salty air.  
When love was forever.  
Turn the page and we fade to blue.  
The scene has changed now I'm without you.  
Walked away when the act was through.  
And the dream was over.  
It was almost like a movie  
The way you said goodbye.  
You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
The greatest story was you and me.  
Had it all we had everything, but now the.  
Story's done it's just history.  
The last act is over.  
You every line had the sweetest sound.  
Your every touch turned my world around.  
But the light came up and my world crashed down.  
End of show  
It's over.  
It was almost like a movie.  
Those nights we touched the stars.  
Time stood still for you and I.  
Now it's sad enough to make you cry.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Act one  
The story's just begun.  
Act two  
I fell in love with you.  
Act three  
Knew it was meant to be.  
Act four  
You don't love me no more.  
And there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.

It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day  
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away  
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like  
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back  
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away  
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack  
We're breakin' away from the pack  
  
And if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And even if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly  
They're only fighting for the chance to be last  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
  
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast  
  
You shouldn't always see your world so clearly  
You shouldn't always know your place so well  
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell  
  
I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day  
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away  
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose  
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
[Chorus]

(Part one)  
At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming  
And the cars and the beast behind, they all start humming  
And ooh you got a cool machine, so let's get it runnin'  
We'll break the silence of the night  
And you know they're gonna hear us comin'  
We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk  
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark  
  
So baby one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
  
Artists got their easels, they're ready on the mark  
Gonna try and take the pictures  
Of the dust and the gold in the sparks  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
  
So just one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
I never wanna see you cry  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
  
(Part two)  
Ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready  
Under my foot gonna hit it down,  
Take this stance before the crowd  
Sleepin' city urban fall,  
Summer's sadness time to answer the call  
Cool machine, get it runnin', ready to roll  
Soft hands around my neck,  
One more kiss then it's time to connect  
Leave this child, leave me all alone,  
This one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
Ready, ready, ready to roll - this one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
  
(Part three)  
Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise  
Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
  
One more kiss, one more kiss, one more kiss, one more kiss  
One more kiss, one more kiss  
It brings a little luck, brings a little luck to the night  
One more kiss, one more kiss, Ooh one more kiss  
One more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'

Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
It's only two o'clock and the temperture's beginning to soar  
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead  
It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored  
And breathing is just no fun anymore  
And then I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
  
You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse  
The subways are steaming and the skin of the street is gleaming with sweat  
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside  
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost  
I think it's time for you to come inside  
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget  
I think it's time for you to come inside  
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget  
  
Come on! come on!  
And there'll be no turning back  
You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back  
Come on! come on!  
It's time to burn up the fuse  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
  
So wander down the ancient hallway  
Taking the stairs only one at a time  
Follow the sound of my heartbeat now  
I'm in the room at the top, you're at the end of the line  
Open the door and lay down on the bed  
The sun is just a ball of desire  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire!  
  
It's only two o'clock and the tempertures beginning to soar  
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead  
It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored  
And breathing is just no fun anymore  
And then I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
I saw you like a summer dream  
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said  
  
Come on! come on!  
And there'll be no turning back  
You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back  
Come on! come on!  
It's time to burn up the fuse  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
You've got nothing to do and even less to lose  
  
So wander down the ancient hallway  
Taking the stairs only one at a time  
Follow the sound of my heartbeat now

And I wanna take you out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
Out of the frying pan (and into the fire)  
  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire! fire! fire!  
And into the fire!

Every day of my life they say the same old thing  
Hey boy! Oh boy, you better wait for your turn  
And every day of my life I get the same old line  
Hey boy! Oh boy, when are you going to learn  
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green  
I want to go on all colors that I see in between  
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs  
I want to run all the way across a double white line  
  
But every day of my life I see the same old road  
Hey girl! Oh girl, we gotta pull up our routes  
And every day of my life I see the same old dream  
Hey girl! Oh girl, I need a dream I can use  
  
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green  
I want to go on all colors that I see in between  
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs  
  
My body is the car and my soul is the ignition  
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we  
  
[Chorus:]  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! We're sick and tired of waiting in line  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! Nobody's taking our time  
  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!  
  
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind  
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime  
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime  
  
And every night of my life there's something holding me back  
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, I know it's time to cut loose  
And every night of my life I dream of someone like you  
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, you got a dream I can use  
  
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind  
  
My body is the car and my soul is the ignition  
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we -  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Peel out!

Somewhere a red-eyes waitress glances at another movie magazine  
Down on the corner there's a grocery boy stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams  
Someone's cleanin' up the offices, one window burnin' in the dark  
Somebody's cryin' is there any way in hell  
To light a comet from a single spark  
Workin' so hard I can't remember much about the freedom I been workin' for  
Felt like a prisoner 'til I looked in your eyes  
And saw a million wide open doors  
Ya tell me put a little money away, well every dog will have his day in time  
Well I been slavin' like a dog and I got nothin' to show ya  
But a collar and a fist fulla nickels and dimes  
Chorus:  
I want a piece, a piece of the action, give me a shot at the real thing  
I want a piece of the action, a piece of the action  
Gonna turn on the master, gonna cut these strings  
Gonna turn on the master, gonna cut these strings  
Been livin' just like my old man did and neither once of us could get it right  
Punchin' in when the day begins and punchin' out the local boys at night  
There's someone leanin' on a peelin' porch  
And someone leavin' on a silver plane  
And I finally know the man I'd rather be  
Girl I won't be back to getcha 'til they know my name  
[Chorus:]  
They hand you a paycheck every week and steal a piece of your soul every day  
An' I don't need no gold watch in fifty years, baby let's be golden today  
(chorus repeats 2x...)  
(Solo)  
[Chorus:]  
Somewhere a red-eyes waitress glances at another movie magazine  
Down on the corner there's a grocery boy stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams

You like ridin' around with your big brother, in your uncle's custom van  
You want to bleach your hair so bad, but your mama don't understand  
Hangin' around by the monument, dancin' to the radio  
You got a memory even shorter than your dress  
But there's nothin' that you don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
Priscilla, Priscilla, nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid  
Priscilla, Priscilla, they're gonna kill ya for what you did  
  
Cuttin' class with a backstage pass, and always skippin' lunch  
Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys, and daddy's vodka in the punch  
Learned how to jump start your grandma's car, how to French inhale your Kools  
And now you know that breakin' hearts is easy as breakin' the rules  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You don't remember no revolution, you don't belong to no baby boom  
  
Just you and your headphones, dreamin' in your pink bedroom  
  
Strong girls break the records, and rich girls break their nails  
  
Smart girls always know by heart, what some girls always fail  
  
Bad little girls grow up to be good, and good girls finish last  
  
But crazy girls don't care how they grow up, as long as they grow up fast  
  
[Chorus]

I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say  
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or firey speech  
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play  
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away  
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world  
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks  
And everything's blank  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
If I could find the words then I would write it all down  
If I could only find a voice I would speak  
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight  
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep  
  
I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream  
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold  
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream  
  
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away  
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark  
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks, and everything's blank  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
It's running silent and angry and deep  
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say, c'mon and read 'em and weep  
  
Read 'em and weep, for all the hours we'll be spending alone  
Read 'em and weep, for the dreams we'll ignore  
Running silent and deep,  
And all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the magic that our bodies had made  
Read 'em and weep, for the blood that we lost  
Running silent and deep, and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed  
For whatever the cost  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the memories still alive in the bed  
Read 'em and weep, for the lies we believed  
Running silent and deep, and all the things that can never be said  
  
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep  
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep  
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
It's running silent and angry and deep  
It's here in my eyes and it's all I can say  
c'mon look at me and read 'em and weep

I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll, when it didn't cost a thing  
Stacks of scratched up 45's and taught myself how to sing  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, burnin' it up in a smoke filled club  
Givin' your soul to the world  
  
Chorus:  
  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, a soldier of fortune in the night  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, when the white hot lights cut through the night  
And the sound of the thunder starts roaring  
That's when you know what you're savin' it for  
And you're feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero  
  
I owe it all to rock 'n' roll, and I wouldn't want to change a thing  
Got this old guitar strapped round my neck, and my baby waitin' in the wings  
  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, a spark in your eyes  
A flame in your soul, givin' it all to the world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Yes you're feeling like, oh you're feeling like  
  
(chorus)  
  
(Like a rock 'n' roll hero, like a rock 'n' roll hero)

Madder than a mad man and bored to the core.  
Minute hand crawling can't take it any more.  
Future's up the highway, ya gotta get away.  
Gonna take a little trip and find a tijuana stray.  
  
Got the time to take it.  
Got the balls to break it.  
Gotta a car that it'll make it.  
South of the border,  
Don't drink the water.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have two tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Time bomb is tickin', my head's about to bust.  
Need your personal attention or I swear I'm gonna rust.  
Find a little place.  
No one will tell you what to do.  
Tell her I'm a rebel.  
She says.  
Yea without a clue.  
  
Just need some understanding.  
A girl who ain't demanding.  
Who ain't afraid to fake it.  
South of the border,  
Don't drink the water.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have two tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Need some understanding.  
A girl who ain't demanding.  
A little bad behavior.  
She's gonna be my saviour.  
My knees are shakin'.  
My back is breakin'.  
Oh mama mia A' senorita.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have three tequila.  
Love seeker.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
She ain't a teacher.  
She ain't a preacher.  
Just so close to holy.  
That you're runnin' just to reach her.  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light.  
Oh senorita.  
Have some tequila.  
Need sneakers.  
Lord the will is gettin' weaker.  
Gonna have a good time tonight.  
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light.  
Just heard the bell.  
That got me outta hell.  
Got a girl.  
I gotta life.

Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine  
Let me tell you fortune life that once was mine  
  
[Chorus]  
She was a special girl and she meant the world to me and I gave her everything  
  
When I found her, I'd been looking everywhere  
And when I lost her, I was lost beyond despair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dreams are hard to touch, could it be I love her too much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bottom line is she was fine in every way  
And it's not with hesitation that I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dreams they come and go, but thoughts, like love, will always grow

The waves are poundin' on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it feel so right  
I know I'm ready and I'll never be like this again  
And the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail  
I know you're ready and we're runnin' on the back of the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
And my body is burnin' like a naked wire  
I want to turn on the juice, I want to fall in the fire  
I'm gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea  
I'm gonna give you what I'm hopin' you'll be givin' to me  
And when the waves are poundin' on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it good and make it right  
Now the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail  
  
How hard, how hard, how hard do I gotta try (I want all of your love)  
Surf's up (I need it so bad), surf's up (I need it so bad)  
Surf's up and so am I (I gotta give you some love)  
Surf's up and so am I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surf's up and so am I, surf's up and so am I

Listen  
I was born on the other side  
Just always looking to you  
I made it over the great divide  
Now I'm coming for you  
  
Your forces lined up in battle  
Your soldiers and your machines  
The sun been blacked out by shadows  
The darkest hour now you've ever seen  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
I rose up on the doctor's slab  
Like Lazarus from the pit  
And everyone wants to take a stab  
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit  
  
I've been held up on money  
I've been beaten out of spite  
You want a piece of me honey?  
Lose or win  
  
You know you've been in a fight  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell  
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the  
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too  
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the  
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,  
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it  
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.  
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than  
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So  
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew  
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings  
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and  
Tear him down.  
  
Now there ain't much difference  
Between a bridge and a wall  
Without me right in the middle baby  
You'll be nothing at all  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
Try and tear me down

Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny  
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site  
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road  
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify  
  
I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie  
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight  
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before  
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify  
  
On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night  
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight  
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow  
And a sweet young thing called out my name  
And this is how it goes, she says...  
"Go boy, can you hear them?  
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?"  
And I got down on my knees  
  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down  
Up from the ground and I testify  
  
Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide  
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside  
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore  
You've got to walk before you run  
See the night before dawn  
Before you pull yourself off the floor  
  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify

I've been living my life in a cage  
Freedom spits in my face  
It was such a disgrace  
And I was lonely  
And feeling empty  
Desperate  
  
I had my head in a noose  
I had nothing to loose  
Had enough of abuse  
And now I'm dangerous  
Hateful, contagious  
It haunts us  
  
I'm angry (I'm angry)  
I'm raging (I'm raging)  
I'm breaking through the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
The monsters loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove you can take it  
To the top before you fall  
  
I've walked a slippery road  
Felt a twitch in my soul  
Through the wind and the cold  
With no protection  
Just one direction  
Destruction  
  
I've paid for all my mistakes  
Taking all I can take  
Until I'm ready to break  
I'm feeling vicious  
And so outrageous  
It breaks us  
  
I'm leaving  
Still breathing  
I'm tearing through these chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've lived a thousand years in darkness  
Banished all alone  
Inside my mind with just my madness  
Behind these walls of stone  
  
I was falling apart at the seams  
Holding my breath just to breathe  
I tasted the sting of my tears  
  
I was waking up stuck in a dream  
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed  
Wasted away by my fears  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove that you can take it  
To the top and never fall  
  
The monster's loose  
You've lost your last excuse  
Now show me that you got it  
Even when you fall  
  
The monster's loose  
This game is win or loose  
Sometimes you gotta' do it  
And show the world you want it all

I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind  
I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh, and on across Caroline  
I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle, halfway across Alabama  
And that 'Hound broke down and left me all stranded in Downtown Birmingham  
  
Right away I bought me a through train ticket, ridin' across Mississippi clean  
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smokin' into New Orleans  
  
Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston Town  
There are people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let a poor boy down  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit, they put luggage in my hand  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land  
  
Workin' on a T-bone steak, I had a party flyin' over to the Golden State  
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
He would get us at the Terminal zone  
  
Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone  
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone  
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'  
And the poor boy's on the line  
  
Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone  
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone  
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'  
And the poor boy's on the line  
  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'  
And their big boy's on the line

Baby we can talk all night  
But that ain't gettin us nowhere  
I told you everything I possibly can  
There's nothing left inside of here  
And maybe you can cry all night  
But that'll never change the way I feel  
The snow is really piling up outside  
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here  
I poured it on and I poured it out  
I tried to show you just how much I care  
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout  
But you've been cold to me so long  
I'm crying icicles instead of tears  
  
And all I can do is keep on telling you  
I want you, I need you  
But-there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
  
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach  
You'll never drill for oil on a city street  
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks  
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom  
Of a Cracker Jack box  
  
I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not  
No matter how I try  
I'll never be able to give you something  
Something that I just haven't got  
There's only one girl I'll ever love  
And that was so many years ago  
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart  
She never loved me back  
Oh I know  
  
I remember how she left me on a stormy night  
She kissed me and got out of our bed  
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door  
She packed her bags and turned right away  
  
And she kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
I want you, I need you  
  
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
I want you, I need you  
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
Baby we can talk all night  
But that ain't getting us nowhere

Wasted Youth  
Wasted Youth  
I remember everything!  
I remember everything little thing, as if it happened yesterday  
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny
angel  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy  
  
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords  
And the precise angle from which to strike!  
  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berry's  
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
But it rung out beautifully  
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before  
  
So I took my guitar  
And I smashed it against the wall  
I smashed it against the floor  
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader  
Smashed it against the hood of a car  
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson  
The Harley howled in pain  
The guitar howled in heat  
  
And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom  
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight  
Slowly I opened the door  
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed  
I raised the guitar high above my head  
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of
the bed  
My father woke up, screaming "Stop!"  
"Wait a minute. Stop it boy. What do you think your doing?"  
"That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument"  
And I said, "God Damn It daddy,"  
"You know I love you, But you've got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n'
Roll"

[Boy:]  
There's a hole in the sky tonight  
Did the moon drift too far from sight?  
I would search through this empty darkness  
To see your face in the morning light  
  
We've been lost in a sea of confusion  
Got caught up in a selfish illusion  
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break  
Don't let fate make the choice for us  
  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?  
  
[Girl:]  
Once in a lifetime you'll find someone heaven send for you  
For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe  
In a love that's meant to be  
  
[Boy:]  
It feels like we've fallen from grace  
Given up on the higher thing  
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find  
Something to give us wings  
  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it?  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?  
  
[Boy:]  
I can't go on another day  
Comin' home and seeing you cryin'  
[Girl:]  
Can't stand another night  
Of telling you I'm fine when I'm dying  
  
[Both:]  
Forever means nothing  
To live without you  
Is reaching for something that never comes through  
Together is heaven  
Apart we're in hell  
The time for forgiveness is now  
  
Once in a lifetime you'll find  
Someone to share your dreams  
For a lifetime  
Our love will always set us free  
Forever we'll believe...  
  
[Boy:]  
I can't forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin  
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime  
  
[Girl:]  
On a summernight's surrender with nothing to loose  
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime  
  
[Both:]  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love that won't say never?  
When you don't know what you can do  
If you don't live you just regret it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?

Two a.m. with the lost and the lonely  
Walkin' past the kids, comin' back from the party  
Smiles on their faces, you remember so well how it was  
Nights in the back of that Buick that you got runnin'  
Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what you're doin',  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many, believed too much,  
Workin' your life to the bone  
  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He wants your money, wants your soul  
A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He says he's playin' for keeps  
Breathin' down your neck, boy  
It's sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
They'll take it away, when you're not lookin'  
Look you in the eyes, tell you how good they're doin'  
Smiles on their faces, are lies to keep you from knowin'  
You're not guilty, you are the victim,  
But you still pay for the crime  
Don't look for trouble, it'll always find you in time  
  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what you're doin',  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many, relieved too much,  
Workin' your life to the bone  
  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He says he's playin' for keeps  
Breathin' down your neck, boy  
It's sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
It won't be broken, I'll fight 'til I drop,  
Blood burnin' hot in my veins  
  
But they won't be satisfied until they take everything  
  
[Chorus]

Boy: On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the
red roses?  
Girl: Will he offer me his mouth?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: Will he offer me his teeth?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: Will he offer me his jaws?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: Will he offer me his hunger?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: Again. Will he offer me his hunger?  
Boy: YES  
Girl: And will he starve without me?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: And does he love me?  
Boy: Yes  
Girl: Yes  
Boy: On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the
red roses?  
Girl: Yes  
Boy: I bet you say that to all the boys.  
  
It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning  
There was fog crawling over the sand  
Oh when i listen to your heart i hear the whole world turning  
I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands  
Oh you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining i was dying just to
ask for a taste  
oh we were lying together in a silver lining by the light of the moon you know
there's not another moment, not another moment, not another moment to waste  
Oh well you hold me so close that my knees grow weak  
and my soul is flying high above the ground  
I'm trying to speak but no matter what i do  
I just can't seem to make any sound  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and i swear it's true  
I was just about to say i love you  
  
Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water and i guess that I'm beginning
to grin  
oh we're finally alone and we can do what we wanna  
oh the night is young  
and no-one's gonna no where you  
no-one's gonna know where you  
No-one's gonna know where you've been  
  
Oh you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining i was dying just to
ask for a taste  
oh we were lying together in a silver lining by the light of the moon you know
there's not another moment to waste  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and i swear it's true  
I was just about to say i love you  

On a hot summer night  
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?  
Will he offer me his mouth?  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his teeth?  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his jaws?  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his hunger?  
  
Yes  
  
Again, will he offer me his hunger?  
  
Yes!  
  
And will he starve without me?  
  
Yes!  
  
And does he love me?  
  
Yes  
  
Yes  
  
On a hot summer night  
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?  
  
Yes  
  
I bet you to say that to all the boys.  
  
It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning  
There was fog crawling over the sand  
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning  
I see the shooting stars, falling through your trembling hands  
  
While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining  
And I was dying just to ask for a taste  
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining  
By the light of the moon you know there's not another moment  
Not another moment  
Not another moment to waste  
  
Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak.  
But my soul is flying high above the ground.  
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do  
I just can't seem to make any sound.  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.

You took the words right out of my mouth.  
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.  
  
Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water  
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.  
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want  
Oh the night is young and ain't no-one gonna know where you  
No-one gonna know where you  
No-one's gonna know where you've been.  
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining.  
I was dying just to ask for a taste.  
We were lying together in a silver lining  
By the the light of the moon,  
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth oh  
(It must have been while you were kissing)  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
(It must have been while you were kissing)  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
(It must have been while you were kissing)  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
(It must have been while you were kissing)  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
(It must have been while you were kissing)  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Whoa it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

Should've listened when you said I'd miss you  
Should've listened but I could not hear  
You said I'd want you back  
I said not a chance  
Now I can see I was so blind  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, now I know  
You're right I was wrong  
  
Couldn't see it when I had you with me  
Couldn't see that I had everything  
And now I see it clear  
And you're not here  
You said someday I'd change my mind  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, now I know  
You're right I was wrong  
  
If I could have one more chance to hold you  
I would keep you here in my arms  
And never let you go  
Because now I know  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, baby now I know  
You're right I was wrong
