She's a little girl  
In a rich man's world  
Everything she'll do  
She'll do for you  
  
He's a monster mash  
Living on fame and cash  
Badly spoiled  
A loving dad  
  
Some might say just give it up  
There's no more hope, no fair  
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Some might say just give it up  
There's no more hope, no fair ?  
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Girl, can't you see?  
Come on now, set him free  
Try open up his eyes  
And make him realize his misery  
  
He do not care  
Sittin' over there  
Get up, stand up now  
Wake up the animal inside of you  
  
I think it should be inside

Oh Anthonio,  
It's been nearly one year since  
Our Rio  
Nights of forever  
Pictures of you and me  
Dancing and memories  
  
Through the masquerade  
You led me by the hand  
Whispered the words  
"This Is Forever"  
Said from the silver tongue  
Thats where it started from  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?  
Did you even know my name?  
Did you ever really care?  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Do you ever wonder why,  
Or where I am now?  
Do you ever feel ashamed?  
Do you even feel a thing?  
  
Oh  
  
There I was under stars  
Hearts made in the sand  
Lying from the boy  
From Ipanema  
Tide comes rushing in  
Time and time again  
  
Now that summer has gone  
Where did you run?  
All my letters are  
Returned to sender  
For eternity  
You're a part of me  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?  
Did you even know my name?  
Did you ever really care?  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
Do you ever wonder why,  
Or where I am now?  
Do you ever feel ashamed?  
Do you even feel a thing?  
  
Oh  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
You got everything you ever wanted from me,  
I was just another girl  
It was just another night  
  
Oh Anthonio,  
My Anthonio,  
There is only one thing,  
That I'm trying to say  
It may come as a suprise  
My baby has your eyes.

(verse)  
Look into yourself and see  
Do you know who you are? (who you are)  
When you're feeling sad and blue  
You should know that you are  
The sun and the moon to me  
I care for you can't you see  
You don't need to go so far  
And you know who you are (who you are)  
Hey people don't look so down  
Let me play in your game (in your game)  
If you wanna scream and shout  
You should not be ashamed  
Do what you want to do  
Don't let the world get on you  
Listen what I have to say  
Then you will be okay  
Come together!  
Now!  
Come together...  
(verse)  
Never too late to try  
Don't give up on yourself  
What you are searching for  
Will be find, you will see  
Just take it easily  
Let yourself be free  
Listen what I have to say  
Then you will be okay  
(chorus)  
Come together!  
Everyone are feeling fine  
People smiling  
Sun is shining on you  
Feel the light  
Come together!  
Feel the rhythm, dance with me  
Take my hand, integrity  
After rain comes the sun  
(break)  
(verse)  
Ah, it's such a lovely day  
So glad we're all here today  
Every single one of us  
Will be fine, you will see  
(chorus)  
(breakdown)  
If we...  
If we...  
If we...  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna be much better  
If we all come together  
This is gonna last forever  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna be much better  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna last forever

Rooster:  
I remember the way  
Our sainted mother  
Would sit and croon us  
Her lullaby  
  
Miss Hannigan:  
She'd say, kids, there's a place  
That's like no other  
You got to get there before you die  
  
Rooster:  
You don't get there  
By playing from the rule book  
  
Hannigan:  
You stack the aces  
  
Rooster:  
You load the dice  
  
Hannigan and Rooster:  
Mother dear  
Oh, we know you're down there listening,  
How can we follow  
Your sweet Advice to...  
  
Rooster:  
Easy street  
Easy street  
Where you sleep till noon  
  
Hannigan:

Rooster and Hannigan:

Easy street

Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:  
Easy street  
Easy street  
Where the rich folks play  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

For three of four bucks  
While she gets Warbucks  
  
Hannigan:  
The little brat!  
It ain't fair this here life  
Is drivin' me nuts!  
While we get peanuts  
She's livin' fat!  
  
Rooster:  
Maybe she holds the key  
That little lady  
  
Hannigan:  
To gettin' more bucks  
  
Rooster:  
Instead of less  
Maybe we fix the game  
With something shady  
  
Lily:  
Where does that put us?  
  
Hannigan:  
Oh, tell her.  
  
Rooster:  
I'll give you one gues  
  
Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:

Yes sirree  
Yes sirree  
Yes sirree  
  
Easy street  
Easy street  
That's where we're gonna... Be!

Without you, yeah  
Come on  
  
It took a long time  
But I'm back again for good  
It really hurt me  
But now I finally understood  
The day I left you  
Must be the greatest in my life  
I hear without you  
There's only peace around, no fight  
I tried so hard to  
Oh doing everything I could  
Manipulated  
Made to think I was no good  
In your possession  
Every day was a bad dream  
So naive then  
Well I was young and sixteen  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without you honey  
  
Funny how things change, yeah?  
Yesterday would all be a lie  
I told you  
Now it's all good  
  
I'm feeling down  
It took a time  
It took a time for me to heal for what  
I thought was love  
But I was wrong  
Blinded by your flashy love  
When I was weak  
And you were there  
Well it was obvious you did not care  
About the one  
No you don't bother  
Well I'm happy without you, honey  
  
Oh yeah they told me  
You should be careful what you do  
They only use you  
For his pleasures and absurd  
The love I gave you  
It was the last that you deserved  
Call us a nice time  
To own somebody, that's absurd  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey (Happy without you honey)  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without you honey (Oh oh oh, Happy without you)  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey  
  
Happy without you  
I'm happy without you  
I'm happy without you, boy

(verse)  
I saw you  
It was a rainy day in May or June  
I couldn't help it  
God, you looked so fine  
I just had to make you mine, all mine  
Well I'm a helpless fool for love  
Instantly  
I cannot eat nor sleep, no  
Hard to breathe  
You read my love so easy  
A, be, see  
Twist my mind around and 1, 2, 3  
Then I'm a helpless fool for...  
(chorus 1)  
Ah...  
When he walks (?)  
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes my day  
I'm the helpless one  
Ah...  
Not unkind  
I don't mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
I'm a fool for love  
(verse)  
All shook up  
I know it's stupid to precipitate  
Without getting all humiliate  
Didn't know what I should say or do  
Everything I'll give to you and me (when I'm here without you)  
We're gonna have a riot  
Trust in me (I can't live without you)  
I'm gonna make you happy  
What you need (helpless fool without you)  
I'll give you everything  
I'll try to be (you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)  
Still your helpless fool for...  
(chorus 2)  
Ah...  
When he walks  
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes me feel  
I'm a fool for love  
Ah...  
What a joy, you're my boy  
And it seems like a dream  
Now I'm all shook up  
Ah...  
Need you, Doctor Love  
Are you there?  
Every day I'm the helpless one  
Ah...  
Not unkind  
I don't mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
I'm a fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
(chorus 2)  
I am a helpless fool for love  
  
  

Warbucks and annie  
  
Together at last!  
Together for ever!  
We're tying a knot,  
They never can sever!  
  
Warbucks  
  
I don't need sunshine now,  
To turn my skies at blue --  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
I don't need anything but you!  
  
Warbucks  
  
You've wrapped me around  
That cute little finger.  
You've made life a song.....  
You've made me the singer!  
  
Annie  
  
And what's the bathtub tune  
You always "Bu-Bu-Boo?"  
  
Warbucks  
  
Bu-Bu-Bu  
Anything but you  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
You can say that again  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
But that's  
  
Annie  
  
Not now  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
That's then  
  
Annie  
  
I'm poor as a mouse,  
  
Warbucks  
  
I'm richer than Midas.  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
But nothing on earth  
Could ever divide us!  
And if tomorrow, I  
'm an apple seller, too--  
I don't need anything but you!  
  
Servants  
  
All  
  
Annie Annie  
You filled our life with a song  
  
They're two of a kind  
The happiest pair now  
Like Fred and Adelle, they're floating  
On air now  
And what's the title of the dream that just came true  
  
Warbucks  
  
I don't need anything  
  
Annie  
  
Anything  
  
All  
  
Anything  
I don't need anything  
But you

I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
I don't mind  
If it's the cold and sadistic you like  
But now I'm thinking  
Who's wearing your trousers now  
She's no good  
Oh stop pretending she's misunderstood  
I heard her saying it's either me or her  
Smell the coffee, boy, and open your eyes  
Life's too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
Oh, poor you  
With all your lockets that have broken in two  
Does she get a little excited, don't hide it  
I heard her screaming in the dead of the night  
Life's too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding-a ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Girlfriend wants to see who's calling  
Freaking out, your phone keeps going  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Life's too long  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)

Welcome

The night is long until the dawn  
Dodge your number, I speak to the tune  
Stay on hold till lips turn cold  
Will you call me later?  
Will I catch you later?  
I was looking for you, but you're never home  
Hours and hours, stay by day  
You never sided, you never told  
What I feel, what I know, what I hear is over!  
  
Chorus:  
Your love's so cold  
You raised me up and let me fall  
You seek the truth,  
For some become invisible.  
  
Girl you know me, I know you  
I make mistakes, that it's true  
If you can't forgive me, let me go  
I'm the devil in the dark  
I do what I'm told, talk to talk  
Hope the demons walk the walk  
My hands are dirtier, hell not!  
What I feel, what I know, what I hear  
It's over!  
  
Chorus:  
Your love's so cold  
You raised me up and let me fall  
You seek the truth,  
For some become invisible.  
With all this loss  
You took my heart to'  
But that's your heart  
And that becomes invisible  
  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
  
When life goes on, I'm without you  
You move to town and that's a rule  
Winter's cold and so are you!  
Close the door, say no more  
I was shocked, feel no loss  
Take it or leave it'  
Feel the rush now without you  
I was what we know is always over!

This we guarantee!  
Welcome to the movies  
Wait and see.  
  
Female chorus: Let's go to the movies (see the movies)  
Let's go see the stars.

That's our recipe  
So, welcome  
To the movies  
Wait...  
And...  
See!

Miss Hannigan  
  
Little girls  
Little girls  
  
Everywhere I turn I can see them  
Little girls  
Little girls  
Night and day  
I eat, sleep and breathe them  
  
I'm an ordinary woman  
With feelings  
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear  
But I'll admit  
No man has bit  
So how come I'm the mother of the year?  
  
Little cheeks  
Little teeth  
Everything around me is little  
If I wring  
Little necks  
Surely I will get an acquittal  
  
Some women are dripping with diamonds  
Some women are dripping with pearls  
Lucky me! Lucky me!  
Look at what I'm dripping with  
Little girls  
  
How I hate  
Little shoes  
Little socks  
And each little bloomer  
I'd have cracked  
Years ago  
If it weren't for my  
Sense of humor  
  
Some day  
I'll step on their freckles  
Some night  
I'll straighten their curls  
Send a flood  
Send the flu  
Anything that You can do  
To little girls  
  
(reprise)  
Some day I'll land in the nut house  
With all the nuts and the squirrels  
There I'll stay  
Tucked away  
Until the prohibition of  
Little, little, little.  
Little, little, little.

It's time to tell my story  
of a girl I used to know  
Always cried into her pillow  
under pinups on the wall  
She didn't make Italia Conte  
didn't get that TV show  
Then a nice man said he'd help her  
with a new portfolio  
  
Missus be Missus E Missus A-you-T  
Missus I Missus F-you-L  
I'm gonna reach the top  
I ain't ever gonna stop  
and I'm sure gonna ring your bell  
Missus D Missus I Missus F-F-I  
Missus see Missus you-L-T  
If ever there's a girl  
that could rock your world  
Then that girl sure is me  
(right!)  
  
(Chorus)  
So the fun won't start til she's living it up  
feeling good on top of the pops  
Can you make it me plus one?  
Dress falls down at the aftershow  
She breaks down in the video  
Think you'll find it's me plus one  
  
Now this wannabe seniorita  
met a group of likely girls  
Traded posters and the voxpops  
for jetting round the world  
But it didn't make her happy  
and now she flies alone  
The wrong pictures in the paper  
and no one back at home  
  
The people around you  
won't tell you how it is  
Don't you think it's gone on long enough?  
Take a look at yourself  
Get out of the car  
You know it's time  
you've got to let it go

I'll be on the next train.  
See you at dawn.  
A picture of us in the rain  
Look and it's gone  
  
Do you want my love or do want something I can't give you?  
How can I be sure that what you said before had been true?  
  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever. Be the same?  
Auh hah hah Will we ever?  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
  
Looking at the red, red sky thinking it through  
Twenty-Seven days and nights since I saw you  
Am I just a fool for wanting all of your attention?  
So tell me if I'm right or heading in the wrong direction?  
  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever. Be the same?  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever?  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Hope you are out there somewhere  
  
Is our love, Is our love an illusion. Will it fly away?  
Is our love, Is our love an illusion. Watch it fly away  
It's all of, it's all of an illusion. (4x)  
  
Auh hah hah. (2x)  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Auh hah hah

My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Thought I saw you last night smiling at me  
Thought I heard your voice calling for me  
Did I imagine it, was it a dream?  
What do you look like, are you just like me?  
  
My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Thought I saw you last night smiling at me  
Thought I heard your voice calling for me  
Day after day looking for something new  
Closer and closer the months between you  
  
My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Oh where ever will I meet you now?  
You didn't know  
You've been alone  
You've been away  
  
There's always something out there

Warbucks  
  
I know the Depression's depressing  
  
Grace  
  
The carols are stilled  
The stored aren't filled  
  
Warbucks  
  
And the windows are minus the dressing  
  
Grace  
  
The children don't grin  
The Santa's are thin  
  
Grace and warbucks  
  
And I've heard a terrible rumour  
No goodwill no cheer  
  
Warbucks  
  
But we'll get a new deal for Christmas  
This year  
  
Annie and orphans  
  
The snowflakes are frighting of falling  
  
Molly  
  
And oh, what a fix  
No peppermint sticks!  
  
Warbucks  
  
And all through the land folks are bawling  
  
Grace  
  
And filled with despair  
'Cause cupboards are bare  
  
Warbucks  
  
But Santa's got brand new assistants  
There's nothing to fear  
They're bringing a new deal deal for Christmas  
This year.

There is no easy love  
The one I'm thinking of  
I miss you every day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat, my sound  
My light, my destiny  
  
You rang the door one of a Sunday morning  
Said that I was always on your mind  
Smiled and said it's meaningless without me  
Girl, you're really one of a kind  
  
There was never anyone  
Until you just came around  
So afraid to be abandoned  
Can't afford to lose again  
  
There is no easy love  
The one I'm thinking of  
I miss you night and day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat, my sound  
My light, my destiny  
  
All I want to do  
Is to be with you  
Have some fun with you, yeah  
  
Tired of the past  
It was not a blast  
I don't want to do the same mistake again  
  
I called you up to say that I am sorry  
For all the things I said and I had done  
You told me to relax and not to worry  
You said to me that I was the one  
  
I had been working day and night  
Try to forget your smile so bright  
Didn't know what I should do  
So afraid to choose again  
  
The foolish things we do  
We wish for something new  
Like me when I had you  
  
It doesn't matter to me  
Whatever you choose to be  
My great velocity  
  
Would you talk to me?  
Come along with me  
Curiosity, yeah  
  
Would you talk to me?  
Come along with me  
Leave the past and now this time you'll see (won't you see?)  
  
There is no easy love (easy love)  
The one I'm thinking of (thinking of)  
I miss you everyday (everyday)  
(no no easy love)  
  
If you call this romance (this romance)  
I haven't got a chance (ain't got a chance)  
You're my destiny (destiny)  
(My great velocity)

Warbucks  
  
What is it about you  
You're big  
You're loud  
You're tough nyc  
I go years without you  
Then I  
Can't get  
Enough  
Enough of the cab drivers answering back  
In the language far from pure  
Enough of frankfurters answering back  
Brother, you know you're in nyc  
Too busy  
Too crazy  
Too hot  
Too cold  
Too late  
I'm sold

No other town in

The drive! (Nyc)  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
The city's bright  
As a penny arcade  
It blinks, it tilts, it rings  
  
Annie  
  
To think that I've lived here all of my life  
And never seen these things  
  
All  
  
Oh, nyc  
The whole world keeps coming  
  
Warbucks  
  
By bus

Just got here this morning  
Three bucks  
Two bags

Nyc  
  
I give you fair warning  
Up there  
In lights  
I'll be  
Go ask the Gershwins or Kaufman and Hart  
The place they love the best  
Though California pays big for their art  
Their fan mail comes addressed to nyc  
Tomorrow a penthouse  
That's way up high  
Tonight

Fifi, That ain't a name for this mutt.  
So how about Champion?  
Champion you're anything but.  
  
We could call him Tiger, But there's no bite in him,  
Tiger! Tppth, Kittens would frighten him.  
Rover! Why not think it over?  
Rover is the perfect name for this dumb look-in' dog.  
  
Sandy, Sandy's his name if you please.  
If you don't believe me ask anyone of the fleas  
Residing on Sandy,  
  
True he ain't pedigreed, Sandy, there ain't no better breed.  
And he really comes in handy,  
'Specially when you're all alone in the night  
And you're small and terribly frightened it's  
Sandy, Sandy who'll always be there!

WARBUCKS  
  
I've made me a fortune  
(That fortune made ten)  
Been headlined  
And profiled  
Again and again  
But something was missing  
(I never quite knew)  
That something was someone  
But who?  
  
My speeches are greeted  
With thunderous acclaim  
At two universities  
Bearing my name  
Yes, something was missing  
Each timeI got through  
That something was someone  
But who?  
  
Who could that someone be?  
How could she make it known?  
Who would need me for me?  
Need me for me alone?  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl?  
Who dreamed I could find it  
Yes something was missing  
But dreams can come true  
That something  
Is no one  
But you  
  
Who would need me for me?  
Need me for me alone  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl?  
Who'd dream I would find it  
In one little girl?  
Yes, something was missing  
But dreams do come true  
That something is no one... but you.

The sun will come out  
Tomorrow  
Bet your bottom dollar  
That tomorrow  
There'll be sun!  
  
Just thinkin' about  
Tomorrow  
Clears away the cobwebs,  
And the sorrow  
'Til there's none!  
  
When I'm stuck with a day  
That's grey,  
And lonely,  
I just stick out my chin  
And Grin,  
And Say,  
Oh  
  
The sun come out  
Tomorrow  
So ya gotta hang on  
'Til tomorrow  
Come what may  
  
Tomorrow!  
Tomorrow!  
I love ya  
Tomorrow!  
  
You're always  
A day  
Away!  
  
Tomorrow!  
Tomorrow!  
I love ya  
Tomorrow!  
  
You're always  
A day  
Away!

If he should need the F. B. I.  
Then he will have the F. B. I.

With all the favors that he's done  
J. Edger Hoover owes him one.

And he'll find them, I swear.  
  
Grace  
  
Oh, you won't be an orphan for long!  
  
All  
  
Where other men would call it quits  
And disappear  
He'll use his fortune and his wits.  
So never fear  
Cross the street  
Or cross the sea  
Annie, sweet  
We guarantee  
That you won't be an orphan...

You're with a man who always wins  
Trust him and he'll prove  
Mountains easily move  
Oh, you won't be an orphan --  
No, you won't be an orphan for long!

Hey, Dapper Dan  
You've both got your style  
But Brother,  
You're never fully dressed  
Without a smile!  
  
Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly  
They stand out a mile --  
But Brother,  
You're never fully dressed  
Without a smile!  
  
Who cares what they're wearing  
On Main Street,  
Or Saville Row,  
It's what you wear from ear to ear  
And not from head to toe

So, Senator,
