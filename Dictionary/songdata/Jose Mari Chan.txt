My idea of a perfect Christmas  
Is to spend it with you  
In a party or dinner for two  
Anywhere would do  
Celebrating the yuletide season  
Always lights up our lives  
Simple pleasures are made special too  
When they're shared with you  
  
Looking through some old photographs  
Faces and friends we'll always remember  
Watching busy shoppers rushing about  
In the cool breeze of December  
Sparkling lights all over town  
Children's carols in the air  
By the Christmas tree  
A shower of stardust on your hair  
  
I can't think of a better Christmas  
Than my wish coming true  
And my wish is that you'd let me spend  
My whole life with you

My head's in a jam can't take you off my mind  
From the time we met I've been beset by thoughts of you  
And the more that I ignore this feeling  
The more I find my self believin'  
That I just have to see you again  
  
Refrain  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go but I know  
That I am much too shy to let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong  
Words and displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
  
Like a child again  
I'm out and lost for words  
How does one define a crush combined with longing  
Longing to posses you oh so dearly  
I'm obsessed by you completely  
I'll go mad if I can't have you  
  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go but I know  
That I am much too shy to let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong  
Words and displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go  
Let me say the things and say the words to let you know  
I would rather say the awkward words than lose you  
Or for love to fade  
Before it can come true

We're at the afterglow  
Of what we both do know  
Know as the spring of our youth.  
We've loved and shared the dawn  
And hoped that we'd go on  
'Cause even that dawn had to go.  
  
Love has to cry  
But need not die  
Heart has to sigh  
The test of time  
  
We go through days and through years  
Calloused by doubts, joys and fears,  
  
Love has to grow  
But need not go  
Heart has to know  
The test of time  
  
We're at the afterglow  
And though we both do know  
How far we are from the dawn  
That second golden dawn  
When love is true  
Still I'll wait  
I'll wait for second dawn and you  
  
Love's golden dawn and you.

Whenever I see girls and boys  
Selling lanterns on the streets,  
I remember the Child  
In the manger as He sleeps.  
  
Wherever there are people  
Giving gifts, exchanging cards,  
I believe that Christmas  
Is truly in their hearts.  
  
Let's light our Christmas trees  
For a bright tomorrow  
Where nations are at peace  
And all are one in God  
  
Let's sing Merry Christmas  
And a happy holiday,  
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus  
Let Him be the One to guide us  
As another new year starts  
And may the spirit of Christmas  
Be always in our hearts.  
  
In every prayer and every song  
The community unites,  
Celebrating the birth  
Of our Savior, Jesus Christ  
  
Let love, like that starlight  
On that first Christmas morn,  
Lead us back to the manger  
Where Christ the Child was born  
  
So, come let us rejoice  
Come and sing a Christmas carol  
With one big joyful voice  
Proclaim the name of the Lord!

Deep in my Heart I love you  
Deep in my heart I care  
You are my life  
My everything, my dream, my every prayer  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
And we will love each other forever  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
  
And deep within my heart  
And deep in your heart  
Yes we will love each other forever  
Deep in my heart forever

Jose Mari Chan:  
When my work is through at the end of the day  
There's nothing else that I'd rather do  
Than to be with you at the end of the day  
To be right by your side makes me feel brand new  
'Cause you're my girl, my woman, my friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
You're my woman, my girl, and my friend  
Rolled into one.  
  
Janet Basco:  
You're my man and I'm at the prime of my life  
To you I give myself, all my heart  
All of what I am at the prime of my life  
I'll never let a thing come to break us apart  
'Cause I'm your girl, your woman, your friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
Than to be your woman, your girl, and your friend.  
  
Jose Mari Chan:  
Being with you, my love, just makes my day complete  
  
Janet Basco:  
Holding you close my love, creates a wondrous treat.  
  
Jose Mari Chan:  
No need to say the words  
No fancy places for me.  
  
Janet Basco:  
Love is anywhere  
As long as you are there with me.  
  
Both:  
We'll be free  
Our love will make us free to be you and me.  
  
Janet Basco:  
('Cause) I'm your girl, your woman, your friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
Than to be your woman, your girl, and your friend  
(Both) Rolled into one

It's 2am we're lying in bed  
Stillness all around there's not a sound except in my  
Head  
Of happy songs children laughing  
Kids celebrating youth like it never would end  
  
Not long ago they sat on our knees  
We drew cartoons, flew to the moon, trimmed Christmas  
Trees  
But time has flown look how they've grown  
Soon she'll be you, and soon he'll be... like me...  
  
There's no rewinding no replay  
The chance you lose today will be gone when it's gone  
We'll never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last, make these moments last... right now.  
  
But time has flown look how they've grown  
We'll never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last, make these moments last... right now.

Bakit sa tuwing Pasko lamang  
Mayroong saya  
Sa tuwing Pasko lamang  
Nagkakasama  
  
Pagkatapos ng Pasko ay limot na  
Ang pag-ibig na inalay sa isa't isa  
Sana't kahit hindi pasko  
Himig natin na inawit ay iisa  
Mahirap man o mayaman ka  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sana, araw-araw ay pasko  
Araw-araw ay mayroong pag-ibig sa bawat puso  
Sana ay araw-araw ay pasko  
Ng maglaho ang gulo  
At maghari ay katahimikan sa atin mundo  
Oh... Ohhhh...  
  
Bakit sa tuwing pasko lamang  
Nagbibigayan Mmmmmmm...  
Damdamin ay dapat na laging buksan  
Di naman maghirap ang magmahal  
Pagpalain ka pa nga ng Maykapal  
Sana kahit hindi Pasko  
Ang pintig sa puso'y di magbabago  
Ang mahalaga'y pagmamahal mo  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sana, araw-araw ay pasko  
Araw-araw ay mayroong pag-ibig sa bawat puso  
Sana ay araw-araw ay pasko  
Na maglaho ang gulo  
At maghari ay katahimikan sa atin mundo  
Oh... Ohhhh.....  
  
[Coda:]  
Sana araw-araw ay pasko  
Araw-araw ay mayroong pag-ibig sa bawat puso  
Sana araw-araw ay pasko  
Sana araw-araw ang pasko

If you love me, like you tell me  
Please be careful with my heart  
You can take it, just don't break it  
Or my world will fall apart  
You are my first romance, and I'm willing to take a chance  
That til life is through, I'll still be loving you  
I will be true to you, just a promise from you will do  
From the very start, please be careful with my heart  
  
I love you and you know I do  
There'll be no one else for me  
Promise I'll be always true, for the world and all to see  
Love has heard some lies softly spoken  
And I have had my heart badly broken  
I've been burned and I've been hurt before  
So I know just how you feel, trust my love is real for you  
I'll be gentle with your heart, I'll caress it like the morning dew  
I'll be right beside you forever  
I won't let our world fall apart  
From the very start, I'll be careful with your heart  
  
You are my first (and you are my last) romance  
And I'm willing to take a chance (I've learned from the past)  
That til life is through, I'll still be loving you  
I will be true to you (only to you)  
Just a promise from you will do  
From the very start (from the very start)  
From the very start (from the very start)  
Please be careful with (I'll be careful with)  
(Your) (my) heart

Tell me your name you're lovely  
Please tell me your name  
Just when I thought  
This would be one of those boring games  
You walked into these feelings  
You looked at me and smiled  
My heart unfroze and started going wild  
  
Can you imagine this  
The confusion of  
First love's kiss  
A return to wondering  
If the magic of love was this  
You merely said hello  
And my mind did a stop and go  
Can it possibly be  
The future for me is you  
  
Tell me your name  
I must know  
Won't you tell me your name  
I'm not insane  
Just frightened that you might go  
Don't go please stay beside me  
Wait until I can tell you all my schemes  
Chasing rainbows spinning dreams  
Finding someone to love like you  
  
I'm not insane  
Just frightened that you might go  
Don't go please stay beside me  
Just wait until I can tell you all my schemes  
Chasing rainbows spinning dreams  
Tell me please your name  
Tell me
