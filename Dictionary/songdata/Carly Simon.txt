Alone together, beyond the crowd  
Above the world, we're not too proud  
To cling together, we're strong  
As long as we're together  
  
Alone together, the blinding rain  
The starless night, were not in vain  
For we're together and what is there  
To fear together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together, together  
  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
  
As long as your close to me  
(Alone together)  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
(Alone together)

I am an old woman  
Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child that's grown old  
If dreams were thunder  
And lightening was desire  
Then this old house  
Would have burnt down  
A long time ago  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl  
I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at  
Just a free rambling man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I try  
Well  
The years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear 'em there buzzing  
And I ain't done nothing  
Since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening  
And have nothing to say  
  
Make me an angel  
That flies  
From Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this living  
Is just a hard way to go

Straight from the hall of fame  
One of the worlds great lovers  
Darling you're not to blame  
I'm just sorry that you've been discovered  
When I look in you eyes  
I know hundreds of girls have been there  
I tried to be civilized  
And pretend I don't care  
  
Take me away, burn out the past  
And hold me  
To calm my jealousy  
Hold me  
Forget your history  
I need you to show me  
We'll be like Adam and Eve  
That you love me  
I wish you had never loved anyone but me  
  
Breathless and overcome  
Knowin' my desire is showing  
Passion can make you dumb  
But does so much to keep you going  
Turn off the songs of the past romance and  
  
Hold me  
To calm my jealousy  
Hold me  
Forget your history  
I need you to show me  
We'll be like Adam and Eve  
that you love me  
I wish you had never loved anyone but me  
  
With too many options  
You spin like a top  
you spin like a top - until you drop  
But now that you've dropped I'm gonna pick you up  
And love you until we just can't stop  
And love you until we just can't stop

There's a new kind of dancing  
That's going to be the rage  
You just leave yourself behind  
Like an actor on a stage  
Cop a different pose  
From the pose you're in  
Shine a different attitude  
From underneath your skin  
  
Attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Any attitude is the proper attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Don't be afraid to change your attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Free up your spirit with a new attitude  
  
It don't even matter  
If you stretch or shake  
And it don't really matter  
What moves your body makes  
  
And it don't really matter  
What steps you choose to do  
Only one thing matters:  
That's your attitude  
Your attitude, attitude dancing  
  
Attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Learn to move in another attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Find the groove in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Don't be afraid of a new attitude  
  
It don't really matter  
What steps you choose to do  
The only thing that matters  
Is your attitude  
  
Your attitude, attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Do the locomotion in a new attitude  
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude  
Do the hully gully in a new attitude  
  
Find a role you like  
Capture it and freeze  
Then turn it around  
A hundred and eighty degrees  
Or if you're at a loss  
Observe some natural dude  
And turn into a mirror of his attitude  
  
Attitude, attitude, attitude  
Dancing  
  
  

We jumped into a river on the moon  
But the water was too cold  
We tried to buy the morning star  
But it was already sold  
I wanted to make it big with you  
But my plans must have been to bold  
  
And it's back down to earth again  
Back in my car and gone  
Back on the road  
Back on the road alone  
  
You were my summer angel  
You're eyes how they shone  
Just last night we were talking about  
How much our love had grown  
I wanted to prove how good it could be  
But my plans will have to be postponed  
  
'Cause it's back down to earth again  
Back in my car and gone  
Back on the road  
Back on the road alone

Back the way it was before  
Before the door was opened  
Back the way it was before  
Before the ice was broken  
Back the way it used to be  
Everyone thought I was funny  
But nobody ever asked me  
If I wanted tiny little sandwiches  
Sent up to my room  
Back the way it was before  
I was always waiting  
Everyone thought I was okay  
But now I'm scintillating  
Back the way it used to be  
Some people thought I was pretty  
But not many passes were made at me  
Back the way it was before  
But now my prayers are answered  
And my star is on the rise  
Flashbulbs popping, traffic stopping  
Everyone's my best friend  
Back the way it used to be  
Money was always a tyrant  
I spent it all paying my rent  
Back the way it used to be  
But now my prayers are answered  
And my star is on the rise  
Flashbulbs popping, traffic stopping  
Everyone's my best friend  
Back the way it used to be  
Sing a song of long ago  
Back the way it used to be  

(Rodgershart)  
He's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have his charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
Love's the same old sad sensation  
Lately I've not slept a week  
Since this half pint imitation's  
Put me on the blink  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A simpering whimpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I  
I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep  
Until love came and told me I shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I  
Oh I lost my heart but what of it  
He is home I am free  
Oh but he can laugh and I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And worship the trousers that cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And long for the day I'll cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

So many tech-heads  
Recent invasion  
I stretch out my long legs  
And I kick away the mouse pad, baby  
  
Amazon, eBay, Oracle, he say  
He promise a freebee  
But he's such a pokey little guy  
Wait, I hear big footsteps  
  
Thud, thumping out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Cyberman lights up  
  
But mostly he floppy  
Computer man crashes  
He's so humpty dumpty, baby  
Now he tries this experiment  
  
Though he knows it's so low-tech  
He tries patting his forehead  
While he's rub, rub, rubbing my stomach, baby  
But he can't do it, can he?  
  
No, no he can't do that at all  
But wait, I hear big footsteps  
Thud, thumbing out of the past  
Sure enough, that big dumb guy  
  
Is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Big papa bear  
Maybe you can remember  
  
It wasn't that long ago  
When you dialed a number  
You got a living, breathing human being  
On the telephone  
  
Don't want nothing to do  
But just study the skin on your face  
I want to look up at the sky  
And watch the sunset  
  
With someone like you  
Wait, I hear big footsteps  
Thud, thumbing out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here, he's here  
In fact he's brought his  
Big raccoon coat with him  
  
And he doesn't even know it's  
Politically incorrect  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
I see him now walking torward me  
  
Let's get it on with your big bad self  
Get it on babe, Get it on babe  
Get it on babe, Get it on babe  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
  
Big, big, big, big, big  
Big dumb guy  
Oh, ha - smartest guy  
I ever knew yeah  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Kiss me, kiss me now  
If feels so good  
I don't want to have to go into those chat rooms anymore  
  
I don't want to see that pinwheel go round  
And around and around  
Every time I try to open any window  
Hold me, you big dumb guy  
You smart guy

You may think I'm dumb  
Or you may think you're sly  
But I know what you're cravin'  
I've been watchin' your eyes  
There's a girl 'cross the room  
She's been glancin' this way  
both of you wonderin'  
when you'll have your day  
  
Black honeymoon  
I'll be leavin' you soon  
Next time maybe I'll be the girl  
Across the room  
black honeymoon  
  
She's tossin' her hair  
She won't meet my stare  
I turn to accuse you  
You pretend she's not there  
The pains not so bad  
cause I've played through this game  
The players are different  
But the moves they're the same  
Now she's gone  
And you're smilin' back  
but my blood's turned to ice, ice, ice, ice  
Now I don't feel undone  
And I don't feel afraid  
there's nothing quite so cold  
As the heart you've betrayed

Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly, all your life  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see, all your life  
You were only waiting for this moment to be free  
  
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly  
Into the light of the dark black night  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly, all your life  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

My heart is sad and lonely  
I sigh for you  
For you dear only  
Why haven't you seen it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
I spend my days in longing  
And wonder why  
It's me you're wronging  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
I can't believe it  
It's hard to conceive it  
That you'd turn away romance  
Are you pretending  
It looks like the ending  
Unless you'd give me one more chance  
To prove dear  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours just for the taking  
I'd gladly surrender  
Myself to you - Body and Soul

I'm home again in my old narrow bed  
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end  
The low beam room with the window looking out  
On the soft summer garden  
Where the boys grew in the trees  
  
Here I grew guilty  
And no one was at fault  
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought  
And the silent understanding passing down  
From daughter to daughter  
Let the boys grow in the trees  
  
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you  
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude  
Deny yourself and hope someone will see  
And live like a flower  
While the boys grew in the trees  
  
Last night I slept in sheets the colour of fire  
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires  
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze  
And watch by the window  
Where the boys grew in the trees

There's a hand that's old and rough  
And it's holding on  
To one that's new and small  
Whose life has just begun  
Hand in hand  
Young and old  
Calm each others fears  
Christmas is almost here  
  
There's a rocky road ahead  
Two people walk alone  
Wondering in the fading light  
If they can find their home  
When hope is almost gone  
A distant light appears  
Christmas is almost here  
  
Almost here for those in doubt  
For those who must remain  
Left behind when love goes cold  
And shifting life makes change  
  
Almost here for dreamers  
Who think that there's a chance  
That they will find their music  
And a partner for the dance  
  
There's a dream that doesn't die  
Now we walk as one  
Justice has a gentle hand  
And love is like the sun  
  
The darkest night is past  
And by the stars we steer  
Christmas is almost here  
Christmas is almost here

Summer time, kids in the street  
We were up on the roof laughing at the heat  
That was the last I ever saw of you  
  
Now it's December, cold and dark  
No more rainbows over Central Park  
In this house no window has a view  
There's no love here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
When you gonna come back home  
When you gonna see it's been too long  
When you gonna come back home to me  
  
Standin' at the door and I turn the key  
I'm holding my breath half expecting to see  
You lyin' on the bed, smilin' up at me  
I'm goin' crazy 'cause I just don't know  
Which way your heart's gonna go  
I only pray it leads you back to me  
Darlin' let your heart  
Lead you back to me

Sitting in a car here  
After a party where we've seen  
Everyone we've known for years  
Well I've known you for years  
Oh but now it's all changed  
And all of my feelings  
Have been rearranged  
  
[Chorus]  
Come upstairs  
We'll be all alone  
Come upstairs  
No one will know  
Come upstairs  
We can take of the phone  
Come upstairs  
You can take of my clothes  
  
Say that it feels good  
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream  
You want to knock on some wood  
Well I'll give you some wood  
And I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
Come upstairs  
We'll have a few laughs  
Come upstairs  
We'll take a bath  
Come upstairs  
It's only one flight  
Come upstairs  
You can stay overnight  
  
I'll give you some wood  
Yeah, I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
[Chorus]

When the heart of the hundred acre wood is beating  
And time is passing through  
There's a shadow looking like a rainbows halo  
And there I'm resembling you  
  
More than fame  
A name on a tree  
More than power or might  
Sweeter than the treats of a honey bee  
I'll be here through the night  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
Silent as the moon at dawn  
Soothing as a bed filled with hay  
Strong as a hero in the land of old  
I'll be here through the day  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
Greyer than gloom on a rainy afternoon  
Sadder than being sorry for me  
Finer than finding my tail again  
I'll be here for all of thee  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
You only get a few good friends in this life  
Who are devoted and true  
And right here in this now and near  
It's clear that it's all of you  
  
I'll find you when you're hard to see  
I'll look for you everywhere  
You'll know just how I'm feeling when  
I show you that I care  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's so comforting to know

Chain smoking cigarettes  
Enemies across the table  
Wonderin' if I can ever trust anyone again  
We argue through the night  
the restaurant shuts, you catch your flight  
I hail a cab with no idea where home might be  
  
We both believed my chance was gone  
But ain't it strange how life goes on  
A storm can never rage forever  
And darkness only lasts 'til dawn  
  
Hotel blinds stay down  
Nothing seems to make me care  
I can't find a reason to comb my hair  
Folks walkin' in the street  
Everyone has something to do  
My brain won't stop showin' those old movies of you  
  
Weeks pass,  
And your voice sounds strange on the telephone  
Strange how smooth and casual my own voice sounds  
I find that I'm listening to  
A tune coming over my radio  
It makes me think of a guy I knew a while ago  
A while ago a while ago

Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat don't come out and fly in me face tonight  
  
Well i come home from a party  
And i'm feelin' a little spaced  
And i walk on in the kitchen and  
A bat fly in me face  
Well de bat come down the chimney  
You see he wait in the fireplace  
When he hear that i'm getting a little snack  
De bat fly in me face  
  
(chorus)  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat he don't come out  
And fly in me face tonight  
  
De bat he rat got wings  
All the children know that  
What i need to know from the lord  
Is how you get de wings on the cat  
They say a bat's got radar  
And he can fly through fan  
But what i am afraid of is  
That he got another plan  
To fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
  
(chorus)  
Well i hope de bat he don't come out  
And fly in me face tonight  
Fly in me face  
  
One thing i forgot to tell you about the human race  
Everybody get a little upset when a bat fly in they face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat he don't come out  
And fly in me face tonight

Darlin' you can count on me  
Till the sun dries up the sea  
Until then I'll always be devoted to you  
  
I'll be yours through endless time  
I'll adore your charms sublime  
Guess by now you know that I'm devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you

Didn't I give you midnight?  
Didn't I give you the month of June  
Didn't I make it alright  
When everything was ruined  
Didn't I say didn't I  
Didn't you say didn't I too  
Didn't we both say didn't I  
'Till didn't we say we're through  
Didn't I try, didn't I cry  
Didn't I?  
  
Sorry that your mother dropped you on your head  
Maybe her mother dropped her too  
In the end we all get dropped  
We all get black and blue  
  
But didn't I always love you long  
When time was short and the night was cold  
Didn't I admit that I was wrong  
When the anger was new but the fight was old  
Didn't I say didn't I  
'Till didn't we say we're through  
Didn't I try, didn't I cry  
Didn't I, didn't I,  
Didn't I do?

If I had wings  
Like Noah's dove  
I'd fly  
Across the water  
To that man I love  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
In the drizzling rain  
All around my heart  
Was an aching pain  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
If I had listened  
To what my mama said  
I'd of stayed at home  
In momma's bed  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
It won't be long  
You'll call my name  
And I'll be gone  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Fare you well

You come on strong telling everyone  
About your latest role  
How you saved the movie, stole the show  
Well everybody knows  
And if you have no time for all your offers  
You'll see that I get called  
And if you have no time for all your men  
You'll see that I get balled  
  
Well I don't expect humility  
But what about some good old fashioned dishonest modesty  
  
You say that you can understudy  
All the other parts  
You can write a song that will make us cry  
that touches all our hearts  
And you can House and Garden  
Vogue and Glamour, Mademoiselle  
But I know you can Bitch and Screw  
And Penthouse just as well  
  
I don't expect humility  
But what about some good old dishonest modesty  
  
You try to be unique  
But somehow something's wrong  
'Cause your flower childish vision of life  
Cannot last too long  
You're over thirty and underweight  
Though you call yourself petite  
And you hang around with all the clowns  
You think they're so elite  
  
Well I don't expect humility  
But what about some good old fashioned dishonest modesty

Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Nothing like a rainy night  
To set your heart remembering  
Nothing like a vivid dream  
To take you back again  
  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Something in my pocket  
That was written years ago  
In faded ink said "You are my fire"  
Do you think so  
  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Is it easier for you to say  
You never loved me anyway  
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk  
Like a stowaway  
  
Do you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
  
Oh, baby, do the walls come down  
Oh, baby, do the walls come down  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come down  
  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come down  
Do the walls come down  
  
When you think of me

I'll take some of this, I'll have some of that  
And several more of these  
Now that I see it, I know what I like  
So I'll like it if you please  
I ain't nobody's princess, stuck in Sunday School  
So I'll help myself to love  
And have the whole career  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here  
  
Just look at you now, the ultimate guy  
Class and wit and style  
Once I might have pretended, to be someone else  
Attracting you with guile  
But now I'm not about to dress up, in some other woman's shoes  
I've got nothing to lose  
So I'll help myself to love,  
Gather round and cheer  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here  
  
I've stood there patiently waiting in line  
A take-out man's an O.K. plan  
If you've got lots of time  
Especially if he's biodegradable  
  
I ain't nobody's princess  
I ain't nobody's fool  
So I'll help myself to love  
There's nothing more to fear  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here

At night I heard God whisper lullabies  
While Daddy next door whistled whisky tunes  
And sometimes when I wanted, they would harmonize  
There was nothing those two couldn't do  
  
Embrace me you child, you're a child of mine  
And I'm leaving everything I am to you  
Go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy  
And God sang, Pray the devil doesn't get to you  
  
I thought together they must sing the moon away  
I thought that they must know each other well  
For the magic that they made, when they played  
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell  
  
Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven  
And God came down to earth and slipped away  
I pretended not to notice I'd been abandoned  
But no-one sang the night into the day  
And later night time songs came back again  
But the singers don't compare with those I knew  
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went  
But there was nothing those two couldn't do

(Cole Porter)  
  
Everytime we say goodbye I die a little  
Everytime we say goodbye I wonder why a little  
Why the gods above me who must be in the know  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go  
  
When you're near there's such an air of Spring about it  
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it  
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to  
Minor  
Everytime we say goodbye  
  
Why the gods above me who must be in the know  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go  
And when you're near there's such an air of Spring about it  
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it  
  
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to  
Minor  
Everytime we say goodbye, everytime we say goodbye  
Everytime we say goodbye, everytime we say goodbye.....

First she sees her hypnotist  
When she rushes to her psychiatrist  
She sees her acupuncturist  
She's got to got to get fixed  
  
Then she sees her scientologist  
Gets fed by her nutritionist  
She can not seem to resist  
Seeking cosmic consciousness  
  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
She swears by Jack La Lanne  
then she throws the I Ching again  
She searches in the Himalayas  
For someone to ease the pain  
  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
She's looking for a cure  
She does not know exactly what for  
  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
She's into political activism  
Reading up on Tibetan Buddism  
Anna Freud's analysed her dreams  
And she's hoarse from primal screams  
  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like she's floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again

Let's make love for old times sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our hearts to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
Remember you as Mars  
And me as Venus  
Strange to see the grey in your hair  
And now feel a peace so deep between us  
And to realize that we still care  
  
Let's make love for old times sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our hearts to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
I used to think we would wind up together  
Our destinies always entwined  
Oh but your heart kept changing like the weather  
And you would up leaving me behind  
  
Let's make love for old time's sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our heart's to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake  
  
Let's make love for old time's sake  
Let's set right an old mistake  
Let's invite our heart's to break  
It's right tonight  
But just for old time's sake

Let me be before the world  
What I am when I'm alone  
And when my vision falls below  
Let there be forgiveness  
  
Let me answer when I'm called  
Let me know the voice is right  
And when it's deep inside my soul  
I'll know it by it's light  
  
And when it's deep inside my soul  
I'll know it by it's light  
Help me to make the loving choice  
  
Let me answer when I'm called  
By the mighty and the small  
In the service of my soul  
Let there always be forgiveness  
Forgive

One of us slipped last night  
And said "Darling"  
There in the middle of the night  
Between dream and sleep  
Did you say it or did I  
I don't know  
But it interrupted the war  
That's the way  
These cold wars are  
I love you we said  
Or one of us did  
And the other agreed  
From the heart  
  
One of us slipped last night  
And said "Sorry"  
There in the middle of the madness  
Between the dark and the light  
Who cares if all the doors had been closed  
And no love had entered for days  
Cold wars like these go up in a blaze  
I love you we said  
Or one of us did  
And the other agreed  
From the heart  
through the haze of the dream  
The truth could come through  
You can see that I'm still  
Open to you  
I love you  
I love you we said from the heart

Thank you for informing me  
That I've been banned from Canada  
It comes as no surprise to me  
Since last week it was Africa  
Since you've been ambassador  
There's trouble at the border  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
It's amusing still it makes me wince  
Your face is like a scimitar  
When accidentally eye to eye  
You shoot a look of vinegar  
What could I have done to you  
To make you act the way you do  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
For whatever reason  
You would keep me  
Halfway 'round the world  
I believe it's like some kind of compliment  
I must be quite a girl  
Quite a girl  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
Once upon a time you swore you'd love me  
'Til the end of the world  
Now, nowhere is far enough away for you  
I must be quite a girl  
Quite a girl  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world

It's all of our birthdays this summer  
One number older, another year younger  
I'll go to your party, you'll come to mine  
We've given up cigarettes, we've given up wine  
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts  
I don't try to seduce you, we don't even flirt  
We're too good to be happy, too straight to be sad  
So just blow out the candles, Happy Birthday  
  
Stay out of the ocean, stay out of the sun  
Stay in perfect shape and be number one  
We've got brilliant excuses for having no fun  
So blow out the candles, Happy Birthday  
  
Make love in the microwave  
Think of all the time you'll save  
And don't forget to make it look  
As though you're working very very hard  
  
But I'll be your lover if you will be mine  
We'll go back to the garden and have a good time  
And if I'm offered an apple, I'll politely decline  
And just blow out the candles  
Happy Birthday

So this is Christmas and what have you done,  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.  
  
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,  
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.  
  
And so happy Christmas for black and for white  
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
And so this is Christmas and what have we done  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
War is over if you want it, war is over now.

There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
Like an echo in the wind leaves, unreconciled -  
Waiting to be picked up and bounced down again on  
Listeners ears  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And you know who I am  
Though I never leave my name or number  
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And you know who I am  
Though I never leave my name or number  
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And I can't sleep easy  
'Cause I'm afraid of dreaming  
And then the memory of the dream  
There's always someone haunting someone  
Haunting someone  
Haunting someone

Have you seen me lately?  
What was it you saw  
Are you gonna catch me  
With my hand in the jar, naked singing in the choir?  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Did I look O.K.  
Are you gonna shame me and take my toys away?  
  
Don't wake me unless you love me  
It takes too long to fall back to sleep  
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine  
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Did I miss a beat  
Are you gonna make me get back on my feet?  
  
Don't wake me unless you love me  
It takes too long to fall back to sleep  
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine  
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Was I crazy?  
Don't wake me  
Don't wake me  
Don't wake me

Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry little Christmas now

Why do I try to win the love  
That I've already wooed and won  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause he likes to roll he likes to roll  
He likes to roll he likes to roll  
He takes the flower from his button hole  
When he likes to roll, he likes to roll  
I tend to lose my self control  
When he likes to roll, he likes to roll  
  
Here in this little sunny bay  
Once a day he comes and goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He likes to roll...  
  
The moon is down but the odds are high  
That seeming me, he won't pass me by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He likes to roll...

He started a company  
When he was a young man  
Handsome, and like a reed so tall  
With a face like an old photograph  
She would fall for him  
Fall for him  
She would fall  
  
She wore her mother's cocktail dress  
With saddle shoes  
She was pretty and she was small  
She worked the switchboard  
Down the hall from him  
Down the hall  
  
[Chorus]  
He said: "Hello little woman"  
She said: "Hello big man"  
And that was how the wooing  
And the winning began  
He said: "Hello little woman"  
She said: "Hello big man"  
  
Of course New York in those days  
Was carriage rides and matinees  
He took her to a ball  
At the Waldorf Astoria  
He would fall for her  
Fall for her, he would fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could hear them laugh  
As they danced in their room  
And the shadows on the avenue  
Rose into a jealous moon  
Which swung low in the dawn light  
To see what was going on with those two  
  
You keep on expecting  
Something to go wrong  
And nothing does  
They still live in the house  
Where we were born  
Pictures of us kids  
Hanging up all over the walls  
  
And some say he built his empire  
For wealth and fame  
But, if you ask him why  
He'll say he did it all for her  
All for her  
All for her  
  
[Chorus]

His friends are more than fond of Robin  
He doesn't need to compliment them  
And always as he leaves he leaves them  
Feeling proud just to know him  
  
When Robin goes on holiday  
There's no-one livin' in our lane  
Oh yes, folks still live in our lane  
But they're not like Robin  
  
Robin, I've never told you  
But I'll be yours until we're old  
Please learn to call me in your dreams  
The way I'm lookin' at you is just as it seems  
  
He's talked about before he gets there  
Though he can never understand it  
And I wouldn't like to be his alone  
But I'm shy and can't demand it  
  
But when Robin gives his love to others  
There's no-one living in my heart  
Oh yes, I keep others in my heart  
But they're not like Robin

Free my eyes  
Fill the skies  
We've been dancing in your absence  
  
[Chorus]  
Da da da...  
Morning, hola, soleil  
  
We've kept the darkness light  
Dancing for the sun  
To come back and rise up shining  
  
Welcome home  
Mother sun  
Children reaching up like flowers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We made it through the night  
Knowing you'd return  
To bless us with another morning  
  
Baking sand, shining sea  
Turning world  
Dissolving shadows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Behold the warmth of day  
Rising near the shore  
Hear the music start up playing

You say you're not worthy of me  
But how do you know when you can't see  
Your eyes where midnight catches fire  
I can't describe this dizzy desire  
  
Can you be so insecure  
That you don't know what this grin is for  
Do you think I always act this way  
Silly and silent, and eager to stay  
When you're holding me tonight  
Holding me tonight  
  
You think it's all a mistake  
That I'm lost in a dream from which I'll wake up  
There you'll be just another guy  
You could never be but I dare you to try  
When you're holding me  
Holding me tonight  
  
I walk into your room  
You blush when I see it in a mess  
So I undress and close my eyes  
A room with a view  
Is in the dark with you  
But that should come as no surprise  
  
It's not a matter of mind  
The choice of the heart is a different kind  
It's always been a mystery  
When you walk into the room It happens to me  
And when you're holding me  
Holding me tonight

Hurt to think that you lied to me  
Hurt way down deep inside of me  
You said your love was true and we'd never part  
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart  
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know  
Hurt because I still love you so  
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do  
I would never, never hurt you  
  
Hurt to think that you lied to me  
Hurt way down deep inside of me  
You said your love was true and we'd never part  
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart  
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know  
Hurt because I still love you so  
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do  
I would never, never hurt you

Hush, little baby, don't say a word.  
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird  
  
And if that mockingbird won't sing,  
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring  
  
And if that diamond ring turns brass,  
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat  
  
And if that billy goat won't pull,  
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull  
  
And if that cart and bull fall down,  
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town

I gave my love a cherry  
That had no stone  
I gave my love a chicken  
That had no bone  
I told my love a story  
That had no end  
I gave my love a baby  
With no crying.  
How can there be a cherry  
That has no stone?  
And how can there be a chicken  
That has no bone?  
And how can there be a story  
That has no end?  
And how can there be a baby  
With no crying?  
  
A cherry when it's blooming  
It has no stone  
A chicken when it's pippin'  
It has no bone  
The story that I love you  
It has no end  
A baby when it's sleeping  
It's no crying.

I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except when the soft rains fall  
And drip from the leaves, then I recall  
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course I do  
But I get along without you very well  
  
I've forgotten you just like I should  
Of course I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someone's laugh that is just the same  
But I've forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool I am  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
What's in store  
Should I phone once more  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except perhaps in Spring  
But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two

Though folks with good intentions  
Tell me to save my tears  
Well I'm so mad about him  
I can't live without him  
  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
Not made of wood  
I've got it so bad  
And that ain't good  
  
But when the fish are jumpin'  
And Friday rolls around  
My man an' I, we gin some  
We pray some, and sin some  
  
He don't love me like I love him  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
Yes I've got it bad  
And that ain't good

My love must be a kind of blind love  
I can't see anyone but you  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue, you are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
  
And I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue, you are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
  
And I only have eyes, yes I only have eyes  
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you  
Only have eyes for you, only for you

It's not as if I want to rule the world  
Or even the forest  
Or even one tree  
I suppose I could be happy  
If I could be helpful  
With just a little bit of noticing me  
  
If I wasn't so small  
I could be like Tigger  
Figure out ways to help  
Some of those in need  
Indeed I could volunteer  
As the friend that you would want right near  
More like Rabbit and Pooh and Eeyore  
  
I'd be useful and helpful  
The one you would call  
Can I walk around my shadow  
Once before it disappears into the sun  
Run circles around the bees  
Bring the heffalump to his knees  
Catch the pollen before the sneeze  
I'd be needed and useful  
More each passing day  
  
I may be small  
But in the biggest, helpfulest way

Funny sometimes how you think  
You found someone  
Out of all the others you recall  
He stays a little longer on your mind  
The only one  
When life becomes the hardest place to fall  
  
If it wasn't love at all  
Then what were all those feelings and why  
If it wasn't love at all  
Can't I just go on dreamin'  
  
Starting out at zero we built it up  
Built it up  
And made it more than  
Most will ever do  
Maybe it was just in times of need  
We stayed in touch  
But not enough to last one whole life through  
  
If it wasn't love at all  
Then what were all those feelings and why  
If it wasn't love at all  
Can't I just go on dreamin' tonight  
  
Living for you now is all I want  
Who but you could ever really change  
This changing of mine  
Loving you I thought  
That I had found the other side  
  
If it wasn't love at all  
What were all those feelings and why  
If it wasn't love at all  
Can't I just go on dreamin'  
Can't I just go on dreamin' tonight

I'll be around  
No matter how you treat me now  
I'll be around  
When she's gone  
Your latest love  
Will never last  
And when it's past  
I'll be around when she's gone  
  
Goodbye again  
And if you find a love like mine  
Just now and then  
Drop a line to say (that) you're feeling fine  
  
And when things go wrong  
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
And I'll be around when she's gone  
  
I'll be around  
When she's gone

I'm a fool to want you,  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true,  
A love that's there for others too  
I'm a fool to hold you,  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone,  
To share a kiss the devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
And then would come a time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
Take me back, I love you,  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong,  
It must be wrong  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along without you  
Hmmmm, I'm a fool to want you  
You hurt me time and time again  
But I still love you babe  
I'm a fool, I'm your fool

I would be much obliged  
To hear about  
Your lonesome childhood  
And the way  
You were done in  
By the folks back home  
But that's all over now  
You know  
The future looks good  
And I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
You know the reason  
That I know  
You just can't live  
Without me  
Is the way  
You fall apart  
When I'm not there  
Your hair gets snarled  
And you cannot tie  
Your shoes  
My pretty baby  
And I'm all it takes  
To make you happy  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
Just delight  
In what you do not know  
The rest is hazy  
And you know  
You're much too old  
To be free  
  
If you tried  
To look beyond the deal  
It would amaze me  
Cause I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy  
I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy

(feat. The Pointer Sisters)  
  
  
  
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen  
Tonight we'll put all other things aside  
Get in this time and show me some affection  
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night  
  
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you  
  
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow  
Sweet memories will last for long long time  
We'll have a good time, Baby, don't do worry  
And if we're still playin' around boy that's just fine  
  
Let's get excited, we just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you, I want you  
  
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
I'm so excited, I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you

In a small moment  
She accepted credit for something she did not do  
She said she'd done the water color in her bedroom  
But it was done by a friend from school  
Just a little lie  
No one would discover  
At least not very soon  
  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by  
  
In a small moment  
In a restaurant where she worked the late night shift  
She short changed a sailor and made five  
You could never really call it a theft  
Just a little lie  
Swept up in her apron and kept as a well deserved gift  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by  
  
In a small moment  
She cheated on her lover and placed it in the back of her mind  
As long as nobody knew the truth about her  
It could never really be unkind  
Just a little lie  
That slipped beside her as she tossed and turned in her alibis  
  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by  
Just a little lie  
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by  
Slipped on by

How can I go on when every thought hurts  
I flirt with the notion of no more songs  
My old familiar foe, self pity, haunts me  
I'm stuck in some over-the-mountain town  
In a meaningless bar where fat hands  
Round the steiners  
And no one cares if it suns or pours  
In an hour between trains  
Barney puts the record on  
And the aimless rise to dance  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
I see you, George, in your  
Apartment on Riverside Drive  
Some fifty years ago  
Your fingers on the keys  
Looking for the song  
Looking for that hook  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
Who were you then?  
Did you have a woman?  
Were you hard up for cash?  
Did you ever know you'd be heard in  
The middle distance  
In some over-the-mountain town?  
Connecting to the muscles of the dancers  
In this close and smoky room  
  
Who were you then?  
Were you sure of your tune?  
Or were your dreams and your courage all broken down like mine?  
Now there's something that clutches the heart  
A melody that stays  
  
Year after year  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all I want my arms around you  
I'm already late for my train  
But I don't think about that  
I think of you, George  
At your piano, sweating in the summer heat  
  
By the way, did you get your girl,  
Did you by your house in the country?  
Did you wait for something that never came?  
Did you die still waiting for your train?  
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama  
Come to mama do  
  
Some part of your heart twists and turns in mine  
Your soul rises  
There's an angel in charge  
There's one note that weeps the truth  
And makes my life mean something  
Just for the length of  
  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama,  
Come to mama do  
  
I will go home, I will try again  
I will catch the train  
Catch another breath  
Move back to the piano and  
Let the notes do what they'll do  
In honor of you, George  
In honor of you

The only place I hang my hat is in my dreams  
The only time I feel at home is in my dreams  
The only place I'm not alone is in my dreams  
The only place I recognize is in my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
That's the only place I know  
To wander to and fro  
I move about and go  
As slow as time will let me go  
  
Sometime I'll only dream and I'm not scared of that  
I'll move through farther galaxies, wear other hats  
  
Trip on a wink, an inkling of a shadow fill  
An eclipse in less than half a blink  
Where you love me still  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
As slow as time will let me go  
Let me go, let me go

This gray sky  
Is good for cryin'  
These November gray woods  
Open to the fields  
I came out here  
In the cold  
For my poor heart  
Has turned to frost  
  
I don't understand  
What you just told me  
What is all this about  
About just being friends  
It's a lousy lie  
And a far cry  
From what goes on  
Between you and me  
  
Pain, in pain  
I'm in pain  
  
You held me close to you  
I didn't tell you what to do  
We were burnin', burnin'  
Burnin', burnin'  
You made love to me  
We were cryin', we were flyin'  
We were dyin' in these fields  
We'd come out here in the soft nights  
I was sunburned under you  
  
Pain, in pain  
I'm in pain  
  
So you want me to say  
Do you want me to say, you want me to say  
Say that I don't love you  
Do you want me to smile, try, lie  
And look away  
How far away all the stars seem  
And that gypsy moon  
Cries, "You're a fool"

In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
What'll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
What'll ya do  
What do you do?  
  
I think once upon a time  
Heffalump's ruled the forest  
They rocked and stomped and blew their horns  
To their new and dearest  
They scared all the rest of us  
The Heffalump is as a Heffalump does  
As a heffalump now is a heffalump was  
  
What'll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
What'll do, what'll do, what'll do?  
What do you do?  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
What'll do, what'll do, what'll do

In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
At the moon in the sky  
My thoughts fly straight to you  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh, the times without number  
Darling, when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dream come true?  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night?  
  
In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh, the times without number  
Darling, when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dream come true?  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night?  
  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night

When the sun is high in the afternoon sky  
You can always find something to do  
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on  
Something happens to you  
  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
While the whole wide world is fast asleep  
You lie awake and think about the boy  
And never ever think of counting sheep  
  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
You'd be his if only he'd call  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
That's the time you miss him most of all  
  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
You'd be his if only he'd call  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
That's the time you miss him most of all

In times when my head  
Was together about you  
I was an expert at silence.  
I enjoyed the blonds in their red jeeps  
Stopping you on the street  
Knowing none could compare with me  
In my my airy skirts and cool retreats  
  
In times when my head was together about you  
I was an expert at silence  
You could have told the truth all the time  
I was that at ease in side  
You never made me cry  
And then one night I lied  
I got down with a boy in the backwoods  
I didn't tell you and you didn't see  
And that's when jealousy got the dog up in me  
  
Now every look you get  
Seems like another threat  
I pick your pockets almost hoping to find  
Something to hurt about, to prove you unkind  
  
Oh but I still love you baby  
Though now I just can't sit still  
And though that boy meant nothing to me  
I believe I've lost that simple thrill of the...

A sweet young man sat on my chair  
With a tape machine and a face of fear  
He asked how does it feel to be who you are  
I thought, this boy really thinks I'm a star  
I answered him with humility  
And then asked him if he'd like some tea  
  
Interview, who's interviewing who  
Are you interviewing me  
Or am I interviewing you  
  
He asked if the rug was some ancient, lovely thing  
I lied and said "Yes a gift from a king"  
I watched his arms and how his lips moved  
He asked me if my parents approved  
He asked to see my Ruby ring  
And if as a child I had liked to sing  
  
Interview, who's interviewing who  
Are you interviewing me  
Or am I interviewing you  
  
I said yes, Oh yes 400 times  
"You're so open" he said "do you always tell the truth?"  
"Never," I said, "What's that?"  
  
But how would it feel to hold me in your arms  
You could get to know me down on the farm  
Then you could see me as the child I've become  
'Cause being grown up can be so lonesome  
Baby, how would it feel to hold me now  
Baby, how would it feel to hold me now  
  
Interview, who's interviewing who  
Are you interviewing me  
Or am i interviewing you

It happens everyday  
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay  
Together, they decide to separate  
Just how it happens, neither is certain  
But it happens everyday  
  
It happens everyday  
After you break up, you say these words to your friends  
"How could I have loved that boy?"  
"He was so bad to me in the end"  
Well, you make him a liar  
Turn him into a robber  
Well, it happens everyday  
  
But I don't regret that I loved you  
How I loved you, I will never forget  
And in time I'll look back and remember  
The boy that I knew when we first met  
  
Still, it happens everyday  
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate  
But am I so different from that young girl you used to date?  
You used to adore me  
(You used to adore me)  
Still, it happens everyday  
  
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Everyday, yeah, yeah, yeah

I think of you now and then  
But I remember when love was new  
And you were mine, my love  
So why would we pretend  
We were lovers and now we're friends  
I don't want to say goodbye to you  
Again, my love  
  
[Chorus]  
It should have been me  
That's lovin' you instead of someone else  
I needed you but how was I to know  
It should have been me  
That's holding you through all the lonely nights  
I knew that I should never let you go,  
My love  
  
What we once had is gone  
No tears, no right, no wrong  
It could never be the same again, my love  
The more we see the less we know  
Now you believe our love will grow  
I don't want to say goodbye to you again,  
My love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My love, how would I survive  
With another broken heart  
On my own again  
When I need a friend  
To help me find a place to start  
  
[Chorus]

I remember a time, rompin' through the woods  
Sun against our skin instead of clothes  
When we felt hungry we would eat, whn we felt glad we would dance  
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze  
  
It was so easy then never takin' any stands  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
I remember a time when our fears could be named  
And courage meant not refusing dares  
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks,  
No only on the squares  
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears  
  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
And now we are grown, with debts and regrets  
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes  
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams  
Love can lead a normal woman to extremes  
  
It was so easy once, holdin' hands without a plan  
It was so easy once holdin' hands  
Just holdin' hands

it's hard to be tender  
it's hard to stay open  
when you're dizzy with anger  
and your dreams have been broken  
lying with you 'neath the sky  
the country is so green in the light  
loving you's the key to my survival  
now, you have gone away  
the skies turned grey  
the rivers froze  
I remember how you held me close  
and I shiver  
it's hard to be tender  
it's hard to stay open  
when the woods are on fire  
and the river is frozen  
swore on my knees as a child  
never to forsake God above  
never to betray the ones who love me  
now, years have come and gone  
I find the strength to carry on  
but the blood that ran so fast and warm  
has grown colder  
now, my heart has turned to ice  
is it just the price of growing older?  
it's hard to be tender  
but I'm tired of defending  
I know that I love you  
so I'll write my own ending

Last night when we were young  
Love was a star, a song unsung  
Life was so new, so real,  
So bright, ages ago, last night  
  
Today, the world is old  
You flew away, and time grew cold  
Where is that star  
That seems so bright  
Ages ago, last night  
  
To think that spring had depended  
On merely this, a look, a kiss  
To think that something so splendid  
Could slip away in one little daybreak  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung,  
When we were young last night  
  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung,  
When we were young last night  
Last night, oooooh, last night, ooooooh, last night

Lead-in with haunting:  
There's always someone,  
Haunting someone, haunting someone,  
I can't sleep easy,  
Cause I'm afraid of dreaming  
And then the memory of the dream  
There's always someone,  
Haunting someone, haunting someone  
  
Laura is the face in the misty night  
Footsteps that you hear down the hall  
The laugh that floats on a summer's night  
That you might never quite recall  
And you see Laura on a train  
That is passing through  
Those eyes how familiar they seem  
She gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura but she's only a dream  
  
She gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura  
But she's only a dream  
  
Yes she gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura, but she's only a dream  
A dream, a dream

Well I have known you  
Since you were a small boy  
And your mama used to say  
"My boy is gonna grow up and be  
Some kind of leader some day"  
  
Then you'd turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Your mama would say to you  
"This isn't exactly what we had planned"  
  
But you're a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.  
  
And though I know you  
Still have the heart of that small boy  
Well, you lend it out far too much  
And no one woman loving you  
Can ever feel that she's been really touched.  
  
Then you turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Think kind of sadly to yourself  
This isn't exactly what you had planned.  
  
But you're a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.  
  
Well a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.

Outside the barracks by the corner light  
Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night  
There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you  
The whole night through, was there that you'd whisper tenderly  
That you loved me, you'd always be  
Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene  
  
I'd give you a rose to show I care,  
And wind it through your golden hair  
Then we would say goodnight and part,  
I'll always keep you in my heart  
With me Lili Marlene, with me Lili Marlene  
  
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene

When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
The circus tent was strong with every star in the sky  
Above the ring I loved so well  
  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsel and the gold  
Sit there and count your fingers  
What can you do old girl, you're through  
Sit there and count your little fingers  
Unlucky little girl blue  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time that you knew  
All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
No use old girl you may as well surrender  
You hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer a little girl blue  
  
No use old girl you may aswell surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody lend a tender  
Blue boy to cheer a little girl blue

Little Mr. Roo  
Reaching up  
For the moon  
So many things  
You've got to do  
And no time  
For dreaming  
  
Little Mr. Roo  
Let the stars  
Shine over you  
Don't grow up  
Too fast  
Too soon  
Save some time  
For dreaming  
  
Settle in  
Settle down  
Let me see  
That sleepy yawn  
On your face  
Close your eyes  
I will love you  
Completely  
And always  
  
Little Mr. Roo  
The moon shines  
Silver over you  
No one knows  
You like I do  
And little Mr. Roo  
Reaching  
For the moon  
Don't grow up  
Too fast  
Too soon

Lobster quadrille  
With lucy simon  
Writer lewis caroll  
  
"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. "There's a
porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the
lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle - will
you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will
you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join
the dance? "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they
take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea! " But the snail
replied "Too far, too far! " and gave a look askance - Said he thanked the
whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would
not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not,
could not, could not join the dance. "What matters it how far we go? " his
scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France - Then turn not pale,
beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
won't you join the dance? "

Won't you give me all your limes  
And I will give you a reason  
I'll rub them on my body  
And smell like the West Indies  
  
And when I'm feelin' like the islands  
And I'm giving you all my sighs  
I beg you when you love me  
Look me in the eyes  
  
It's your heat that makes me warm  
Makes me climb on you like a tree  
And I don't need no fancy dancing  
When you bend over me  
  
We'll be like two lazy sunbathers  
Swaying palm trees against the sky  
And I beg you when you love me  
Look me in the eyes

I'm lost in your love  
Lost in my love for you  
Everything that you say  
Everything that you do  
I'm lost in your love  
  
I can find me a night  
So lovely it might even change me  
I can find me the place where mornings come from  
But I'm lost when it comes to you  
  
I'm lost in your love  
So lost in my love for you  
And I can't see your face  
'Cause I'm tumbling through space  
I'm lost in your love  
  
Find me  
Take me  
Hold me  
I can't let you go free  
'Til you lose your love in me  
  
I'm lost in your love  
Lost in my love for you  
Everything that you say  
Everything that you do  
I'm lost in your love

I love lilacs and avocados  
Ukuleles and fireworks  
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow  
But you've got to know that  
  
You're the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
From the moment I first saw you  
The second that you were born  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Quite simply the love of my life  
  
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread  
The Statue Of Liberty and standing ovations  
And falling into bed  
But get it through your head that  
  
You're the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
From the moment I first saw you  
The second that you were born  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Quite simply the love of my life  
  
You an drive me crazy  
You can drive me anywhere  
Here are the keys  
Just do as you please  
It may not always be easy  
  
But you're the love of my life  
My heart is riding on a runaway train  
You are the love of my life  
Through all the pleasure and pain  
From the moment I first saw you  
I knew it right away  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Simply the love of my life  
You are the love  
The great love of my life.

I've seen the sidewalks  
And I've been aware  
Of the lamps and tables and the paperback books  
That you throw out there  
All your artifacts  
In disrepair  
Make up a pile so high  
Could tie up the traffic in the thoroughfare  
  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street tonight  
  
I don't mind your sinning  
I'm no saint myself  
And if the neighbours call you a hellcat  
Then let them call me a Jezebel  
Cause I've come to know you  
I've come to know you so well  
From spying on you from my bathroom window  
In this cheap hotel  
  
So let flow the hydrants  
And we'll dance in the spray  
And we'll wash out our dirty laundry  
In the alleyway

The lies that you tell will leave you alone  
They'll keep you down,  
they'll catch you and trip you up  
Keep you hangin' around  
  
The habit is old, you don't need it anymore  
Go on and kiss it goodbye  
'Cause you got me, and I can see  
Who you really are  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
I'm right here beside you  
there's nobody else to set you straight  
To shake you, to let you know  
That it's still not too late  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
Don't make up stories,  
I know you by your eyes  
I think I know what's inside  
  
The streets you've been on  
Will leave you out in the cold  
But you know I care,  
And years from now  
We'll both look down from the top of the stairs  
Here I've shown you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart

It should have been so soft, this morning as we left  
But the valley was infected, by a different kind of beauty  
And the Indians they knew, it was a devil's sanctuary.  
  
Out of this unholy dawn, a car came stirring up the sand  
And a woman from a passion play  
Held up the limousine that brought me  
All this way today. And I didn't need to turn around  
So strong was the message, and the man who planned her life  
Commanded all that followed: Well they bellowed, and they hollered  
And they threw each other down, down in this valley  
This cruel and lovely valley, Oh it should have been an alley  
In some low down part of town  
  
As the lights came up, there was no sun  
And brandy splattered all over the ground  
As this woman with her head held high  
Yelled love and why oh why, you're killing me oh follow me-  
As I watched safe and clean, from the frosted windows of that limousine  
  
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down  
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley  
Oh it should have been an alley, in some low down part of town  
  
Before he'd been so funny, imagining the best:  
That he'd escape recrimination, for abandoning the nest  
He'd been joking and stoned, while he was entertaining me  
But then turned and was stunned, by her panic and her misery  
  
And I was in the get-away car  
Giving him a chance, to get away  
Get away, get away  
  
And how the valley smoked, as he crossed Route 25  
With his cymbals and his shattered crown, leaving all alone  
His eyes fixed on the ground. And he didn't even turn around  
So strong was the message, and he fell into the shallow sky  
And was swallowed.  
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down  
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley  
Well it should have been an alley, In some low down part of town

Peter's on the loose  
I'd like to see him again  
I remember when  
We made love  
On the jetty in the rain.  
When the fishing boats would  
Come back in  
At the end of the day  
He'd run up the hill to my cabin  
With a swordfish and he'd say:  
"Girl I want you all over again"  
All over again  
  
[Chorus]  
In Menemsha, Menemsha  
Menemsha, Menemsha  
  
The sunset on the sound  
Were almost too much to take  
We would dance on the hill  
With our friends  
'Til the morning would break  
Everybody drank too much beer  
In those days  
Thank God it wasn't whisky  
Or we'd all be dead  
And Peter and me we'd pull the shades  
Everyone was interested  
In Peter and me  
  
[Chorus]

I've got my mind on my man  
I've got my man on my mind  
He's everything to me, he's somthin' more special  
Than any amount of lookin's gonna find  
  
I'm not hooked on any her from an idle dream  
But I'm idly dreaming of him  
He's a lotus, that opens and closes  
Notice he won't always let me in  
So my mind is on my man, got my man on my mind  
  
Sometimes he's sleepy  
And I don't think he loves me  
I worry about his lovin'  
Ain't I crazy?  
  
He's a Northern baby and a Southern child  
He's a gentleman lost at the fair  
He's a cowboy gettin' drunk at the Plaza  
He has a place in my heart anywhere  
And my mind is on my man, got my man on my mind

There are plenty of late nights  
If you want to stay up for them  
You'll just want to find yourself a friend  
And tie a couple on in a night spot  
Draw pictures of your soul, win the jackpot  
For tears in your beer  
It's hip to be miserable when you're young and intellectual  
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit  
  
Come on home with me  
We'll turn on the TV  
About 10 o'clock we'll turn off the light  
Not every man was born to stay up late at night  
  
There are plenty of boats to catch  
If you notice all the sails in the wind  
But you better look hard my friend  
In case you catch a ride on the wrong one  
In the distance is the one you belong on  
Oh the water is wide  
It's hip to be miserable when you're young and intellectual  
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit  
  
Come on home with me  
We'll sit under a tree  
And if you get the itch  
I'll supply the scratch  
Not every man was born with a boat to catch  
  
It's hip to be miserable when you are young and intellectual  
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit  
A misfit

Everybody have you heard?  
He's gonna buy me a mockingbird  
And if that mockingbird won't sing  
He's gonna buy me a diamond ring  
And if that diamond ring won't shine  
He's gonna surely break this heart of mine  
And that's why I keep on tellin' ev'rybody, sayin'  
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo  
  
Hear me now and understand  
He's gonna find me some peace of mind  
And if that peace of mind won't stay  
I'm gonna find myself a better way  
And if that better way ain't so  
I, I, I'll ride with the tide and go with the flow  
And that's why I keep on shoutin' in your ear sayin'  
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo  
  
Everybody have you heard?  
She's gonna buy me a mockingbird  
And if that mockingbird won't sing  
She's gonna buy me a diamond ring  
And if that diamond ring won't shine  
She's gonna surely break this heart of mine  
And that's why I keep on tellin' ev'rybody, sayin' no, no, no, no,no  
  
Listen now and understand  
She's gonna find me some peace of mind  
And if that peace of mind won't stay  
I'm gonna find myself a better way  
I might rise above , I might go below  
I, I, I'll ride with the tide and go with the flow  
And that's why I keep on shoutin' in your ears y'all  
No, no, no, no, no, no, now, now, baby

It must have been Moonglow,  
Way up in the blue,  
It must have been Moonglow,  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you sayin'  
Dear one hold me fast,  
And I start to prayin'  
Oh Lord, please let this last,  
We seem to float right through the air,  
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere,  
And now when there's Moonglow,  
Way up in the blue,  
I always remember,  
That Moonglow gave me you  
That Moonglow gave me you  
  
We seem to float right through the air,  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere,  
And now when there's Moonglow  
Way up in the blue,  
I always remember,  
That Moonglow gave me you,  
That Moonglow gave me you,  
That Moonglow gave me you

I stand at your gate.  
And the song that I sing is of moonlight.  
I stand and I wait  
For the touch of your hand in the June night.  
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade.  
  
The stars are aglow.  
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming.  
My love, do you know  
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?  
I bring you, and I sing you a moonlight serenade.  
  
Let us stray 'til break of day  
In love's valley of dreams.  
Just you and I, a summer sky,  
A heavenly breeze, kissin' the trees.  
  
So don't let me wait.  
Come to me tenderly in the June night.  
I stand at your gate  
And I sing you a song in the moonlight.  
A love song, my darling, a moonlight serenade

I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a melody  
To let you know that I love you  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a song to sing  
To let you know that it's the real thing  
  
I want to make us be  
You and me  
In close harmony  
I want to make us be  
You and me  
In close harmony  
  
Serenades and symphonies  
Lullabyes and sweet melodies  
We'll make romantic rhapsodies  
Music, maestro, if you please  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a love affair  
Cause, darlin', you can find that anywhere  
  
lay your head upon my breast  
Fondle me with your tenderness  
We've got the key to happiness  
Close your eyes and I'll do the rest  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than even life itself  
I wouldn't settle for nothing else

It's a mother's intuition to make a little space  
It's her quiet mission to tidy up her place  
A mother's intuition is like a kangaroo's  
She hops around, she mops the ground, she fusses over you  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
It's a mother's intuition to wash her baby  
Well, she won't forget behind the ears  
And the extra soap suds on the tail  
A mother's into cleaning, she'll clean until she's through  
She's smart enough, she's wise enough to add up two and two  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
A mother has a feeling, she pays special attention  
If someone is concealing, if someone's playing tricks  
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets  
Until the answer clicks  
Then she takes a brush and polishes your teeth  
She'll make you shine and sparkle new  
Until she finds the real you underneath  
Isn't it charming?  
Just mommy and little roo  
Fresh as a daisy  
Sparkling just like new  
It's a mother's intuition  
It's a mother's intuition  
It's a mother's intuition  

My Bonnie lies over the ocean, my Bonnie lies over the sea,  
My Bonnie lies over the ocean, O bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me, to me:  
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
O blow ye winds over the ocean,  
O blow ye winds over the sea.  
O blow ye winds over the ocean,  
And bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
Last night as I lay on my bed,  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The winds have blown over the ocean,  
The winds have blown over the sea,  
The winds have blown over the ocean,  
And brought back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank,  
The height of its contents to see,  
I lit a small match to assist her,  
O Bring back my Bonnie to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow,  
Last night as I lay on my bed,  
I stuck my feet out of the window,  
In the morning the neighbors were dead.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My mother makes beer in the bathtub,  
My father makes synthetic gin,  
My sister makes fudge for a quarter,  
Wouldja believe how the money rolls in?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My mother, she drowned in the bathtub,  
My father, he died from his gin,  
My sister choked on her chocolate,  
My stars, what a fix I am in.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I tried making beer in the bathtub,  
I tried making synthetic gin,  
I tried making fudge for a living,  
Now look at the shape that I'm in.

He never makes me feel ashamed  
He bounces me high up on his back  
He gives me the gold hat when I'm jump attacked  
  
My new boyfriend, my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid  
My new boyfriend, ooh, my new boyfriend  
  
He call in the trumpets for a laugh  
He show me the way it was in Spain  
He give me the golly when I'm too insane  
  
My new boyfriend, my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isn't just a baby  
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid  
My new boyfriend, ooh, my new boyfriend  
  
he loves the living daylights out of me  
He springs a ladder to the moon  
He sings the far side of the tune  
  
He's a driven, silver lover  
He can swim under the covers  
He's a high, gold bouncing lover  
  
He's a diver and a dreamer  
He's a dolphin in the ocean  
He's a rival of Orion

The very thought of you makes my heart sing  
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring  
And you appear in all your splendor  
My one and only love  
  
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms  
In the hush of night while you're in my arms  
I feel your lips so warm and tender  
My one and only love  
  
The touch of your hand is like heaven  
A heaven that I've never known  
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak  
Tells me that you are my own  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender  
My one and only love  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender  
My one and only love

My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky  
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by  
No month of may, no twinkling stars  
No hide away, no softly guitars  
  
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain  
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain  
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true  
  
My romance doesn't need a thing but you  
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

The wind is coming up strong and fast  
And the moon is smiling on me  
Miles from nowhere so small at last  
In between the sky and the sea  
  
I'm bound for the island  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it before dawn  
It's night on the ocean  
I'm going home  
And it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone  
  
Seagulls cry and the hills are green  
And my friends are waiting for me  
Freak ambition is all a dream  
Let me drown my pride in the sea  
  
I'm bound for the ocean  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it by dawn  
It's night on the ocean  
I'm going home  
And it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone  
Oh it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone

A catfish he tends to groove on the water  
It's just where he's bound to be  
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas  
So he lives in the top of a tree  
But my eyes are made for darkness  
And so the nighttime is right for me  
  
Said I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Now most folks they like the good day time  
They like to see the shining sun  
They're up in the morning  
Off and running  
'Till they're too tired for having fun  
But when the sun goes down  
And them bright light shine  
My daytime has just begun  
  
I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Said turn off that bright light, baby  
You're just about to drive me blind  
Draw them curtains for me, mama  
You watch and you'll see  
How my love light shines  
  
Now, there's two sides to this  
Great big world  
And one of them is always night  
Hey, if you can take care of  
Business in the sunshine, baby  
I guess you're gonna be alright  
But don't come looking for string bean  
To lend you a hand  
Because my eyes they can't stand the light  
  
No, I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all, sleep all day long  
I said sleep all day long  
I'm a night owl, honey

We have no secrets  
We tell each other everything  
About the lovers in the past  
And why they didn't last  
We share a cast of characters from a to z  
We know each others fantasies  
And though we know each other better when we explore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
The water was cold  
The beach was empty but for one  
Now you were lying in the sun  
Wanting and needing no-one  
Then some child came, you never asked for her to come  
She drank a pint of your rum  
And later when you told me  
You aid she was a bore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
In the name of honesty, in the name of what is fair  
You always answer my questions  
But they don't always answer my prayers  
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never, never, never knew  
Some of those secrets of yours  
Some of those secrets of yours  
Some of those secrets of yours  
We have no secrets  
Telling each other most everything now

Nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby, you're the best  
  
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me  
It tried to hide from your love light  
But like heaven above me  
The spy who loved me  
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight  
  
And nobody does it better  
Though sometimes I wish someone could  
Nobody does it quite the way you do  
Why'd you have to be so good?  
  
The way that you hold me  
Whenever you hold me  
There's some kind of magic inside you  
That keeps me from runnin'  
But just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?  
  
Oh, and nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best  
  
Baby you're the best  
Darlin', you're the best  
Baby you're the best  
  
Oh, oh, oh

Not a day goes by  
Not a single day  
But you're somewhere a part of my life  
And it looks like you'll stay  
As the days go by  
I keep thinking when does it end  
Where's the day I'll have started forgetting  
But I just go on thinking and sweating  
  
And cursing and crying  
And turning and reaching  
And waking and dying  
And no, not a day goes by  
Not a blessed day  
But you're still somehow part of my life  
And you won't go away  
So there's hell to pay  
And until I die  
I'll die day after day after day  
After day  
After day after day after day  
Til the days go by  
Til the days go by  
Til the days go by

She rides in the front seat,  
She's my older sister  
She knows her power over me  
She goes to bed an hour later than I do  
When she turns the lights out  
What does she think about?  
And what does she do in the daylight  
That makes her so great?  
  
Oh but to be,  
Oh but to be,  
Oh but to be,  
I'd like to be  
My older sister  
  
She flies throught the back door,  
She's my older sister  
She throws French phrases 'round the room  
She has ice skates and legs that fit right in  
She's wicked to all the beaming dreamers  
Who'll later boast of an evening  
By her fiery side  
  
Oh but to be,  
Oh but to be,  
Oh but to be,  
I'd like to be  
My older sister  
  
And in her black gymnastic tights  
She runs into some elastic nights  
Sophisticated sister sings for the  
Soldiers of the soccer team  
Their silver I.D.'s and sororities  
They tinker with love in their Model T's  
Oh lord, won't you let me be her for just one day  
  
She turns everybody's heads  
While I wear her last year's threads  
With patches and stitches and a turned up hem  
  
Oh, but to be,  
Oh but to be,  
I'd like to be,  
Just once to be  
My older sister

It's been a one man show that I've been runnin'  
On a two way street for love  
And I see no end to this dead end 'til you come back home  
And I've tried everything to keep remembering  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
To make a one love stand  
The only thing that hurts is the memory  
Of having once lived by myself  
And I tried every kind of hustlin' man, put my love out on a shelf  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
I feel at home in a foreign land  
You know what's next when there's nothing planned  
I'm talking 'bout love, you know it takes two  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
It takes a woman and one good man  
To make a one love stand  

One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.  
  
"Come on girl"  
You said to me, "Let's fly away  
Follow me wherever I will go  
And we won't worry about tomorrow"  
  
One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.  
  
So things go  
And so you left, and we drifted apart  
Sorrow came, built in my heart a home  
And now I'm thinking about tomorrow.  
  
One more time  
Play it again before you put your guitar down  
My darlin', one more time  
Now that you got me dreamin'  
About the good times.

People say a lot when they want the job, yeah  
Lining up sideways around the block  
"It's not for the money" she say to you  
Almost convincing herself that it's true  
"I'll take care of your dog when you're away"  
"I don't mind working Saturdays"  
"When you wanna work I'll work with you", she say  
"And I'll go on working when you wanna play"  
"Nothing gonna hurt you when I'm around"  
"I'll keep my eyes wide open and my nose to the ground"  
"I'll be like a mama with a baby cub"  
  
[Chorus]  
People say a lot when they want the job  
People say a lot when they want the job, yeah  
People say a lot when they want the job  
  
When you begin to see a sinister gleam  
You're locked in too tight on the same team  
There's a little holiday in her heart  
When she sees you slip up, Ah  
It's like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up  
Ooops, then down again  
She'll sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin  
When her tears spill out, crocodile chagrin  
It's her contempt for you, she thinks you're a slob  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Greatest cook to bring a meal (didn't need a recipe)  
Said she'll also deal the cards (dealt the knave and two and three)  
Said she also feel the thrill of the willow in the wind  
(Feel the thrillo the willow, or oak or elm or ash or pine sol)  
  
It's already too late when she's reading your mail  
Calling your agent and making the deal  
She'll just copy and paste it and make it last  
Nothing is sacred about your past  
  
She'll tell of the poppies in the July fest  
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest  
"You could go to jail, fail all the tests"  
"Forget your keys and your secrets and your little black box"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was awfully good at fire (fiery fiery hussy burn)  
She burned bridges where she could (she really couldn't burn them very well)  
She turned young men into torches (burning scarecrow)  
She had a way with wood (do away with wood, do away with wood)  
  
People say a lot when they want the job  
Lining up eager around the block  
Promising, promising never to quit  
Well it's a full time job to be a hypocrite  
Maybe they remember that they've done it before  
Practicing, with their dolls on the floor  
The lie itself becoming the seed  
The messy mascara, the future deed  
The actor's bow, the junkie's need  
They line up again just to wipe you clean  
  
They line up again just to wipe you out  
Line up again around the block  
A mighty force of youth for hire  
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Tell me Phoebe, do you want someday to have an award like that of your own?"  
  
"More than anything else in the world"  
  
"Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one  
Miss Harrington knows all about it"

Play  
You can play with me  
But take it easy  
Have  
You can have your fun  
But only with me  
  
I've had  
Some big time winners  
Played games  
You'd never imagine  
I'd know  
But now I'm ready  
To quit those sinners  
I've turned myself  
Into the ground  
And now  
I feel so slow  
  
Put a smile on my face  
But don't bloodshot  
My eyes  
The love  
That you give to me  
Has enough surprise  
  
Baby  
You know what I was  
You've seen me  
At parties before  
And don't cha know  
That all  
That running around  
Was wild and gay  
But in the end  
Just a bore  
  
So play  
You can play with me  
But take it easy  
I said take it easy  
Take is easy

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him  
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh  
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk  
Hoping that you won't pass him by  
  
Should you stop? Better not, much too busy  
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly  
In the distance the ringing of laughter  
And in the midst of the laughter he cries  
  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue  
Wrap your presents to your darling from you  
Pretty pencils to write I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Quiet  
Such a quiet  
It's a quiet  
  
Won't somebody tell me  
Won't you let me know  
Quiet evening  
I'm sleepy  
And I'm holding on  
I've got nowhere to go  
Quiet evening  
You know  
You still have friends  
And they'll be  
Waiting for you  
  
Quiet evening  
You've been longing for  
Quiet evening  
You've been longing  
Take this night  
For the sake  
Of your soul  
  
Moonlight calls  
And it covers you  
There's nothing left  
But this hidden view  
Quiet evening  
Cars roll by  
On that motorway  
Others may  
Have a lot to say  
Quiet eveining  
You know  
You still have friends  
And they'll be  
Waiting for you  
  
Quiet evening  
You've been longing for  
Quiet evening  
You've been longing  
Some people might stay up  
Til it's light  
But take this night  
For the sake of your soul  
  
Quiet  
It's a quiet  
Quiet  
It's a quiet

First one in the city  
Wearin' all those grass stained jeans  
Nothing is forgotten, everyone is pleased.  
Someone got his hair cut  
The girls have lots to say  
His friends had felt more comfortable  
With it worn the other way  
And I don't know if I'll see you again.  
  
Next one at the old house  
Snow is on the ground  
Photographs and wine are passed around  
Someone toasts an absent friend  
Another takes his seat  
They gather round the dying fire  
But the circle's not complete  
And I don't know if I'll see you again  
  
Last one by the highway  
Wind blows through thin smiles  
Someone made a wrong turn  
Missed a joke by miles  
Someone got their hair cut  
A tear in her eye  
But no one even comments -  
Except to say 'goodbye'  
And I don't know if I'll see you again

Strange times in Portland, Maine  
Lobsters dancing on the dock  
Switzerland's been weird since they unplugged the clocks  
Man and a woman living in Brooklyn Heights  
Each convinced that the other is in the wrong  
Last year the divorce rate tripled in Hong Kong  
If through all the madness  
We can stick together  
We're safe and sound  
The world's just inside out and upside down  
  
Flash from Mexico, the tornadoes have all turned gay  
Roman whores have quit to seek a better way  
Dope has undermined the morale of the Buckingham Palace guards  
Motorcycle gangs ride naked down Hollywood Boulevard  
If through all the madness  
We can stick together  
We're safe and sound  
The whole world's just turned inside out and upside down  
  
Marahaj wants you to lead a pilgrimage to Tibet  
New York women want me sounding off like a Suffragette  
I know that each of us is alone in the end  
But the trip still feels less dangerous when you've got a friend  
If we stick together  
You and me forever  
We're safe and sound  
The world's just turned inside out and upside down  
The world's just turned inside out and upside down

The soft winds of Buenos Aires  
Once blew into her room  
Now all she can do is kneel and pray  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
  
She's lost in the streets  
Lost in her thoughts  
She's lost in the smiles of the baby all day  
She's new in New York, dressed up like a doll  
But broken like clay  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
  
She cries when underneath the crystal moon  
She hears a sultry Spanish song  
But coming from that neighborhood saloon  
It sounds all wrong  
  
Puts the child in the stroller  
And walks through the park  
"What a beautiful baby you have"  
The women all say  
"Thank you" she says, pretending it's hers  
Her own is so far away  
  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce

Here come the priests, each one wailing and bemoaning  
Lordy, they got their heads bowed down  
Here come the madmen, they're too excited for atoning:  
"Burn the mosque," they're shouting, "Burn it down!"  
  
Save me a place, surround me with friendly faces  
All of us have gathered here to share the end  
To watch the world go up in flames  
  
Please, Lord we're not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour  
  
Here come the kings, Let's dispense with their apologizing  
Just bring on the acrobats and clowns  
Here comes the rumble, Hang on for universal dying  
Please ignore the baying of the hounds  
  
Save me a place, surround me with deadly faces  
All of us have gathered here to share the end -  
To watch the world go up in flames  
  
Please, Lord we're not ready  
Give us some time to work things out  
Please, Lord we're not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour  
Please, Lord we're not ready  
Give us some time to work things out  
Please, Lord we're not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour
