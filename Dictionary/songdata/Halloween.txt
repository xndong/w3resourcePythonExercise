I'm a ghost, my name is Bill,  
I live in a haunted house up on the hill.  
All day long, all by myself,  
I don't have to share with anyone else.  
  
Halloween night, kids come around,  
They knock on my door, from all over town.  
They open the door 'cause they think it's ok.  
I'll show you what I do to scare'em away.  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.  
  
They look through the windows, look through the doors,...  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.  
  
They get really scared when they hear me say boo!...  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.

Do you know about a day  
That's not so very far away  
Everywhere there's orange and black  
And chills are running up your back.  
  
Jack-o-lanterns and ghosts and bats,  
Witches and goblins and big black cats  
Spooky spooks come out to play  
On the thirty-first, Halloween Day.  
  
Let's pick a costume we can wear  
And all the neighbors, we will scare  
When at their door we trick or treat  
And they will give us something sweet.  
  
Jack-o-lanterns and ghosts and bats,  
Witches and goblins and big black cats  
Spooky spooks come out to play  
On the thirty-first, Halloween Day.  
  
Today is a super busy day at school, but in between trick-or-treating
throughout the building, visiting the "haunted hallway" complete with a
"graveyard", and celebrating at a huge party in the gym this afternoon, we'll
find some time to squeeze in music therapy.  
  
Though my feelings toward Halloween are lukewarm at best, I am trying my best
to get into the spirit for the sake of those who enjoy this spooktacular day.
Tonight, Zach (my husband) and I are going to attend a Halloween party dressed
as a certain singing duo... any guesses? (Hint: if only I had an autoharp, my
costume would be perfect.)

Chorus:  
Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en night,  
Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en night.  
  
Encourage your children to make up their own verses to reflect the costumes
they'll be wearing.  
Below are some sample verses for inspiration!  
  
I'm gonna be a ghost, gonna wear a funny sheet  
Gonna scare everybody, I meet along the street  
You'll see me at the door, with all my spooky friends  
Screaming for candy, with wide open hands.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a fairy princess, as pretty as can be  
Dancing from door to door, you'll really love me.  
I'm looking for a prince, who won't give me a fright  
We'll live happily ever after, well at least for tonight.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a cavegirl, living years ago  
Playing with the dinosaurs, it's fun to watch them go  
You'll see me on the street, with clothing made of fur  
With all my spooky monster friends, who are gonna cause a stir.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a witch, put snakes in my hair,  
Everyone will run away, but I don't really care.  
I'll look really freaky, riding on my broom  
My cat will be behind me, screeching at the moon  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a cowboy, a-ridin' on the range  
I'll be ridin' on my horse, and I'll be acting really strange  
I won't be making spooky sounds, I won't be saying 'boo'  
But I'll be riding  
  
Rap:  
Spooky, spooky, very spooky,  
Don't look at me cause I'm too kooky  
Kooky, kooky, very kooky,  
Give me a treat, give me a cookie  
Cookie, cookie, come and lookie,  
Look at the way I eat my cookie.

The wind is gonna be scary,  
Scary this Halloween.  
It'll sound just like a thousand ghosts and goblins  
When they scream.  
  
You can hear it howling,  
Shrieking in the sky.  
It'll make your mamma hide her head  
And make your daddy cry.  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind will make you nervous,...  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind is gonna be chilly...  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind is gonna be scary...

Chorus:  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
Boooooo! I'm a boogeyman  
  
Well, I boogey with a dog, I boogie with a cat  
Boogey with a bird, boogey with a rat  
Boogey with a horse, boogie with a cow  
I love to boogie let me show you how!  
Booooo... !  
I'm a boogie man  
  
Chorus  
Well I boogey at night, boogey in the day  
Boogey at work, boogey at play  
There's boogey in my toes, boogie in my head  
And I 'll probably still boogey, when I'm dead  
Booo... !  
I'm a boogie man  
  
We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are  
We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are  
Boooo... ! We're the boogey girls  
  
We can boogey on a mountain, boogey in the sea  
We can boogie on the ground, boogie in the sky  
So let's all boogie with Mr. I.  
Booo... !  
We're the boogie girls.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
I'm a boogey man, oh yes I am  
Booooo! I'm a boogie man!

I was working in the lab late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
  
CHORUS - (change pronouns (he, they, she) as needed)  
He did the mash  
He did the monster mash  
The monster mash  
It was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash  
It caught on in a flash  
He did the mash  
He did the monster mash  
  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
  
REPEAT CHORUS HERE  
  
The zombies were having fun  
The party had just begun  
The guests included Wolf Man  
Dracula and his son  
  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist  
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my monster mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living, this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you  
  
REPEAT CHORUS

This man kept wishin that the devil would come  
And take his wife and oldest son  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
Finally one day the devil he came to take his wife and oldest son.  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snappose  
  
He put her down to take a rest,  
She throwed up her arms and hugged him the best.  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
He took her to the gates of hell she bid her friends and all farewell.  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
One little devil came rattling a chain,  
She picked up a club and beat out his brains.  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
One little devil peeked over the wall  
And said take her back pappy she'll murder us all.  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose

Well I saw the thing coming out of the sky  
It had one long horn, and one big eye  
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-wee"  
It looks like a purple people eater to me  
  
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater  
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)  
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater  
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)  
  
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree  
I said "Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me"  
I heard him say in a voice so gruff  
  
  
Well, bless my soul, rock 'n roll, flyin' purple people eater  
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flyin' purple people eater  
(We wear short-shorts)  
Friendly little people eater  
What a sight to see (Oooh)  
  
And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground  
And he started to rock, really rockin' around  
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune  
Singin' bop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom  
  
Well bless my soul, rock 'n' roll, flyin' purple people eater  
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flyin' purple people eater  
  
Flyin' purple people eater  
What a sight to see (Purple people?)  
  
And then he went on his way, and then what do you know  
I saw him last night on a TV show  
He was a blowin' it out, and really knockin' them dead  
Playin' rock 'n roll music through the horn in his head

By Mr. I and the Rainbow Singers  
  
Chorus:  
Pumpkin patch, pumpkin patch,  
Headin' out to the pumpkin patch  
Pumpkin patch, pumpkin patch  
Headin' out to the pumpkin patch  
  
Pumpkins are pretty sneaky, they like to hide in the fields  
Under a leaf, under a bush, they keep perfectly still  
It's a good thing that they're orange, or they'd be hard to see  
Gonna catch me one of them pumpkins, a special one for me.  
  
Chorus  
  
Pumpkins aren't very scary, unless you give them a face  
A smile or a frown, eyes up or down, teeth all over the place  
Gonna carve me one of them pumpkins, put a candle inside to burn  
Then instead of a pumpkin, it'll be a jack o'lantern  
  
Hey hey, I'm goin' today, hay ride hang on...  
Hey hey, what can I say,  
Gotta catch 'em before they're gone.  
  
Chorus  
So if you happen to see a pumpkin,  
When you're out on hallowe'en night  
Don't stop and stare, you better beware  
He'll give you an awful fright.  
Just keep on trick or treating, don't even say hello  
He might jump up, and follow you home,  
You just never know!  
  
Chorus

By Marilyn Manson  
  
Boys and girls of every age  
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?  
  
Come with us and you will see  
This, our town of Halloween

Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

Scream! This is Halloween  
Red 'n' black, slimy green  
  
Aren't you scared?  
  
Well, that's just fine

Ride with the moon in the dead of night  
  
Everybody scream, everybody scream  
  
In our town of Halloween!  
  
I am the clown with the tear-away face  
Here in a flash and gone without a trace  
  
I am the "who" when you call, "Who's there?"  
I am the wind blowing through your hair  
  
I am the shadow on the moon at night  
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright  
  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!

Tender lumplings everywhere  
Life's no fun without a good scare  
  
That's our job, but we're not mean  
In our town of Halloween  
  
In this town  
  
Don't we love it now?  
  
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise  
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back  
And scream like a banshee  
Make you jump out of your skin  
This is Halloween, everybody scream  
Wont' ya please make way for a very special guy  
  
Our man jack is King of the Pumpkin patch  
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King, now!

The very best part of Halloween  
Is getting more candy than you've ever seen.  
I've got my scariest costume on.  
I scare myself when I'm all alone.  
  
Sun goes down, I'm all dressed up,  
I set out to try my luck.  
Walkin' up and down the street,  
I knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very first house is big and dark,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very next house is big and white,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
If you go out Halloween night,  
I'll give you a tip that'll make it all right.  
Smile at everyone that you meet.  
Knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.

I told the witch doctor I was in love with you  
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me too  
And then the witch doctor, he told me what to do  
He said that...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla, bing bang  
Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla, bing bang...  
Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla, bing bang  
Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang  
Walla walla, bing bang  
  
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me true  
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me nice  
And then the witch doctor, he game me this advice  
He said to...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now, you've been keeping love from me  
Just like you were a miser  
And I'll admit I wasn't very smart  
So I went out and found myself  
A guy that's so much wiser  
And he taught me the way to win your heart  
  
My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to say  
My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to do  
I know that you'll be mine when I say this to you  
Oh, Baby...  
  
[Chorus:]
