[Normani:]  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
[Lauren:]  
And I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
[Ally:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
[Camila:]  
Make my wish come true, yeah, yeah  
[Dinah Jane:]  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
[Ally:]  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
Don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
[Camila:]  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day  
  
[Dinah Jane:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
[Ally:]  
All I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[Normani:]  
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
[Ally:]  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
[Lauren:]  
I won't make a list and send it  
To The North Pole for St. Nick  
[Camila:]  
I won't even stay awake  
To hear those magic reindeer click  
  
[Dinah Jane:]  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do?  
[All:]  
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[Ally:]  
Woah, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air  
[Dinah Jane:]  
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
[Ally:]  
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?  
Won't you please bring my baby to me?  
  
[Lauren:]  
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
[Ally:]  
I just wanna see my baby,  
Standing right outside my door  
  
[Camila:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
[Dinah Jane:]  
Make my wish come true  
[Ally:]  
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[All:]  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby

When we were together  
We were just strangers  
I was just playing around  
So I didn't wanna work it out  
No, I didn't wanna work it out  
  
Thought something was missing  
We were too different  
Baby I'm a-looking back now  
And I really should've worked it out  
Yeah, I really should've worked it out  
  
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone  
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I  
  
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you

How was I ever so dumb?  
Boy I should've known that you're the one  
Boy I should've known that you're the one  
  
So, if it's not too late,  
I just wanna know babe  
And tell me ever we could still run  
'Cause I finally know that you're the one  
Yeah, I really know that you're the one  
  
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone  
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I  
  
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you

Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more

And if the fates allow,  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now
