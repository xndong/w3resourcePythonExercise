I remember when you were born  
I felt like one lucky  
Son of a gun  
  
And when you turned into two  
I was so happy  
When you said I love you  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
I'd never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Apple of your daddy's eye  
want to be the one to hold you in the night  
Apple of your daddy's eye  
Oh, oh sleep tight  
Don't you worry gonna be alright  
  
I remember when you were three  
You were so lovely  
So very pretty  
  
And when you turned into four  
I finally realized  
What God put her here for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I had my way  
Time would stand still  
You'd stay as sweet as you are  
But time waits for no one  
It never will  
Your gonna leave me soon enough  
I'm just sad 'cause you're growing up  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
I'd never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop ever lovin' me because  
You're the apple of your daddy's eye

Right before my very eyes  
I thought that you were only fakin' it  
And like before my heart was takin' it  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
  
Yesterday it seemed to me  
My life was nothing more than wasted time  
But here today you've softly changed my mind  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise  
  
Just to be alone  
Was a little more than I could take  
Then you came to stay  
Hold me in the morning  
Love me in the afternoon  
Help me find my way  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise

Things get bad, times get tough  
Everybody knows  
You gotta be a little stronger  
Just to have the things you need  
Everybody knows  
If you try a little harder  
You're gonna live a whole lot longer  
  
Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour  
Going out and stayin' far too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
You got to believe in something  
When you believe in something  
These are the best of times  
You got to have faith in someone  
When you have faith in someone  
These are the best of times  
  
Don't give up, can't give in  
Never lose a minute  
It's a long hard road back from nowhere  
Love is not what you take out  
It's what you put back in it  
Take you chance, there's no doubt  
Everything will all work out  
  
See my way, I know where I'm goin'  
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up  
I want it all as soon as I can  
Right where I am  
  
Chorus

Moment by moment, day after day  
Trying your best to forget  
It's all behind you, it's part of the past  
You've got no time for regrets  
Time to start over with somebody new  
You've got nothing more to lose  
Out for the evening, dressed for the kill  
Leaving your troubles behind  
Dangerous places, dangerous times  
Leave with the first one you find  
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right  
Who needs tomorrow, you've got tonight  
  
There in the dark, under covers of love  
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go  
First name the last thing that you need to know  
  
In the morning you're out on the street  
Now's not the time for regrets  
Some things are done for the thrill of it all  
Some things you'll never forget  
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right  
Who needs tomorrow when you've got tonight  
  
There in the dark, under covers of love  
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go  
First name the last thing that you need to know

Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Tis the season to be jolly  
Don we now our gay apparel  
Troll the ancient Yuledite carol  
See the blazing youle before us  
Strike the harp and join the chorus  
Follow me in merry measure  
While I tell of yuletide treasure  
  
Fa la la la la, la la la la  
  
Fast away the old years passes  
Hail the new, ye las and lasses  
Sing we joyous, all together  
Heedless of the wind and weather  
  
Fa la la la la, la la la la

If you see me coming up an open road  
With an empty glass and a single rose  
Take a turn towards the shifting light  
There you'll see my shadow lost in the night  
  
Endless flight has no directions now  
To a coward's kiss from a hero's vow  
If I could find the words, I'd pick up the phone  
If I was half a man, I wouldn't sleep alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Send me no more angels on a restless wind  
All I ever wanted were the simple things  
If a love like ours means anything  
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings  
  
Oh you shook your head like a wild horse  
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North  
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach  
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time just crawls here behind my eyes  
If the scar heals, can our love survive  
Life's only purpose seems so distant now  
If there's a chance at all won't you show me how  
  
[Chorus]

Sometimes at night I lay awake,  
Just to watch you sleep, hear each breath you take.  
When the morning lights your face,  
I just want to hold you, and forget the day.  
I live and breathe your every touch  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
When you look at me across the crowded room,  
Suddenly I want to be alone with you.  
I hang on every word that leaves your lips,  
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss.  
Enough of you is not enough.  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
For so long, I've been trying to believe,  
That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.  
But it's just not there, love isn't always fair.  
  
Would you want the best for me,  
And I hope I find the kind of love you can't feel for me.  
Could you find it in your heart,  
To end this thing right now before it's gone too far  
Let me go and give me up  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
Do you love me that much?

One big happy family  
Together the rest of our lives  
As far as our friends were concerned  
Everything seemed right  
  
But that's when she told me  
She said me it was time to move on  
Just something that she kept inside  
That told me the thrill was gone  
  
And now I can't believe  
I can't believe it's over  
Suddenly it's plain to see  
She's leaving me and  
  
Even a fool can see  
There's nothing left between us  
I knew all along something was wrong  
But I did my best to deny it  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
There were times we had nothing  
And somehow we laughed through it all  
There are moments I'll never forget  
And some I wouldn't care to recall  
  
And still I can't believe  
I can't believe it's over  
Suddenly it's plain to see  
She's doesn't need me  
  
Even a fool can see  
There's nothing left between us  
I knew all along something was wrong  
But I did my best to deny it  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
Nothing more to talk about  
It's over when it's over  
In the end you both stop trying  
In the end it's oh so sad  
And you are crying  
  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
Won't ya tell me that I'm alright  
Even a fool like me  
  
Woo ooo I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
Whoa ooo ooo ooo

Some say it's just the nature of the beast  
When you love somebody so passionately  
Time has a way of stealing  
That raging fire you're feeling  
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet  
  
Those fools of little faith will never know  
Those higher places two hearts can go  
Where time is standing still  
And love will burn until  
The heaven and the earth have come and gone  
  
This fire inside for you  
Is constant as the northern star  
And you will be  
Forever in my heart  
As long as there's a river  
Searching for an endless sea  
I will always love you - Faithfully  
  
Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers  
Across the ages  
We'll hold eahc other and toast to the day  
When history's said and done  
And we'll still stand as one  
Something's were never meant to fade away  
  
This fire inside for you  
Is constant as the northern star  
And you will be  
Forever in my heart  
As long as there's a river  
Searching for an endless sea  
I will always love you - Faithfully

All through my wandering years  
I always said I was biding my time  
But alone in the dark I'd face my fears  
That no other heart would come to mine  
  
At first when you found me  
It took me a while 'til I realized  
Why I felt weak when you were around me  
Why I couldn't speak when I looked in your eyes  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you, I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
  
Oh wherever you go  
Invisible hands reach over the miles  
For every wish you make to the stars  
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
  
Everything has changed  
Since you came my way  
Cause you put the color  
In a world of grey  
And you make the love  
That carries me away  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
Feels like heaven  
Watching over me

Here I go again  
Hanging on to the bitter end  
All alone  
Nothing left to lose  
Don't want to face tomorrow  
I can't sleep tonight  
Blame it on the weather  
Till I get over you.  
Chorus:  
Feels like rain  
Feels like I'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Taking down every picture  
Hanging on every wall  
Broken dreams, painfull memories  
Like the times I never listened  
And the times I didn't try  
It's gotta be the weather  
'Cause you're not here with me  
Chorus:  
Feels like rain  
Feels like I'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And it feels like rain today  
Regretting every minute  
Since I watched you walk away  
Cause it's not the same without you  
And now the clouds are hiding  
Every sunny day  
I guess I'll stay inside again  
Cause it feels like rain today  
Feels like rain  
Feels like we'll never fall in love again  
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way  
And the clouds are hiding every sunny day  
And the storm is coming so I'm here to stay  
'Cause it feels like rain today  
Yes, it feels like rain today  
  
  

Tonight it's very clear as we're both lyin' here  
There's so many things I want to say  
I will always love you, I would never leave you alone  
  
Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret  
It breaks my heart to see you cryin'  
I don't want to lose you, I could never make it alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am a man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of  
We'll live forever, knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all  
I'm always strong when you're beside me  
I have always needed you, I could never make it alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a knight in shining armor from a long time ago  
Just in time I will save the day  
Take you to my castle far away  
  
I am a man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of  
Gonna live forever, knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
We'll live forever  
Knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
We did it all for love  
We did it all for love  
We did it all for love

God rest, you merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's pow'are  
When we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy

Merely by chance  
Very unsuspecting  
You caught my heart  
Unprotecting me  
Now I've fallen in love with you  
  
Just when I thought  
Life was free and easy  
You came along to me  
Soft and breezy  
Now I've fallen in love with you  
  
[Chorus]  
And for the first time in my life  
I know what it's like to be a happy man  
Happy man  
And for the first time in my life  
You've given me something I can't understand  
Now that I'm a happy man  
  
Be with me now  
Love me forever  
Leaving you lady  
Is something that I'd never do  
I've fallen in love with you  
  
All of my life it seems I have waited  
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true  
I've fallen in love with you  
I've fallen in love with you  
  
[Chorus]

Everybody needs a little time away  
I've heard her say  
From each other  
  
Even lovers need a holiday oooh  
Far away from each other  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to stay  
And after all that you've been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise you, baby  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just the part of me I can't let go  
  
Ooooh bup bup bup bup  
  
Couldn't stand to be kept away  
Just for a day  
From your body  
Wouldn't want to be swept away  
Far away from the one that I love  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to know  
Hold me now  
I really want to tell you I'm sorry  
I could never let you go  
  
And after all that we've been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise you  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just a part of me I can't let go  
  
I can't let go.

Dry those tears  
From your eyes  
Maybe I can help you  
A few more hours until the light  
And I will hold you  
You've waited patiently  
Don't ever doubt your faith in me  
Baby, hold on a little longer  
  
[Chorus:]  
And when the night is falling  
And it's more than you can take  
Remember that I love you  
Have a little faith  
And just like the morning  
I'll be there when you awake  
Close your eyes, right now, I'm on my way  
If you just have a little faith  
  
Even now my heart has wings  
I can't wait to see you  
As I lie beside you in my dreams  
I can't wait to touch you  
Tonight my body lives  
To cross the miles, to kiss your lips  
Baby, hold on a little longer  
  
[Chorus:]  
And when the night is falling  
And it's more than you can take  
Remember that I love you  
Have a little faith  
And just like the morning  
I'll be there when you awake  
Close your eyes, right now, I'm on my way  
If you just have a little faith  
Have a little faith in me right now  
  
[Repeat chorus and fade]

In the morning light  
Half awake and half asleep  
Have you ever laid there thinking  
Was it all a dream?  
But you reach out and she's there  
Every moment, everywhere  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have you ever felt  
How far a heart can fall  
Have you ever stayed up waiting  
For a telephone call  
Just to hear her say hello  
'Cause you miss each other so  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What it's all about  
  
And when she's far away  
Have you ever felt the need to stray  
And tried and then discovered  
It just doesn't pay  
'Cause with her, you can be true  
And with her, you can be you  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What it's all about  
  
And when the night comes down  
Can you call your house a home  
Do you dream you're still together  
And wake up alone  
Have you ever been in love  
The way that I'm in love  
Have you ever been in love?  

Not too long ago when she was mine  
I thought we would be together 'til the end of time  
That's the way it goes when you're in love  
Since she's gone there's no one else I'm thinking of  
[Chorus:]  
I need her to stay with me  
Lay me down and pray for me  
Now I know just where I stand  
Heaven help this lonely man  
  
There will never be anyone else  
Never be another one to take her place  
Might as well give up, I can't go on  
Never find another one to fill this empty space  
  
Chorus  
  
When she came to me she opened my eyes  
Suddenly life was worth living  
Now it's over for me I realize  
Nothing's the same since she's gone  
And I can't go on  
  
Repeat

There's nothing outside my window  
But the sound of the pouring rain  
It oughta be breaking my heart  
But I feel no pain  
Trying to pick up the station  
That'll carry me through this night  
Got a fire to keep me warm  
'Til I got you in my arms  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out  
  
Girl, I've been dreaming about you  
For the better part of my life  
At least I can make it without you  
One more night  
  
I'm not afraid of the thunder  
I won't run away from the storm  
Let the stars fall down and break  
I don't care how long it takes  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out  
  
There's no other love in the world  
I could want any more  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out

[Chorus]  
How many tears have you cried  
How many eyes have you dried  
How many ways have you tried  
And don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
  
How many dream have been bad  
How many nights have been sad  
How many days have you had  
When you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said tired of people sayin'  
Don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, times, times, times  
Times, times, times, times, times

You know there's something I gotta say

And I'm old enough to do things my way

Makes me feel good

Come here, baby, you're drivin' me crazy  
I can feel it  
Yeah yeah, you've got me climbin' up the wall  
  
Climbin'

Your eyes and my eyes haven't talked in quite a while  
Seems like a lifetime since I walked beside your smile  
There's a dark cloud that's hanging above  
Memories never lie  
Still we talk about the way that it was  
And I think we both know the feeling hasn't died  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try  
Da da  
  
Your touch and my touch haven't spoken for some time  
You say we've both changed and your always on my mind  
I can tell you that it's over and done but I would only lose  
Being close to the want that I want  
So go on and ask me if I'm still in love with you  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try  
Da da  
  
There was no need for you to ask - please don't ask  
You oughta know by now, ooo babe, I want you back  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night  
  
I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no  
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night

(Don't go, please don't go)  
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go  
And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go  
A love like ours is love that's hard to find  
How could we let it slip away?  
  
We've come to far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way?  
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret things we said today  
  
A love like ours is love that's hard to find  
How could we let it slip away?  
  
We've come to far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way?  
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret things we said today  
  
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby, please don't go

Everytime I wake up,  
Somewhere far away  
Drowning over minutes that were yesterday  
I wonder what you're doing  
Do you feel this way  
Are you thinking of me too?  
Looking in the mirror all I wanna see  
Is your pretty face smiling back at me  
There's nowhere in the world that  
I would rather be  
Than to be back home with you  
I'm on my way  
I promise you that I won't be long  
I just called  
Called you to say  
I miss every little little moment  
Without you  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone.  
I'm almost in your arms.  
I'm coming home.  
And back when I'm alone  
I really miss your touch  
I hold on to your picture  
And it means so much  
To know that there is someone  
Out there just for me  
And  
You feel the same way too?  
Everywhere I go I'd wish  
That You were there  
Everything I know I'd wish  
That we could share  
Everywhere I go  
Makes me miss you so,  
I'm on my way,  
I promise you that I won't be long  
I just called, called you to say  
I Miss every little moment without you  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone  
I'm Almost in your arms I'm Coming home.  
I can touch you  
Everytime I close my eyes  
Baby you can feel it,  
If you just believe I'm Coming  
Oooh I'm coming home  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone.  
I'm almost in your arms.  
I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home (mmmm).  
Uh, I'm coming home  
  

I get high when I see you go by  
My oh my.  
  
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,  
Butterflies  
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?  
It's only love and that is all,  
Why should I feel the way I do?  
It's only love, and that is all,  
But it's so hard loving you.  
  
Is it right that you and I should fight  
Ev'ry night?  
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,  
Very bright.  
  
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?  
It's only love and that is all,  
Why should I feel the way I do?  
It's only love, and that is all  
But it's so hard loving you  
Yes it's so hard loving you  
loving you

Maybe you can move into a cabin  
And near a river down a lonely winding road  
Friendly conversation  
Then you read by candlelight  
  
Every word of every story told  
Maybe you can move into the castle  
Surrounded by the ivy covered walls  
Find a bit of paradise  
  
Where no one bothers you  
Only time they come is when you call  
  
Something I never realized about the city  
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
It's been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may seem funny  
You can hide if you want, you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look, everyone I see  
Everywhere it's all the same  
  
Something I never realized about the country  
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
It's been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may sound funny  
You can hide if you want, you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look  
Everyone I see  
Everywhere it's all the same

Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
O'er the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  

See the color of roses  
Sail across America  
I couldn't wait to find you  
I'm looking for a miracle  
And somewhere out of the blue  
In the heart of getting by  
CHORUS:  
It only takes a second to learn  
It only takes a second to hurt  
And it's just like love to be the hardest thing  
It's just like love to be everything (Repeat)  
An illusion of laughter  
Lost in a desert sky  
That's how I feel without you  
I can't take another night  
Somewhere out of the blue  
From my heart and in your eyes  
CHORUS  
Oh I can feel it all  
Right or wrong I'm here  
Here for you  
CHORUS (Repeat to fade)  
  

Let is snow, let is snow  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
We've got no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let is snow  
  
It doesn't show sings of stopping  
I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let is snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying, oh, my dear  
We're still goodbyeing  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let is snow, let is snow, let is snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let is snow, let is snow  
Let is snow, let is snow

There's a man in me who's lost his way  
And he searches for his pride  
He's confused by who he's told to be  
Cause he feels the beast inside  
  
He is troubled by the changing times  
And he fears his dreams have died  
There's a man that's waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me  
  
I have lived inside my mother's eyes  
I have felt my father's heart  
I am torn between the dark and light  
But I won't be torn apart  
  
Cause there's a man in me who's unafraid  
Who only now can feel his rage  
He's been taught to hide it  
But he can no longer fight it  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me  
  
Here we are  
I didn't think we'd get this far  
We were overdue  
When it's time  
To understand the man  
Then I can love  
The woman in you  
  
There's a man that's waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me

I remember sayin'  
She came out of nowhere  
Like the devil in disguise  
I believed it when she told me  
  
That she loved me  
... tellin' lies  
  
Everybody knows her name  
Mona Mona  
Everybody knows her game  
Mona Mona  
  
She's gonna break your heart  
Mona Mona  
(She) Cut you right down  
Then she'll tear you apart  
Mona Mona  
  
You know you'd better try to forget it  
You know you're gonna live to regret it  
I'd really hate to be the one  
To tell you so (I told you so)  
  
Let me take the time to remind you  
You're better off leavin' her behind you  
I really think it's something  
That you ought a know  
You better let her go  
  
Yeah yeah, let her go  
  
Everybody knows her name  
Mona Mona  
Everybody knows her game  
Mona Mona  
  
She's gonna break your heart  
Mona Mona  
(She) Cut you right down  
Then she'll tear you apart  
Mona Mona  
  
You know you'd better try to forget it  
You know you're gonna live to regret it  
I'd really hate to be the one  
To tell you so (I told you so)  
  
Let me take the time to remind you  
You're better off leavin' her behind you  
I really think it's something  
That you ought a know  
You better let her go  
  
Don't you think you'd better let her go  
Let her go

Love like a road that never ends  
How it leads me back again  
To heartache  
I'll never understand  
Darling, I put my heart upon a shelf  
'Til the moment was right, and I told myself  
  
The next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
The next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
It will be with you  
  
Now as I look into your eyes  
Well I wonder if it's wise  
To hold you like I've wanted to before  
Tonight I was thinking that you might  
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine  
  
The next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
The next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
It will be with you  
  
Next time I'm gonna follow through  
And if it drives me crazy  
I will know better why  
The next time I try  
  
The next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
The next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
It will be with you

You really took me by surprise  
You're someone I've needed for a lifetime  
Your heart was cleverly disguised  
But it didn't look that way in my mind  
  
Tell me how can it be I was the last to know  
Darling I couldn't read what was in your mind  
To turn around and to love me  
  
Chorus  
With no explanation  
I gave you everything I had  
I didn't know that you would take it  
With sweet consideration  
And after all that we've been through  
I can't believe it's true  
Until I hear you say  
  
My mouth is still wet from our last kiss  
Was loving me your one intention  
What were the signs and the times that I missed  
Oh I need you more than I could mention  
  
I won't ever accept you leaving for someone else  
Baby and when something is wrong  
Darling I need to know  
Don't ever leave me  
  
Repeat chorus  

In the morning when I saw the light  
On the letter you left in the night  
After you had gone without saying goodbye  
Here to tell you that I'm not afraid to cry  
  
Oh, no oh, no  
Tried to find you but I lost my way  
Tried to tell you what I couldn't say  
After you had gone without telling me why  
  
I'm just here to tell you  
That I'm not afraid to cry, oh no  
And I'm not afraid to cry, oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
Not afraid to cry  
And I'm not afraid to say  
Doesn't seem the same  
When you're not around  
  
Now I'm here to tell you  
That I'm going out today  
Gonna pick-a-myself back up  
Get my feet on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not afraid--repeat

I was drivin' along at the end of the day  
I was weary and so all alone  
Looking ahead by the side of the road  
What I saw was the sign "Telephone"  
  
[Chorus]  
Talking to you is something I need  
More than I needed before  
If I ever get through won't you give me the time  
Won't you answer my call, won't you stay on the line  
  
It's a moment of truth then a shadow of doubt  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
It's never as bad when we're talkin' it out  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Answer my call, won't you stay on the line  
  
I believe I have a right to say  
What I want to say  
And I believe it but I'm keeping it to myself  
I believe I have a right to do  
What I want to do  
  
All of my life, all of my life  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
I believe I have a right to be  
Where I want to be  
I believe it and I want to be there with you  
I believe I have a right to see  
Who I want to see  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
All of my life, all of my life  
All of my life, all of my life

The whole world is talkin', drownin' out my voice  
How can I hear myself with all this noise  
But all this confusion just disappears  
When I find a quiet place where I can hear  
  
One clear voice callin' out for me to listen  
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'  
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice  
  
I'm always searchin' for which path to take  
Sometimes I'm so afraid to make mistakes  
From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears  
Just like the sound of music to my ears  
  
One clear voice callin' out for me to listen  
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'  
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice  

I am so in love with you  
I just can't deny it  
Everybody knows I can't deny it  
Everybody knows  
  
You can read me like a book  
Just like a fortune teller  
Everybody needs a fortune teller  
Telling you the very truth  
  
You bring me feelin'  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love that's taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You bring out the best in me  
With love and understanding  
Anytime I need some understanding  
You are always there  
  
And if I ever lose my way  
You're always there to guide me  
Anyone can see you're here inside me  
Anyone can see it  
  
You bring me feelin'  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love that's taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
This is our time, we have it all  
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall  
We'll work it out and get it right  
And when I get home to you  
You're such a sight for my poor eyes  
  
This is our time, we have it all  
When I come home at night  
You're such a sight for my poor eyes  
  
You bring me feelin'  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love that's taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You bring me feelin'  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love that's taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do

One more story  
Then it's time for bed  
One more fairy tale  
Then rest your weary head  
One more kiss, I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Go to sleep now  
You've had a busy day  
Hold me in your dreams  
I won't be far away  
One more kiss then I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
  
I can't believe just how fast you're growing  
I'm gonna cry when you're old enough  
To go and be on your own  
But until that very moment  
Everything's gonna be all right  
You'll still be here when I wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Everything's gonna be all right

Why ask Why  
Show yourself some mercy  
Don't be shy  
You don't have to look away  
It's alright  
You don't have to know the answers  
In your heart you know you'll do  
The Very best you can  
  
Sail away tonight, on the ocean of forgiveness  
We cannot decide which way the wind will blow  
Baby close your eyes, let go of tomorrow  
Some things in life, only heaven knows.  
  
Face the sky, like I never heard you  
Live your life you don't have to be afraid  
Here inside are those who truly love you  
there's nothing you can ever do  
To make them turn away  
  
Sail away tonight...  
Us now baby  
Oohh now and don't you cry  
Say a little prayer to heaven  
And I will sing a lullaby  
  
Sail Away tonight...

One more sad tomorrow  
And I'm not very good at hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a long hard road without you  
And there's one thing you should know  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
I really don't want you to go, no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart  
  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why, oh no  
Only love can tear you down  
Only love knows why, oh no  
  
Only love will make you cry

Every time I have it made  
I let it rain on my parade  
I need a star that doesn't fade  
When I open my eyes  
Everything is clear to see  
You've given me a destiny  
I know there's something left for me  
And I found it this time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want it all, I just want a little bit  
And I'll never stop 'til I get to it  
  
Being with a woman like you  
Is all I ever wanted to do  
Give me something I can hold on to  
Then I'll have it all  
  
Find a little place in the sun  
Won't you tell me I'm the chosen one  
Say you need me when the day is done  
Then I'll have enough  
To get me through my life  
  
Chorus  
  
I never will reget it  
'Cause I'm having the time of my life  
I can fly on the wings of our love here in the night  
Oh, it hurts if I let it  
But it's something I'd rather forget  
Now the past isn't holding me down  
Oh, don't you know  
I've learned to let it go

Little White House in a little old town  
Stuck in the middle of nowhere  
Stars shine bright when the sun goes down  
It's a perfect world as long as you're there  
  
[Chorus]  
Count my blessings and save my prayers  
Love waking up in the morning  
Sunlight shining upon your hair  
And you're lying next to me  
  
Blue sky over fields of green  
I'm as happy as I've ever been  
One thing makes it all so clear  
It's a perfect world as long as you're there  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
And it's where I want to be  
  
Don't want to live near the lights of the city  
I like it right where I am  
Just to be part of a woman in love  
With the heart of a simple man  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
And it's where I want to be.  
  
Ohoo... When you're next to me  
I'm exactly where I want to be [Repeat: x 5]

She lays her cards out on the table  
She always gets what she's going for, and a whole lot more  
Got the movers and the shakers  
Quaking inside their mohair shoes  
After all there's nothing to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
Cracking that whip  
Making her own decisions  
Taking no lip  
Living with no conditions  
  
There's only one thing that she's missing  
She never tells anybody, she's missing it more and more each night  
And though she cries when she's alone  
By the morning she's ready to go  
She's got the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything's fine  
Just as long as they do it her way  
Living with style  
She's got it all  
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball  
  
And though she cries when she's alone  
By the morning she's ready to go  
She's got the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything's fine  
Just as long as they do it her way  
Living with style  
She's got it all  
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball

Rain, rain love, rain, rain love  
Rain, rain love, rain, rain love  
Threw out my old raincoat, set sail without a boat  
For places somewhere far beyond my dreams  
As the sky came pouring down, I lay down on the ground  
Like I was dreaming, I let the feeling wash all over me  
Rain love covered around me  
Rain, rain love finally found me  
This time you're gonna recognize  
One drop will open up your eyes, rain love  
It's the color of every sky, it's the way to change the tide  
When the world is crumbling down on you and me  
It's the calm that lifts the storm, it's the promise that keeps you warm  
When you don't understand, just touch the guiding hand that comforts me  
Rain love  
Takes this lot to make you realize  
No greater love could ever fill the sky  
Rain love  

I don't want to lose you  
I don't want you walking away  
We're so good together  
Tell me it's forever, 'cause I want you to stay  
I'll be damned if I'm living without you  
And as long as I live, you will know  
I just want to build my world around you  
Don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion baby  
Right from the start  
Cause the hardest part  
Is being alone  
With my restless heart  
  
Tell me where you want me  
Anytime I don't care  
Tell me when you need me  
Cause baby when you need me, I will be right there  
  
I don't want to build a wall around you  
Don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion baby  
Right from the start  
Cause the hardest part  
Is being alone  
With my restless heart  
  
I'll be damned if I'm living without you  
And as long as I live, you will know  
I just want to build my world around you  
I don't want you to go  
  
Don't leave me here with my restless heart  
The one you filled with emotion right from the start  
Cause the hardest part is being alone  
With my restless heart

There's a garden of hope  
In a town called faith  
And the state of Happiness  
Is not far away  
From the country of wants and the sea of needs  
I'll take you there with me  
Someday when I rule the world  
Gonna stand by you  
Love you all I can  
You're beautiful  
The reason I believe  
Don't give up on me  
I'll make it wonderful  
When I rule the world  
When I look into your eyes  
Oohh it just amazes me  
And the way I feel inside  
When your changing me  
Through the sweat and the tears  
Moving step by step  
I'll do anything for you  
Someday when I...  
High, High above it all  
In the sky you promised I choose to stand  
Stand by you I'll stand by you  
Someday when I....  
the reason I believe  
Oh don't give up on me  
I'll make it wonderful when I rule te World  
  
  

You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice,  
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
Chorus:  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake.  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better be good tonight  
  
You better tin horns  
And lettle toy drums  
A rooty-toot-toot  
And a tum-tum-tum  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Chorus:  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake.  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better be good tonight  
  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town

Man all alone, caught in raging water  
Man overboard, caught in a terrible storm  
Throw me the rope, pull me out of trouble  
I need someone, someone to keep me warm  
Why don't you save me  
I'm burning with desire  
Why won't you save me  
Don't leave me all alone  
And it's all right  
Wrap me up, baby won't you take me home  
  
Forty below, high up a lonely mountain  
Slipping down, baby I'm sinking fast  
Throw me the rope, pull me out of this trouble  
S. O. S. Don't think I'm gonna last  
  
Why don't you save me  
I'm burning with desire  
Why won't you save me  
Come on hold me tight  
And it's all right  
Don't you know we're gonna have fun tonight

I never thought life would be easy  
Take it from me it's not easy  
When you're living on your own  
And now I face it (and even now I take it)  
One day at a time (one step at a time)  
  
Then I try to rise  
Each time I fall  
Try to find a way  
Of getting through it all  
  
I used to believe in you  
Now I need someone else to turn to  
Any though it's only a matter of time  
  
That when you lose the magic  
Suddenly your world comes falling down  
All around you  
And though it seems so tragic  
Even when there's no one else around  
You hear the sound  
Of another world falling down  
  
Leaving your memories behind me  
Hoping that nothing reminds me  
Praying that I can forget  
And even now I take it  
One step at a time, and now I  
  
Face the future eye to eye  
I know it won't be easy, but I'll get by

Something beautiful  
Happens this time of the year  
Unbelievable  
Knowing that Christmas will soon be here  
  
Making an angel on new fallen snow  
Take an icicle souvenir  
It's so beautiful  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Something magical  
Happens this time every night  
So incredible, candles and ribbons  
And so many colored lights  
  
Gather the family and sit by the fire  
Sing when the gang's all here  
It's so magical  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Little children find it hard to sleep at right  
Waiting for old Santa and his reindeer  
A time to see each other in a different light  
There are so many reasons  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Little children find it hard to sleep at night  
Waiting for old Santa till the morning light  
It's a time to see each other in a different way  
It's a wonderful time of the year  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Gotta love Christmas  
Gotta love Christmas  
Gotta love Christmas

You say not now, it's too late  
Now's not the time, it can wait  
You never listen to me  
Some things are hard to forget  
It's time to do something you might regret  
You never listen to me  
  
I think that you must be blind  
Havn't you noticed that I'm not around  
Waisting your precious time  
  
All that I want  
Is knowing that someone will notice me  
I can't go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me  
  
Losing the will to survive  
You never act like you know I'm alive  
You never listen to me  
  
All that I need  
Is knowing that someone remembers me  
I can't go on  
Knowing that you never bother to listen to me

You know our love was meant to be  
The kind of love that lasts forever  
And I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know, everywhere I go  
You're always on my mind, in my heart  
In my soul  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see  
We're so in love when we're together  
And I know that I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know, everywhere I go  
Always on my mind, in my heart  
In my soul  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you
