The people will notice  
That the times are changing  
It's just time for now  
But not time for good it's my feelings  
That I think you're training  
Take them now  
If you think you should  
  
You want something for nothing  
The higher that you climb  
The longer you fall  
Maybe your time is coming  
Will you ask to climb  
When you find the wall  
Is it time to doubt?  
Is it time to wait?  
Will you be left alone  
At the starting gate  
I'm not blind  
And I do mind  
Coz I've had time  
now I'm alive  
  
The people have noticed  
That the times are changing  
But are they gonna  
Be something now I think I've seen you  
All hesitating I think I'll go  
And be something now  
  
You want something for nothing  
The higher that you climb  
The longer you fall  
Maybe your time is coming  
Will you ask to climb  
When you find the wall  
Is it time to doubt?  
Is it time to wait?  
Will you be left alone  
At the starting gate  
I'm not blind  
And I do mind  
Coz I've had time  
Now I'm alive  
  
Yeah I'm alive  
Now I'm alive  
Yeah I'm alive

It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me  
To go through all the things that I want to be  
I don't believe in everything I see  
You know I'm blind so why'd you disagree  
  
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay  
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day  
These are crazy days but they make me shine  
Time keeps rolling by  
  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay  
  
Whatcha gonna do when the walls come falling down  
You never move, you never make a sound  
Where you gonna swim with the riches that you found  
You're lost at sea, well, I hope that you drown  
  
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay  
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day  
These are crazy days but they make me shine  
Time keeps rolling by  
  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day  
And all around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay

Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day

Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay

Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day  
And all around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay

Please don't cry, never say die  
  
So please don't cry, never say die  
Please don't cry, never say die  
  
So please don't cry, never say die  
So please don't cry, never say die  
So please don't cry, never say die  
So please don't cry, never say die

[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
I'll show you what you love  
I'll give you half the world if that's enough  
  
[Verse]  
Let me take you down  
Let me hear you smile  
Let me rest my head here for a while  
In the end we'll leave it all behind  
Because the life I think I'm trying to find  
Is probably all in the mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
I'll show you what you love  
I'll give you half the world if that's enough

Won't you take me  
Won't you take me to the edge of night and make me  
Won't you make me walk into the light  
And there'll be no eyes  
No eyes that see such beauty would lose their sight  
And there'll be no lies  
No lies that you could tell me to make things right  
  
Cos I gave all my money to people and things  
And the price I'm still playing for the shit that it brings  
Doesn't fill me with hope for the songs that you sing  
Tonight, this is your life  
Angel child  
  
When you find out  
When you find out who you are you know you'll be free  
To see your own ability  
But there'll be no eyes  
No eyes that see such beauty would lose their sight  
And there'll be no lies  
No lies that you could tell me to make things right  
  
Cos I gave all my money to people and things  
And the price I'm still playing for the shit that it brings  
Doesn't fill me with hope for the songs that you sing  
Tonight, this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight, this is your life, this is your life  
Angel child of mine  
  
Tonight, this is your life, this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight, this is your life, this is your life  
Angel child of mine  
Tonight, this is your life, this is your life  
Angel child  
Tonight, this is your life, this is your life  
Angel child

Gold and silver and sunshine is rising up  
Pour yourself another cup of Lady Grey  
Take my hand in the meantime, when you've had enough  
You'll find me on the end of a runway, babe  
  
Tell the world that you love them in a melody  
Send my old piano and a telegram  
Gotta get me a doctor with a remedy  
I'm gonna take a walk with the Monkey Man!  
  
Someone tell me I'm dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in  
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high  
  
Someone tell me I'm dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shine a light on your fire when you come on in  
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high

Wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that I'm singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging  
Wrap up cold when it's warm outside  
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city in the sun  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes, get a grip on yerself inside  
  
So wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that I'm singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging  
  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes, get a grip on yerself inside  
Inside  
Yeah, a grip inside  
Yeah, a grip inside  
You betcha! You betcha!  
  
So wrap up cold when it's warm outside  
Please sit down you make me fill giddy  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city  
  
I've been kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes get a grip on yerself inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
You betcha!  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,  
C'mon, c,mon, c'mon  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(First verse)  
  
I thought love was only true in fairy tales,  
Meant for someone else but not for me,  
Love was out to get me, (Baddabudumbadum)  
That's the way it seems, (Baddabudumbadum)  
Dissapointment Haunted all my dreams,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And then I saw her face,  
Now I'm a believer,  
Not a trace,  
Of doubt in ma' mind,  
I'm in love, Oh! I'm a believer,  
I couldn't leave her if I tried,  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
I thought love was more or less a given thing,  
Seems the more you give,  
The less I got,  
Whats the use in trying, (Baddabudumbadum)  
All you get is pain, (Baddabudumbadum)  
When I needed sunshine I got rain,  
  
[Chorus:]

I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart  
I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart  
  
I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart  
I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart  
  
I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart  
I better let you know, It's time for you to go  
You're gonna break my heart

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life  
Trying to make ends meet  
You're a slave to money, then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places  
Where all the veins meet, yeah  
  
No change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
But I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
  
No, no, no  
  
Well I never pray  
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah  
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah  
I let the melody shine  
Let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now  
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now  
  
No change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
And I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I can't change, I can't change it  
  
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life  
Trying to make ends meet  
Trying to find some money, then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places  
Where all the veins meet, yeah  
  
You know I can't change, I can't change  
I can't change, I can't change  
But I'm here in my mind  
I am here in my mind  
  
And I'm a million different people  
From one day to the next  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
I can't change my mind  
No, no, no, no, no  
I can't change  
Can't change my body  
No, no, no  
  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
Been down, ever been down, ever been down  
Ever been down, ever been down  
That why

You know I need a little break  
To get away for a holiday  
So I can see the sun  
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun  
If you can get some  
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane  
Or I could steal a car  
'Cause in a car you can go far  
Just depends what kinda car you are  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
What kinda car you are  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
I met a funny looking girl  
On a crowded beach in Spain  
Her name was Avaline  
She said she came to Spain to have a good time  
But she was with her mum  
Who had a face like a nun in pain  
She said her name was Dot  
She didn't half talk a lot  
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England  
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends  
Don't ya know - I should have stayed in England  
With my big house and my big car  
And all my friends there at the bar  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
You know I need a little break  
To get away for a holiday  
So I can see the sun  
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun  
If you can get some  
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane  
Or I could steal a car  
'Cause in a car you can go far  
It just depends on what kind of car you are  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
What kind of car you are  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst 'round town  
It's no surprise to me  
That you're classless, clever and free  
  
Loaded just like a gun  
You're the hero that's still unsung  
Living on borrowed time  
You're my sun, and you're gonna shine  
  
Talking to myself again  
This time I think I'm getting through  
It's funny how you think  
It's funny how, it's funny how when you do...  
  
Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst round town  
It's no surprise to me  
That you're classless, clever and free  
  
Lonely soul  
Busy working overtime  
Nothing ever gets done  
Especially when your hands are tied  
  
Lonely soul  
Baking up your mother's pride  
Nothing ever gets done  
Not until your war's won  
  
Born on a different cloud  
You're born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
  
Na na na na na na na

What was that sound ringing around your brain?  
Today was just a blur you gotta head like a ghost train  
What was that sound ringing around your brain?  
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?  
  
You're the outcast you're the underclass  
But you don't care because you're living fast  
You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end  
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends  
  
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who  
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.  
Bring it on down. Bring it down for me  
Your head's in a fish tank  
  
Your body and your mind can't breath  
You're the outcast - you're the underclass  
But you don't care - because you're living fast  
You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end  
  
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends  
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who  
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.

If you gave me a fresh carnation  
I would only crush it's tender petals  
With me you'll have no escape  
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle  
I trample down all life in my wake  
I eat it up and take the cake  
I just avert my eyes to the pain  
Of someone's loss helping my gain  
  
If you gave me a dream for my pocket  
You'd be plugging in the wrong socket  
With me there's no room for the future  
With me there's no room with a view at all  
  
I am out of season all year around  
Hear machinery roar to my empty sound  
Touch my heart and feel winter  
Hold my hand and be doomed forever  
  
If you gave me a fresh carnation  
I would only crush it's tender petals  
With me you'll have no escape  
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle  
And if you're wondering by now who I am  
Look no further than the mirror  
Cause I am the greed and fear  
And every ounce of hate in you

I heard a whisper on my radio  
But I paid no mind  
I just sat back and let it go  
To catch the rain from a lonely waterfall  
But I might beware  
'Cause they could drown me like a doll  
  
They got me running in and out of time  
I feel like a Bona Fide  
Keeper of the right and wrong  
And I've known all along but let me just make it clear  
  
Everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
  
I slip my skin as the prophets reappear  
But I paid no mind  
I'm just trying to persevere  
With the sins I have to shake from me within  
Though I might beware  
'Cause they're just trying to wear me thin  
  
They got me running in and out of time  
I feel like a Bona Fide  
Keeper of the right and wrong  
And I've known all along but let me just make it clear  
  
Everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
  
Everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
Carry us all

Is it my imagination  
Or have I finally found something worth living for?  
I was looking for some action  
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cos when it comes on top. ..  
  
You gotta make it happen!  
  
Is it worth the aggravation  
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?  
It's a crazy situation  
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol!  
  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cos when it comes on top. ..  
  
You gotta make it happen!

What a life it would be  
If you would come to mine for tea  
I'll pick you up at half past three  
And we'll have lasagna  
  
I'll treat you like a Queen  
I'll give you strawberries and cream  
And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna  
  
These could be the best days of our lives  
But I don't think we've been living very wise  
Oh no! no!  
What a life it would be

And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna

Step off a train, all alone at dawn  
Back into the hole where I was born  
Sun in the sky, never raised an eye to me  
  
There's blood on the tracks, and they must be mine  
Fool on the hill, and I feel fine  
Don't look back, 'cause you know what you might see  
  
Look into the wall of my mind's eye  
I think I know, but I don't know why  
Questions of the answers you might need  
  
Comin' in a mess, going out in style  
I ain't good lookin', but I'm someone's child  
No one can give me the air that's mine to breathe  
  
I met my maker, I made him cry  
And on my shoulder, he asked me why  
His people won't fly through the storm  
I said listen up man, they don't even know you're born  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
I don't really care for what you believe  
So open up your fist and you will receive  
The thoughts and the words of every man you'll meet  
  
Get up off the floor of the leaving line  
No one's ever gonna ever ask you twice  
Get all the fuss and bring it all home to me  
  
I met my maker, I made him cry  
And on my shoulder, he asked me why  
His people won't fly through the storm  
I said listen up now, they don't even know you're born  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)  
  
All my people right here, right now  
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)

A Cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say  
About the things caught in my mind  
As the day was dawning my plane flew away  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
And I want to be there when you're...  
Coming down  
  
And I want to be there when you hit the ground  
So don't go away say what you say  
But say that you'll stay  
Forever and a day...in the time of my life  
  
'Cause I need more time yes I need more time  
Just to make things right  
Damn my situation and the games I have to play  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
Damn my education I can't find the words to say  
About all the things caught in my mind  
Me and you what's going on?  
All we seem to know is how to show  
  
The feelings that are wrong

Slip inside the eye of your mind  
Don't you know you might find  
A better place to play  
You said that you'd never been  
But all the things that you've seen  
Will slowly fade away  
  
So I start a revolution from my bed  
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head.  
Step outside, summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
And so Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say  
  
Take me to the place where you go  
Where nobody knows if it's night or day  
But please don't put your life in the hands  
Of a Rock n Roll band  
Who'll throw it all away  
  
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed  
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside 'cos summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
'Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by  
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say  
  
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say  
  
So Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
Don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
At least not today

I haven't seen your face round  
Since I was Kid  
Your bringing back those memories  
Of the thing that we did  
You're hanging round and climbing trees  
Pretending to fly  
D'yer want to be a spaceman and live in the sky  
You got how many bills to pay  
And how many kids  
And you forgot  
About the things that we did  
The town where we're living  
Has made you a man  
And all of your dreams  
Are washed in the sand  
Well it's alright  
It's alright  
Who are you and me to say  
What's wrong and what's right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town.  
It's funny how your dreams  
Change as you're growing old  
You don't want to be no spaceman  
You just want gold  
Allthe dream stealers  
Are lying in wait  
But if you want to be a spaceman  
It's still not too late  
Well it's alright  
It's alright  
Who are you and me to say  
What's wrong and what's right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town.  
It's funny how your dreams  
Change as you're growing old  
You don't want to be no spaceman  
You just want gold Dream stealers  
Are lying in wait  
But if you want to be a spaceman  
It's still not too late  
Well it's alright  
It's alright  
Who are you and me to say  
What's wrong and what's right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town

Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain!  
  
I'm tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin' on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways!  
  
I'm tired of running hunchback  
I've been tripping now for days  
And there is no way  
You don't say!  
  
I got my drip drab velcro moustache  
Keeps them all at bay  
Get yours some day  
Oh yeah!  
  
'Cause we don't love our paycheck  
Battle up your date  
Don't get no love  
No love!  
  
Double takes for feeling  
And empty realities  
'Cause can't get no love  
Get no love!  
  
Come on like eyeball tickler  
Get up of your knees  
And smile above  
Above!  
  
Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain!  
  
I'm tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin' on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways!  
  
Desire all you want  
But you got what you need  
Not too much  
Too much!

When I was young  
I thought I had my own key  
I knew exactly  
What I wanted to be  
Now I'm sure  
You've boarded up every door  
  
Lived in a bubble  
Days were never ending  
Was not concerned  
About what life was sending  
Fantasy was real  
Now I know much about the way I feel  
  
I'll paint you the picture  
'Cause I don't think  
You live round here no more  
I've never even seen  
The key to the door  
We only get what we will settle for  
  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
  
Now my life has turned  
Another corner  
I think it's only best  
That I should warn you  
Dream it while you can  
Maybe someday I'll make you understand  
  
I'll paint you the picture  
'Cause I don't think  
You live round here no more  
I've never even seen  
The key to the door  
We only get what we will settle for  
  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
Fade away away away

Get on the rollercoaster  
The fair's in town today  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
So get on the helter skelter  
Bowl into the fray  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
You fade in-out  
You fade in-out  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow we'll be castaway  
Coming in-out of nowhere  
Singin' rhapsody  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to want to be  
Sitting upside a high chair  
The devil's refugee  
  
Is gonna be blinded by the light  
That follows me  
She fade in-out  
She fade in-out  
  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow she'll be castaway  
  
We fade in-out  
We fade in-out  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow we'll be castaway  
Get on the rollercoaster  
The fair's in town today  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
Get on the helter skelter  
Step into the fray  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
You're fading out  
You're fading out

The summer sun  
It blows my mind  
It's falling down on all that I've ever known  
Time to kiss the world goodbye  
Falling down on all that I've ever known  
Is all that I've ever known  
  
A dying scream  
It makes no sound  
Calling out to all that I've ever known  
Here am I, lost and found  
Calling out to all  
  
We live a dying dream  
If you know what I mean  
All that I've ever known  
It's all that I've ever known  
  
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly  
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide  
I tried to talk with God to no avail  
Calling my name and out of nowhere  
I said "If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"  
  
(All that I've ever known)  
(It's all that I've ever known)

Hate the way that you've taken back  
Everything you've given to me  
And the way that you'd always say  
It's nothing to do with me  
Different versions of many men  
Come before you came  
All their questions was similar  
The answers just the same  
  
I'm gonna get me a motor car  
Maybe a Jaguar maybe a plane or a day of fame  
I'm gonna be a millionaire so can you take me there  
want to be wild 'cause my life's so tame  
Here am I, going nowhere on a train  
Here am I, growing older in the rain  
Hey hey hey hey

Here am I, growing older in the rain  
Here am I, going nowhere on a train  
Here am I, getting lost and lonely sad and only  
Why sometimes does my life feel so tame ?  
Hey hey hey hey

I could be your lover, you could be all mine.  
We'd go on for ever, 'til the end of time.  
You could be my best friend, stay up all night long.  
You could be my railroad, we'd go on and on.  
  
Let's get along, there's nothing here to do.  
Let's go find a rainbow.  
I could be wrong - what am I to do?  
Guess God thinks I'm Abel.  
  
You could be my enemy, I guess there's still time.  
I get round to loving you, is that such a crime?  
  
Let's get along, there's nothing here to do.  
Let's go find a rainbow.  
I could be wrong, but what am I to do?  
Guess God thinks I'm Abel.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
Come on oh, let's make it tonight.

I would like to leave this city  
This old town don't smell too pretty and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylum  
'Cause I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say?  
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away, half the world away  
  
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down  
  
And when I leave this planet  
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And if I could leave this spirit  
I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say ?  
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away, half the world away  
Half the world away  
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down  
  
No I don't feel down  
No I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
Don't feel down  
I don't feel down

I know a girl who's lost and lonely  
Sits by the phone on her own  
But the phone don't ring  
And the birds don't sing in her tree  
She lost herself in a haze of pity  
And doesn't know where to run  
She's a headshrinker now  
And I think it's time we have some fun  
  
Lost in a fog  
I've been treated like a dog  
And I'm out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown  
Whatever's going down  
Is coming around  
I hope you don't regret today  
  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
  
Lost in a fog  
I've been treated like a dog  
And I'm out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown

Help, I need somebody,  
Help, not just anybody,  
Help, you know I need someone, help.  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today,  
I never needed anybody's help in any way.  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,  
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being round.  
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me.  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.  
But every now and then I feel so insecure,  
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being round.  
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me.

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride  
Get to the bottom and I see you again  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do you, don't you want me to love you ?  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Do you, don't you want me to make you ?  
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Look out  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of my slide  
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride  
Get to the bottom and I see you again  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do you, don't you want me to love you ?  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
You're coming down fast  
Yeah you're coming down fast  
You're coming down fast  
You're coming down fast  
You're coming down fast  
  
Yeah yeah yeah

Hey hey, my my  
Rock and roll will never die  
Here's more to the picture than meets the eye  
Hey hey, my my  
  
You're out of the blue and into the black  
They give you this but you pay for for that  
  
And when you die, no you don't come back  
Cos your out of the blue and into the black  
  
My my, hey hey  
Rock and roll is here to stay  
  
It's better to burn out than to fade away  
My my, hey hey

I hitched a ride with my soul  
By the side of the road  
Just as the sky turned black  
I took a walk with my fame  
Down memory lane  
I never did find my way back  
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away  
And what will it hold for me  
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you  
You're standing ignoring me  
I thought that I heard someone say now  
There's no time for running away now  
Hey now! Hey now!  
Feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain  
Feel no shame  
The first thing I saw  
As I walked through the door  
Was a sign on the wall that read  
It said you might never know  
That I want you to know  
What is written inside of your head  
And time as it stands  
Won't be held in my hands  
Or living inside of my skin  
And as it fell from the sky  
I asked myself why  
Can I never let anyone in ?  
I thought that I heard someone say now  
There's no time for running away now  
Hey now! Hey now!  
Feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain  
Feel no shame  
I hitched a ride with my soul  
By the side of the road  
Just as the sky turned black  
I took a walk with my fame  
Down memory lane  
I never did find my way back  
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away  
And what will it hold for me  
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you  
You're standing ignoring me  
I thought that I heard someone say now  
There's no time for running away now  
Hey now! Hey now!  
Feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain  
Feel no shame

I can take 'em all.  
So I leave you with this thought.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I got to walk this way.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I-I-I will catch you when you fall  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
And I-I-I-I will catch you if you call  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
  
I can see for miles  
And I can see you when your cries.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I gotta walk this way.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
And I-I-I will catch you when you fall  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
And I-I-I-I will catch you if you call  
That is what I'm gonna do.

Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is  
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed  
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain  
He thought he was king creole  
Until he found out, until he found out  
  
He sits upon a throne  
He lives a sleazy lie  
But he's all alone again, again  
  
I can see a liar, sitting by the fire  
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought  
Coming as he goes into overdose  
I wonder what he thinks of me?

Help me, defy the light the shining on me  
To get back what they've taken from me  
With a little fire where it's cold  
  
Show me, the path that leads to all the glory  
The words that tell a sacred story  
With a little fire where it's cold  
  
I wanna live in a dream in my record machine  
I wanna picture the world and everyone inside my mouth  
Cos all the money I waste, is it a matter of taste?  
I wanna picture the world and you can't make me spit it out  
  
Take me, back from the darkness where they  
Sent me, give hope to places to where they can't be  
With a little fire where it's cold  
  
I wanna live in a dream in my record machine  
I wanna picture the world n everyone inside my mouth  
Cos all the money I waste, is it a matter of taste?  
I wanna picture the world and you can't make me spit it out  
  
You can't give me a reason I want me want to shine  
You can't give me the feelings cos they're already mine  
You get one in a million and if the sun won't rise  
On my soul, then I'll go

I'm locked up in chainsfor the rest of my lifethere's no one else to blame but
methe start of the day'sjust the end of the nighti'm feeling like I'm lost at
seasometimes is just seems so simplei'm feeling like I'm down on my
kneessometimes like a man in the middlei don't know my own mindwon't you let
me be  
Coz I can find youliving in my worlddragging me roundjust like a dog on a
leadbut when I find myown peace of mind ii will believe  
I'm locked up in chainsfor the rest of my lifethere's no one else to blame but
me  
Coz I can find youliving in my worlddragging me roundjust like a dog on a
leadbut when I findmy own peace of mind ii will believe  
I will believe

There's nothing you can say  
I know exactly where I'm going  
You said there was no way  
That I could go with out you knowing  
There's nothing you can say  
I know exactly where I'm going  
You said there was no way  
That I could go with out you knowing  
That I could go with out you knowing  
That I could go with out you knowing  
  
Just you wait and see  
I will get what I have come for  
So don't try telling me  
I couldn't give  
Just you wait and see  
I will get what I have come for  
So don't try to tell me  
'Cause I will show you all the way  
  
There's nothing you can say  
I know exactly where I'm going  
You said there was no way  
That I could go with out you knowing  
  
Just you wait and see  
I will get what I have come for  
So don't try telling me  
I couldn't given you a lot more  
Just you wait and see  
I will get what I have come for  
So don't try to tell me  
'Cause I will show you all the way

My heart it skips a beat when I behold  
The light that's shining through your eyes of gold  
From heavenly blood you seem to spring  
From heavenly waters you can drink  
  
I'll meet you on a day that never ends  
I'll greet you in a way that heaven meant  
You lay me down gently on the leaves  
You cover me over in my sleep  
  
I never did say that I wish I could  
I never could pray 'cause it's just no good  
I hope you don't break my heart of stone  
I don't want to scream out loud  
  
And wake up on my own  
And as I close my eyes  
And the sky turns red  
I realize just what you are  
  
You're an idler's dream  
And you're singing Shangri-La  
  
Shangri-La  
Shangri-La  
Shangri-La

It must have been love  
  
  
Lay a whisper on my pillow  
Leave the winter on the ground  
I wake up lonely  
There's air of silence  
In the bedroom and all around  
Touch me now  
I close my eyes and dream away  
  
It must have been love but it's over now  
It must have been good but I lost it somehow  
It must have been love but it's over now  
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out  
  
Make-believing we're together  
That I'm sheltered by your heart  
But in and outside  
I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm  
And it's a hard winter's day  
I dream away  
  
It must have been love but it's over now  
It was all that I wanted  
Now I'm living without  
It must have been love but it's over now  
It's where the water flows  
It's where the wind blows

It's better people, love one another  
'Cause livin' your life can be tough  
It's better people, speak to each other  
Your shame is not enough  
  
If everybody came alive  
And stayed alive  
And lived their lives instead, yeah  
So come outside  
And feel the light  
It's cold inside  
But it's lonely in your bed, in your bed  
  
And you though we might be  
But what you heard before  
Was only sleepin' in your brain  
But if you came with me  
The days'd never end  
Would never be the same  
They'd never be the same  
They'd never be the same  
Never be the same  
  
It's better people, love one another  
'Cause livin' your life can be tough  
It's better people, speak to each other  
Your shame is not enough  
  
If everybody came alive  
And stayed alive  
And lived their lives instead, yeah  
So come outside  
And feel the light  
It's cold inside  
And it's lonely in your bed, in your bed  
  
And you though we might be  
But what you heard before  
Is sleepin' in your brain  
But if you came with me  
The days'd never end  
Would never be the same  
They'd never be the same  
This is goin by a different name  
They'd never be the same

Say something shout it from the rooftops off your head  
Make it sort of mean something make me understand  
Or I'll forget  
The people here on lifes beaches  
They wish upon the waves that hide the sand  
Let them know that life theaches you  
To build a castle in your hand  
Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it won't be long  
It's getting better man!  
  
Hey! what was that you said to me?  
Just say the word and I'd be free?  
And when the stars are shining bright  
We're getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And we're the fire in the sky  
We're getting better man!  
  
Build something, build a better place and call it home  
Even if it means nothing you'll never ever feel that your alone  
  
Cos maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it won't be long  
It's getting better man!  
  
Hey! what was that you said to me?  
Just say the word and I'd be free?  
Yeah as the fire in the sky  
It's getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are shining bright  
It's getting better man!  
  
It's getting better man!  
  
And what was that you said to me?  
You told me one day I'd be free  
And when the fire's burning bright  
I'm getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are in the sky  
We're getting better man  
  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,

Head like a rock spinning round and round  
I found it in a hole sitting upside down  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky  
You demand the answers but don't know why  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
  
So what would you say if I said to you  
It's not in what you say it's in what you do  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Bring it on home to where we found  
Head is like a rock sitting upside down  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
Yeah it's good yes it's good it's good to be free

It's nine o'clock  
I'm getting tired  
I'm sick of all my records  
And the clothes I bought today  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older ?  
  
I'm staying in  
I can't be bothered  
Making conversation with the friends  
That I don't know  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older ?  
  
And I bet that this is how life  
Turns out when you're finally grown  
And you know if this is my life  
I'll sit around all day and I'll moan  
  
I'm half way up to the bottom  
Of another bottle of my next best favourite friend  
  
I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older  
  
No I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older  
  
No I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older

I drove my Sarsen through your garden last night  
I kicked your front door down around at midnight  
Something's telling me, boy, that your avoiding me  
And when I find you, you will run for your tea.  
  
Chorus:  
I've got a brand new shiny helmet, and a pair of kinky boots.  
I've got a lovely new flak jacket, a lovely khaki suit.  
When we go on night patrol, we hold each other's hand,  
For we are the British Army, and we're here to take your land.  
  
My good friend Bertie, he's in the udr.  
To search for weapons he will go near and far.  
Up around by Kappa, you'd never find him there.  
The only gun he'll get there is an Armalite in his ear!  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Trevor, he's in the ruc.  
But now they've handed him his redundancy.  
Folks along the border won't be seeing him any more,  
That provo sniper will be missing him for sure!  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Nigel, he's in the sas.  
He says a child is just as good as the rest.  
Now they've gone and posted him way down to Crossmaglen,  
He wished to blazes, he was back in jail again!  
  
Chorus  
  
My good friend Sammy, he's in the dup.  
An upstanding member, as all the world can see.  
I said, "Go up to Donegal, if you want to have some fun."  
He said, "I'll take a run there, if I have nothing on."  
  
Chorus

And how does it feel like to wake up in ther sun?  
And how does it feel like to shine on everyone?  
How does it feel like to let forever be?  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?  
How does it feel like to sail in on the breeze?  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?  
  
How does it feel like to make it happening?  
And how does it feel like to be with everything?  
And how does it feel like to let forever be?  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?  
  
How does it feel like to be in christamine?  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?  
Scream my symphony  
(screen my sin for me)?

Who kicked a hole in the sky  
So the heavens would cry over me?  
Who stole the soul from the sun  
In a world come undone at the seams?  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love...  
  
I hope the weather is calm  
As you sail up your heavenly stream  
Suspended clear in the sky  
Are the words that we sing in our dreams  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love... [Repeat: x 2]  
  
(Noel)  
  
Come on baby blue  
Shake up your tired eyes  
The world is waiting for you  
May all your dreaming  
Fill the empty sky  
  
But if it makes you happy  
Keep on clapping  
Just remember I'll be by your side  
And if you don't let go  
It's gonna pass you by...  
  
Who kicked a hole in the sky  
So the heavens would cry over me?  
Who stole the soul from the sun  
In a world come undone at the seams?  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love... [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Let there be love

Is anyone here prepared to say  
Just what they mean or is it too late ?  
For anyone here to try to do  
Just what it takes to get through to you  
  
So let's all make believe  
That we're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we're gonna need each other  
  
Stradle my hope and make me pray  
To a God I've never seen, but who I've betrayed  
To the people who live the afterlife  
In a place I'll never be 'til I'm crucified  
  
So let's all make believe  
We're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we'll need each other  
  
Let's all make believe  
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother  
Let's all make believe  
That in the end we'll all grow up  
  
So let's all make believe  
That we're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we'll need each other  
  
Let's all make believe  
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother  
Let's all make believe  
That in the end we'll all grow up

Listen up  
What's the time said today  
I'm gonna speak my mind  
Take me up to the top of the world  
I want to see my crime  
  
Day by day  
There's a man in a suit  
Who's gonna make you pay  
For the thoughts that you think  
And the words they won't let you say  
  
One fine day  
Gonna leave you all behind  
It wouldn't be so bad  
If I had more time  
  
Sailing down a river alone  
I've been tryin' to find my way back home  
But I don't believe in magic  
Life is automatic  
But I don't mind being on my own  
No I don't mind being on my own

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb, blowing my mind.

Calling all the stars to fall  
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands  
Call for me to set me free  
Lift me up and take me where I stand  
  
She believes in everything  
And everyone and you and yours and mine  
I waited for a thousand years  
For you to come and blow me off my mind  
  
Hey Lyla  
The stars about to fall  
So what you say Lyla  
The world around us makes me feel so  
Small Lyla  
If you can't hear me call  
Then I can't say Lyla  
Heaven help you catch me if I fall  
  
She's the queen of all I've seen  
And every song and city far and near  
Heaven help my mademoiselle  
She rings the bell for all the world to hear

An extra ordinary guy  
  
Can never have an ordinary day  
  
He might live the long goodbye  
  
But that is not for me to say  
  
I dig his friends I dig his shoes  
  
He is just a child with nothing to lose  
  
In their minds their minds  
  
But I'll have my way  
  
In my own time  
  
I'll have my say  
  
My star will shine  
  
'cause you see me I got my Magic Pie.  
  
Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by  
  
I've been and now I've gone  
  
There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years,  
  
Many minds to educate the people who have disappeared  
  
D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?  
  
I am like a child with nothing to lose  
  
My mind

Chorus:  
Manuk dadali, manuk panggagahna  
Perlambang sakti indonesia jaya  
Manuk dadali, pangkakoncarana  
Resep ngahiji rukun sakabehna

Silih pikanyaah teu inggis belapati  
Manuk dadali ngandung siloka sinatria  
Keur sakumna bangsa di nagara indonesia

Merry Christmas (Slade Cover)

everybodies having fun

and shes up and rock 'n' rolling with rest

(repeat chorus X4)

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,  
Jesus loves you more than you will know.  
God bless you, please Mrs. Robinson.  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
We'd like to know a little bit about your for our files  
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.  
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes,  
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.  
  
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,  
Jesus loves you more than you will know.  
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson.  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Hide in the hiding place where no one ever goes.  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes.  
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair.  
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids.  
  
Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson,  
Jesus loves you more than you will know.  
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson.  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon.  
Going to the candidate's debate.  
Laugh about it, shout about it  
When you've got to choose  
Every way you look at this you lose.  
  
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio,  
Our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you.  
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson.  
Jotting Joe has left and gone away,  
Hey hey hey.

I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meanings of life.  
But what you think that you heard slipped away out the back of your mind.  
You'll get your mucky fingers burned.  
You get your truth from the lies you were learned.  
And all your plastic believers will leave us and they won't return.  
  
And when you look in that mirror  
And you're tying up your buttons and bows.  
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the Emporer's Clothes.  
You found your god in a paper bag, you get your history from the Union Jack.  
And all your brothers and sisters are gone and they won't come back.  
  
I'm fed up with life in the City,  
All the phoneys have blown my mind.  
When I'm gone, you look like you'd miss me,  
So come along with me - but don't ask why,  
'Cause it's all mine,  
It's all mine.  
It's all mine.  
It's all mine.  
  
[Harmonica Solo]  
  
'Cause it's all mine  
It's all mine  
It's all mine  
It's all mine  
  
[Harmonica Solo 2]

Everybody knows...but no one's saying nothing  
  
And it's a sound so very loud...that no one can hear?  
  
I got something in my shoes...It's keeping me from walking  
  
Down the long and winding road...back home to you  
  
And round this town you've ceased to be  
  
That's what you got for sleeping with the enemy  
  
Where angels fly you won't play  
  
So guess who's gonna take the blame for...  
  
My Big Mouth my big name  
  
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
Into my big mouth, you can fly a plane  
  
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
I ain't never spoke to God  
  
And I ain't never been to heaven  
  
But you assumed I knew the way  
  
Even though the map was given  
  
And as you look into the eyes  
  
Of a bloody cold assassin  
  
Only then you realise  
  
With who's life you have been messin'

People try to put us down  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
Just because we get around  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
Things they do look awful cold  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
I hope I die before get old  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
  
This is my generation  
This is my generation, baby  
  
Why don't you all fade away  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
And don't try to dig what we all say  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
  
This is my generation  
This is my generation, baby  
  
Why don't you all fade away  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
And don't try to dig what we all say

Yeah, I hope I die before get old

Talkin' 'bout my generation  
Talkin' 'bout my generation

A feeling sleeping deep inside  
You hide it so I'll never find  
Today I think I'll waste my time  
You never notice, you are blind  
The dream I have can never be  
To photograph what the eye can't see  
I fight to live another day  
I live to find out, come what may  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, Your my lover  
Your my lover, Your my lover  
  
She gives me light when the sun goes down  
She gives me strength when I don't drown  
She gives me hope and destiny  
She gives me air that I can breathe  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
  
Faith in the lord is something I can never have  
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free  
Faith in the lord is something I will never have  
'Cause the lord I know don't got not faith in me  
  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother  
Your my lover, I'm your brother

I want to get high, but I never could take the pain  
'Cause it would blow away my soul like a hurricane  
Like a one man band clapping in the pouring rain  
If I know where I'm going, I don't know from where I came  
  
Where we gonna be in summertime?  
And are we gonna see the heavens shine  
Like diamonds in the sky?  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road  
  
I want to get high, but I really can't take the pain  
''cause it will blow away my soul like a hurricane  
I'm like a one man band clapping in the pouring rain  
If I know where I'm going, I don't know from where I came  
  
Where we gonna be in summertime?  
And are we gonna see the heavens shine  
Like diamonds in the sky?  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone, on a one way road

So then be off, find that I've lost my way in the city.  
The streets and the thousands of colours all bleed into one.  
I fall down, Heaven won't help me.  
I call out, no-one would hear.  
All of a sudden I've lost my way out of the City.  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning is breaking it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town.  
  
Name on the faces in places - they mean nothing to me.  
It's all they can do to be part of a queue in this town.  
I fall down, Heaven won't help me.  
I call out, no-one will hear.  
"There'll be no tomorrow" they say, well I'll say "more's the pity."  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning has broken it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town.  
  
Stand tall, stand proud.  
Every beginning has broken it's promise.  
I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town.  
  
Finding my soul in this town.  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
Keep on trying...  
  
Na na na na na na na na....

Will you pass me down the wine  
It's getting near that time  
What you got tomorrow?  
Only pain and sorrow  
  
Will you dance for me tonight  
I promise I won't bite  
Let's go see the sun burst  
Wait til I go numb first  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
Will you break it down for me  
'cause what will be will be  
I can hear the thunder  
Gonna stop the hunger  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
To all my sisters yeah you're looking pretty fine  
And to all my brothers I bet you're feeling kinda high  
And to all the mothers well come on now, don't be shy  
And to all the fathers who are sick and fucking tired

Put yer money where yer mouth is  
Yer mamma says that you was real  
Put yer money where yer mouth is  
Yer mamma says that you was real  
  
Ready or not, come what may  
The bets are going down for judgement day  
So put yer money in yer mouth  
And your hands right upon the wheel  
  
Put yer money where yer mouth is  
Yer pappa says that you was real  
Put yer money where yer mouth is  
Yer pappa says that you was real  
  
Ready or not, and come what may  
You betcha going down on judgement day  
So put yer money in yer mouth  
And yer hands right upon the wheel

I live my life in the city  
There's no easy way out  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
I need some time in the sunshine  
I gotta slow it right down  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
  
I live my life for the stars that shine  
People say it's just a waste of time  
Then they say I should feed my head  
That to me was just a day in bed  
I'll take my car and drive real far  
They're not concerned about the way we are  
In my mind my dreams are real  
Now we're concerned about the way I feel  
  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
  
I live my life in the city  
There's no easy way out  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
I need some time in the sunshine  
I gotta slow it right down  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
  
I live my life for the stars that shine  
People say it's just a waste of time  
Then they say I should feed my head  
That to me was just a day in bed  
I'll take my car and drive real far  
They're not concerned about the way we are  
In my mind my dreams are real  
Now we're concerned about the way I feel  
  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
  
You're not down with who I am  
Look at you now you're all in my hands tonight  
  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll

I can give a hundred million reasons  
To build a barricade  
I blame it on the changing of the seasons  
The thoughts that I've conveyed  
  
Does it make it all right?  
It doesn't make it all right  
  
To roll it over my soul and leave me here  
Roll it over my soul and leave me here  
  
Look around at all the plastic people  
Who live without a care  
Try to sit with me around my table  
But never bring a chair  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What you're not supposed to feel  
You take what you want  
But you won't get it for free  
You need more time  
'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
But I'm not sure if it ever works out right  
But it's ok. It's all right  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What you're not supposed to feel  
When you take what you want  
You don't get hope for free  
You need more time  
'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
And I'm not sure if it'll ever, ever, ever work out right  
Will it ever, ever, ever work out right?  
'cause it never, never, never works out right

The paper boy is working before he goes  
Lying to the teacher he knows he knows  
He didn't and he should've  
Brought his lines in yesterday  
Ernie bangs the sound and the day begins  
The letterbox is open and your cash falls in  
I'll meet you at the office  
Just before the staff clock in  
  
Round are way the birds are singing  
Round are way the sun shines bright  
Round are way the birds sing for yer  
The already know yer  
  
The game is kicking off in around the park  
It's twenty five a side and before it's dark  
There's gonna be a loser  
And you know the next goal wins  
Cab it to the front as it's called a draw  
Everybody's knockin at yours once more  
Ernie bangs the sound  
And no one's spoken since half past four  
  
Round are way the birds are singing  
Round are way the sun shines bright  
Round are way the birds are minging  
Round are way it's alright  
Round are way the birds sing for you  
'cause the already know yer  
They already know yer

Sing a sad song  
In a lonely place  
Try to put a word in from me  
It's been so long  
  
Since I found this place  
You better put in two or three  
We as people are just walking 'round  
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground  
  
What we don't see  
Well it can't be real  
What we don't touch we cannot feel  
  
Where we're living in this town  
The sun is coming up and it's going down  
But it's all just the same at the end of the day  
And we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says it's wrong  
So we don't ask why  
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day  
  
We're throwing it all away  
We're throwing it all away  
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day  
  
If you're needing  
Something I can give  
I know I'd help you if I can  
If your honest and you say that you did  
  
You know that I would give you my hand  
Or a sad song  
In a lonely place  
I'll try to put a word in for you  
  
Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case  
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do  
  
Where we're living in this town  
The sun is coming up and it's going down  
But it's all just the same at the end of the day  
When we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says it's wrong  
So we don't ask why  
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day  
  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day

When you kiss the base o'my spine  
Make my body into your shrine  
You give me this feeling deep inside  
One that I can no longer disguise  
While other snakes just she'd their skins  
Forked tongues pointing out my sins  
Even though I realise that history's not on my side  
Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes  
  
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind  
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before  
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more  
  
Flying high upon the gallows  
Too messed up to step out of the shadows  
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow  
Rescued from this deep dark hollow  
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails  
Time is nigh for you leather girls  
Maybe we should end this race  
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace  
  
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind  
I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind  
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches  
Potted gold and tattooed faces  
Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops  
Diazepam dreams there catching streams  
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green  
Still I've got a flash-bulb head  
Still I've got a flash-bulb head  
  
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind  
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before  
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more  
  
Come along nice, come along dead  
Scorpio rising, and paint it red  
A psychic equalizer in your head  
Come along nice, come along dead  
Scorpio rising, and paint it red  
A psychic equalizer in your head..

Trying to press, what you might be feeling  
Why suppress, what you might be needing  
  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
You were lying in your sink  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
Cause you don't mean anything to anyone anymore  
  
Why confess, well you wouldn't need to  
Because on your desk, there's more to be seen to  
  
By the time just keep on ticking  
Until I get my sweet release  
By the time just keep on winding  
Until this cold-stop has ceased  
And everyone can see the sun  
  
I've send underwater, slept with your daughter  
She told me what your rule book read  
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter  
So won't you let me have my head  
And then I can see the sun  
  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
You were lying in your sink  
You missed the moon on Monday morning  
Because you don't mean anything to anyone, anymore  
  
By the time just keep on ticking  
Until I get my sweet release  
And down this road I'll keep on winding  
Until this cold-stop has ceased  
And everyone can see the sun  
  
Everyone can see the sun  
Everyone can see the sun  
Everyone can see the sun  
  
I've send underwater, slept with your daughter  
She told me what your rule book read  
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter  
So won't you let me have my head  
And then I can see the sun

Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya  
And your wings begin to unfold  
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing  
Are gonna keep me from the cold  
  
And if the sword is here among ya  
And its words may wound my soul  
You can fill me up with what you've got  
'cause my heart's been keeping old  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
Love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks  
  
You're in all my thoughts of passion  
And the dreams of my delight  
Whatever stirs my mortal frame  
Will you keep it warm at night  
  
I don't know where you come from  
No I haven't got a clue  
All I know is I'm in love  
With someone who loves me too  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
Love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks

Hope we've found our sweet release  
I hope I fill that hole in your soul  
Hope that at last we get some peace  
I hope the light shines on we as one  
  
There'll never be enough to learn  
The river's deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
As we wish the world away  
D'you think it's all a dream  
'cause that's what it seems  
  
Every night we hope and pray  
That we can do enough  
To keep our love  
  
Never be enough to learn  
The river's deep and the road is long  
And every which way we turn  
Always seems insane  
But it makes me feel alive  
  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
When I'm alive  
Shout it out loud  
  
Shout it out loud

I still don't know what I was waiting for  
A big love to fall down from the sky  
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor  
She put an apple in my eye  
  
[Chorus]  
I said I'm tired  
Come get me off the merry-go-round  
I'm wired  
Come feed me and then bring-a-me down  
  
She come up to me  
I can't remember what she said  
'Cause I was in a trance and I forgot it all  
Banging on about all that  
Revolution in her head  
She'd make a lover seem so magical  
  
She said I'm tired  
Come get me off the merry-go-round  
I'm wired  
Well heaven must have sent ya  
To save me from the rapture  
  
[Chorus]
