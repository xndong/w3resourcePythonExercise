Does she love me, with all her heart  
Should I worry, when we're apart  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.  
Does she need me, as she pretends  
Is this a game, well then will I win  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.

Sittin' in the mornin' sun  
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes  
Watchin' the ships roll in  
Then I watch 'em roll away again  
  
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide, roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
Left my home in Georgia  
Headed far for Frisco Bay  
I had nothin' to live for  
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way  
  
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time  
  
Looks like nothin's gonna change  
Everything, everything remains the same  
I can't do what ten people tell me to do  
So I guess I'll remain the same  
  
I'm sittin' here restin' my bones  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's Two thousand miles I roamrd  
Just to make this dock my home  
  
Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Oooo - wee, Sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time...

Out in the street  
Playin' all night long  
While the one that loved me  
Man, she was sitting at home  
Oh I didn't worry, I was a fool  
Playing the field  
And running around having fun, man  
I know everybody make a mistake sometime  
But when I got home  
My baby, she was gone  
And I found her letter lying  
Right there on the kitchen floor  
It read, "I tried to wait  
For you to come, honey  
But like a fool  
You were running around doing me wrong"  
I'm sorry, I know, baby  
Everybody make a mistake sometime  
I know I made one  
And oh, so if you are running around  
With somebody else  
Tryin' to satisfy  
Man, you can't satisfy you selfish self  
So man, you gotta take heed  
Listen to every word I'm saying  
'Cause that same thing, man  
Might happen to you one day  
And you know that everybody  
Man, I know that everybody  
Make a mistake sometime  
I know because I made mine  
I made a great big one  
Man, I made mine  
I made a great big one  
And I can't do it no more  
No, I'm never gonna do it  
I want you to come back to me, baby

For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For that's what love will do  
  
Darling, I'm so surprised,  
Oh, when I first realized  
That you were fooling me  
Darling, they say that our love won't grow  
  
I just want to tell them that they don't know  
For as long as you, long as you are loving me  
Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea  
And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world  
Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl  
  
(Wanting you) Wanting you, (I'm lonely and blue) whoa, lonely  
That's what love will do  
  
For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I, I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
That's what love will do

You've got to give a little, take a little,  
And let your poor heart break a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
  
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,  
Until the clouds roll by a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
  
As long as there's the two of us,  
We've got the world and all it's charms.  
And when the world is through with us,  
We've got each other's arms.  
  
You've got to win a little, lose a little,  
Yes, and always have the blues a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

The sun is gone away  
It is dark in the day  
No kids are laughing  
And none are playing  
  
No flowers have grown  
Since the month of May  
That's how it's been  
Since you've gone again  
  
One you left without a reason  
Two without a pleasing  
Three with a terrible pain  
Four you're gone again  
  
Picture a winter  
Without any snow  
Look up at the sky  
There's no star that glow  
  
Picture a river  
With nowhere to flow  
That's how it's been, honey  
Since you've gone again  
  
One without a reason  
Two without a pleasing  
Three with a terrible pain  
Four you're gone again  
  
I walked in the forest  
Didn't see no trees  
Go to sleep at night  
With a cold wind of breeze  
  
I ain't got no friends  
I got cold enemies  
That's how it's been  
Honey, since you've gone again  
  
Gone, gone again, gone, gone again  
Gone mama, gone again, yes, you are  
Where can I find you? I need you, darling  
  
Where can I get to you? I want you, mama baby  
I love you, darling, I need you, oh gone again  
Come back to me, baby

Cause I've got that will to try, huh

And man they we're so good to me  
All of that good, good, good old loving you give me baby

Like a snowball rolling down that side  
Of that snow covered hill, man it's growing  
Like that size of the fish that man claimed  
He broke his reel, man it's growing  
  
Like the rosebud, that's bloomin' man  
In the warning of the sun, it's growin'  
Like a tale by the time it's been told, man  
By more then one, it's growing  
  
When every day it grows a little more  
Than it was the day before  
My love for you, it grows and grows  
Hey, hey, hey, how it grows and grows  
  
But when it's going to stop  
I feel that nobody knows, man  
I said, it grows and grows, man  
A little bit stronger

Mary had a little lamb  
His bleeks was white as snow  
everywhere that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go  
  
He followed her to school one day  
And that was against the rules  
He made the children laugh and play  
You've seen that lamb  
Oh that lamb in school  
  
Oh Mary  
Listen let me tell you something  
  
Ever since I was four years old  
I hated a silly rule  
Ever since they ran Mary's lamb  
Oh all the way home from school  
  
You should have seen Mary cry  
When she waved to her lamb goodbye  
The teacher said Mary come inside  
Come on and dry, oh, dry your eyes  
  
Oh, oh, oh Mary  
Wait a minute  
  
Mary don't you be so blue  
And bring that lamb back to school  
And Mary don't you be no fool  
You see the lamb daily through  
  
When you go, oh, home today  
You and your lamb can play  
You can even do the twist  
And then it goes  
Something like this  
  
oh, oh, oh Mary  
oh, oh, oh Mary  
Come on Mary  
Don't you be such a moaner  
Don't moan no more  
Hey, hey, hey Mary, hey, hey
