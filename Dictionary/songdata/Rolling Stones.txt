Is there nothing I can say, nothing I can do to change your mind?  
I'm so in love with you, you're too deep in, you can't get out  
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you  
  
Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?  
Just like the night, they dissolve off in sleep  
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
I'll come to your emotional rescue  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You think you're one of a special breed  
You think that you're his pet Pekinese  
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true

Could be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine all mine  
You could be mine, could be mine, could be mine all mine

So stealthy, so animal quiet

Coming to your emotional rescue  
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine  
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine  
  
I will be your knight in shining armor  
Riding across the desert on a fine Arab charger

I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home.  
And I believe I've got a message for every woman and  
Every man here tonight that ever needed somebody to love  
Someone to stay with them all the time, when they're  
Up and when they're down. You know, sometimes you get what you want  
And then you go and lose what you have  
And I believe every woman and every man here tonight listen to my song  
And it save the whole world.  
Listen to me.  
  
Everybody wants somebody  
Everybody wants somebody to love

I don't care if your love grows cold  
Found love in someone else's home  
Don't like standin' in the snow  
  
Everything's turning to gold  
Everything's turning to gold  
Everything's turning to gold  
  
You used to know me long ago  
Was so lost and way down low.  
Now that the love juice starts to flow,  
Now that the love juice starts to flow,  
Everything's turning to gold  
Everything's turning to gold  
  
Everything's turning, everything's turning  
Everything's turning, everything's turning to gold  
  
I'm tired, I'm tired of doing what I'm told.  
Things are moving way too slow.  
I got no problems, I got no problems, child.  
It ain't my business, it ain't my business, ain't my style.  
Now that the love juice starts to flow,  
Now that the love juice starts to flow.

Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair  
Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere  
We get buses everywhere  
Waiting for a factory girl  
  
Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat  
Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats  
Her zipper's broken down the back  
Waiting for a factory girl  
  
Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights  
Waiting for a girl we get drunk on Friday night  
She's a sight for sore eyes  
Waiting for a factory girl  
  
Waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress  
Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet  
She ain't come out yet  
Waiting for a factory girl

Here's father, his heart screwed on  
Yes, here he's got it I'm sure  
'Cause he lost his life in an accident  
Found his heart in the man next door  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When they do transplant the brain  
Will my borrowed brain still compute the same  
Or will my daughter suffer so much more  
  
Here comes the girl, she's got her head screwed on  
But it ain't screwed on right  
Her ambition is to be a prostitute  
But the breaks just weren't right  
What exactly is gonna happen, tell me  
When her father finds out  
That his virgin daughter has bordello dreams  
And that he's the one she wants to try out  
Yeah  
  
There's ma, she's living dangerously  
It's a cinch she'll try it anything twice  
She thinks she can run right to the whirlpool's edge  
And stop herself just in time  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When she finally fizzles out  
The lovers will just be sucked into  
To see what the colours of death are all about  
  
Here's the son, has his legs a-screwed on  
Yeah, they're screwed on pretty tight  
But his brain is loose and it ain't no use  
He's already lost the fight  
What exactly is gonna happen  
When he's finally realized  
That he can't play his guitar like E.G. Jim  
Or write St. Augustine if he tried  
  
That's what happens  
When a family finds out  
That they've been in orbit now for a thousand years  
And need a thousand more to climb out

I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield  
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station  
And the preacher said, "You know you always have the Lord by your side"  
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran  
Twenty red lights in his honor  
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord  
  
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late  
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off  
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find  
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin' in the corner  
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear  
Was a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
And you can't harmonize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you're downright disgusted  
And life ain't worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send  
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus  
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California  
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio  
And all my dreams would come true  
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl  
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got, well I'll tell ya  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you're downright disgusted  
And life ain't worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes
