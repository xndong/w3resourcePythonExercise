You can be my alphabet  
And I will be your calculator  
And together we'll work out on the escalator  
  
I will time you as you run up to down  
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town  
The mean of our heights is divided by the  
Nights  
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights  
  
The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing  
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it  
  
(Chorus:)  
Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your
love.  
  
I am a dash and you are a dot, when will you see that I am all that you've
got?  
  
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago, but to you I'm just a novel that
you wish you never wrote  
  
I'm greater than x, and lesser than y  
  
So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?  
  
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard  
While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt  
  
(chorus)  
  
You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion  
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?  
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs  
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again  
  
And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one  
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one  
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one  
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia  
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia

Yeah, ay, ay  
  
He said, "Darling don't forget  
There is sweetness left on earth for you and me"  
He says, "Honey, no regrets"  
We just do our best and die,  
I just wanna cry 'cause you'll be  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever oh ooooh  
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down  
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather  
  
He says, this is just today  
It will be okay, and I, I am listening  
He says, you can trust in me  
You'll get all you'll need and how can I doubt you?  
'Cause you'll be  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever  
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down  
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather  
  
You know what you do to me  
You light up,  
Light up the dark and  
You're all the good within me  
My heart is filled, rebuilt  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever  
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down  
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever  
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down  
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever  
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down  
I'll be around, I'll be your every weather  
  
Be good to me, be good to me  
I need you now more than ever

Beautiful calm driving, deep sea pearl diving  
Constantly unwinding, beautiful calm driving  
You turned into another  
You turned into nutter  
You turned into another man  
  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger to me  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger  
To me  
  
Beautiful calm driving, emotional hiding  
Effortlessly shining, beautiful calm driving  
  
You turned into another  
You turned into nutter  
You turned into another man  
  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger to me  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger to me  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger to me  
You're a stranger to me  
You're a danger to me  
Beautiful calm driving

"Beautiful Reality"  
  
I sometimes believe that everything I dream  
Will one day be my reality  
I sometimes think that every move I make  
Will gather up and shape my reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
  
I sometimes search for signs my dreams can work  
Until I stand alert with my reality  
I sometimes look in the paradise by the book  
To give back what I took from my reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That I will one day see  
A beautiful reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That I will one day see  
A beautiful reality  
  
Beautiful, beautiful reality  
A beautiful reality  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful reality

[Verse 1]  
Clipped wings, I was a broken thing  
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing  
You would wind me down  
I struggled on the ground  
So lost, the line had been crossed  
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk  
You held me down  
I struggle to fly now  
  
[Bridge]  
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny  
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive  
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no  
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not gon' care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now I fly, hit the high notes  
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight  
You held me down  
But I fought back loud  
  
[Bridge]  
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny  
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive  
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide  
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no  
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not gon' care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I shout it out like a bird set free  
No I don't care if I sing off key  
I find myself in my melodies  
I sing for love, I sing for me  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free  
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Without a sound ever heard  
Without a lesson I have learned  
You are foolish  
And diluted  
  
Too many lies have you burned  
Where there's eyes to be found  
This seems life's underground  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
I could never let you stay  
  
Cause you blow it all away  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
  
If you go  
I will stall  
  
Yes I see it  
Yes I feel it  
You have no oppressions at all  
  
But if life is truly devoured  
I'll strip your bare 'till the truth comes out  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
  
You blow it all  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
  
Blow it all, blow it all, blow it all, away  
  
Forever is your mind to be naive  
Remember it will bring us to our years  
You blow it all away  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
  
You blow it all  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all, blow it all, blow it all  
Blow it all, blow it all, blow it all  
  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
You blow it all away

Help, I have done it again  
I have been here many times before  
Hurt myself again today  
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Be my friend, hold me  
Wrap me up, unfold me  
I am small, and needy  
Warm me up, and breathe me  
  
Ouch, I have lost myself again  
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found,  
Yeah I think that I might break  
Lost myself again, and I feel unsafe  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Bring night, bring the night on  
Bring a little bit of dance, bring a little bit of song, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
I'm not sure I can wait and this day has felt so long, yeah  
  
Bring night, bring the night on  
The music cuts into me and I know it can't be wrong, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
'Cuz all that we are after is a little bit of fun, yeah  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Bring night, bring the night on  
Bring me the moon and stars and send away the sun, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
Or maybe if I'm lucky I'll end up in your arms  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Bring night, bring the night on

[Verse 1]  
Laying down in your arms  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
Rough seas will be calm  
I'm home while we weather the storm  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We fall down like dogs playing dead  
Well our love's not worth playing chicken, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's [?] in our past  
When we are where we're meant to be  
Learn things I don't ask  
[?] get her to me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We fall down like dogs playing dead  
Well our love's not worth playing chicken, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
  
[Outro]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

You got me pushing imaginary buttons  
Step away from me lover, away from me lover  
You got me counting imaginary school children  
Get away from me lover, away from me lover  
Yes, I can see that your carpet is animated  
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover  
Yes, I see open wounds in everyone I've dated  
Away from me lover, get away from me lover  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do, oh oh oh oh  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do, oh oh oh oh  
You got me turning all the lights on and off  
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover  
When will you see that I am carrying this stuff?  
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover  
Can't you see that I am losing my marbles?  
It's marvelous losing another, losing another  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do, oh oh oh oh  
I am no good for you  
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do, oh oh oh oh  
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover  
Get away from me lover, away from me lover  
Step away from me lover, away from me lover  
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover

Pick me up in your arms  
Carry me away from harm  
You're never gonna put me down  
I know you're just one good man  
You'll tire before we see land  
You're never gonna put me down  
  
Oh I've been running all my life  
I ran away, I ran away from good  
Yeah I've been waiting all my life  
You're not a day you're not day too soon  
  
Honey I will stitch you  
Darling I will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart  
  
You'll risk all this for just a kiss  
I promise I will not resist  
Promise you wont hold me down  
And when we reach a good place  
Let's be sure to leave no trace  
Promise they wont track us down  
  
Now I've been running all my life  
I ran away, I ran away from good  
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life  
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon  
  
Honey I will stitch you  
Darling i will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart  
  
I've been running all my life  
I ran away, I ran away from good  
Yeah I've been waiting all my life  
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon  
  
Oh honey I will stitch you  
Darling I will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart

Faint light of dawn  
I'm listening to you breathing in and breathing out  
Needing nothing  
You're honey dipped  
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world  
I can't feel my lips  
  
I'm going down, I don't want to change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down  
  
Then all of that's annulled and I'm anyone's everyone's  
We are one  
Your face becomes the sun  
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things  
Those little things  
The little things they bring  
  
I'm going down, I don't want to change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So now for restless mind, I could go either way  
  
Oh but, I'm going down, I don't wanna change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, don't let me  
Don't bring me down,  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down,  
  
There's nothing left to choose  
Oh I fight a word, I am right here  
Stay the night, protect me

"Don't Get Me Started"  
  
Don't want to be another craze  
How about rather not see and I turn my face  
Don't want to leave you unfinished  
And resting on the noise that you left  
I don't want to leave you mistaken, forsaken  
Lying with the rest  
  
I don't want you to be another  
Touch, you talk the conversation  
I don't want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
  
I don't want to be a woman last  
Yeah I wish you another man  
I don't want you to kill my name  
And ask if I'm hovering him  
I won't send and gather dust  
In the corners of your world  
Cause believe me, when you leave me  
It won't be a minute too soon  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
  
I don't want you to be another  
Touch, you talk the conversation  
I don't want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started  
Don't get me started

I eat food to satisfy my hunger  
I drink water to quench my thirst  
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up  
I prick with pin to watch it burst  
To make noise I use my breathe  
To unlock doors I use a key  
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes  
I use booze to unlock me  
  
I sweep so I can sleep  
I sweep so I can sleep  
  
Sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep  
  
I wear shoes so I can run  
As to avoid the broken glass  
I wear the pants because they suit me  
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass  
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh  
I'll close the door to have a cry  
They say that change and pain is a positive thing  
Have I changed since you died  
  
I sweep so I can sleep  
I sweep so I can sleep  
  
Sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep  
  
Don't ask me why I smoke  
I don't know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Don't ask me why I smoke  
I don't know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Don't ask me why I smoke  
I don't know  
But I drink to get drunk  
  
Don't ask me why I smoke  
I don't know  
But I drink to get drunk

And another one bites the dust  
But why can I not conquer love?  
And I might've got to be with one  
Why not fight this war without weapons?  
And I want it and I wanted it bad  
But there were so many red flags  
Now another one bites the dust  
And let's be clear, I trust no one  
  
You did not break me  
I'm still fighting for peace  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
I've got an elastic heart  
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart  
  
And I will stay up through the night  
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes  
And I know that I can survive  
I walked through fire to save my life  
And I want it, I want my life so bad  
And I'm doing everything I can  
Then another one bites the dust  
It's hard to lose a chosen one  
  
You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)  
I'm still fighting for peace  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart

Someone plugged you in  
And sadly they clipped your wings  
Now you can't fly away electric bird  
Yeah someone took your tweet  
One day they fed you that bad seed  
You can't fly away electric bird  
  
Well you're art, you fell into this part  
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart  
You used to be so smart  
You fluttered round the yard making your magic  
  
Got to set you free, you were blinded by deceit  
You can't fly away electric bird  
So now this rooms all staged  
While you're stuck there in that cage  
You can't fly away electric bird  
  
Well you're art, you fell into this part  
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart  
You used to be so smart  
You fluttered round the yard making your magic

I fought so hard for your heart, on the way down  
And I thought that I could save you from destruction  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
I was hurting, I couldn't let go, I couldn't leave you  
And I told myself, though it was hell, that we'd push through  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful

[Verse 1]  
I fought so hard for your heart, all the way down  
And I thought that I could save you from destruction  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
[Chorus]  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was hurting, I couldn't let go, I couldn't leave you  
And I told myself, don't [?] ourselves, that we push through  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
[Chorus]  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
[Chorus]  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful

Now I don't mind if you find that I'm a shoulder to cry on rely on  
But the burden is just too much I'm losing touch with myself and my health  
  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
  
Now I don't keep you from your sleep I need some ease I'm tired of trying to
please  
And it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between  
  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me  
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me

Healing is difficult  
Often results in psychosomatic  
I admit to enjoying drugs  
They get rid of tension, boredom and static  
Hate those adverse side effects  
Forcing the people who love me to scatter  
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite  
The way I see it really doesn't matter  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
To tell you the truth  
I can't believe I love you so much  
So much in fact that I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch  
I have a sick sense of humor  
It amazes me how points it scores  
I'm addicted to vice  
My best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Simple to see why I breathe  
No one bothers me completely  
  
Simple to see why I breathe  
No one bothers me completely  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Waking up next to you  
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy  
The flies in the front room  
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me  
If I contract illness  
The last thing I want is to pass it to others  
Fucking leaves guilt pangs  
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

"I Don't Want To Want You"  
  
I like to take you  
Only cause I choose not to leave you  
I like to make something of you  
Only cause I choose to believe in you  
  
I don't want to want you like I do  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do  
  
I, I, I like to show you  
Only cause I choose not to hide from you  
I like to know you  
Only cause I choose to introduce myself  
Only cause I choose to introduce myself  
  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do, like I do  
  
I like to take you  
Only cause I choose not to leave you  
I like to make something of you  
Only cause I choose to believe in you

When I look up from my pillow  
I dream you are there with me  
Though you are far away  
I know you'll always be near to me  
  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
  
I look around me  
And feel you are ever so close to me  
Each tear that flows from my eye  
Brings back memories of you to me  
  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
  
I was wrong, I will cry  
I will love you till the day I die  
You were all, you alone and no one else  
You were meant for me  
  
When morning comes again  
I have the loneliness you left me  
Each day drags by  
Until finally my time descends on me  
  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me

Mind you mind me  
You thought you could climb me  
I'm sorry to cut your rope  
Bu in you I've lost all hope  
Mind you mind me  
I haven't seen you lately  
Oh how many times you liked to phone  
To see if your seed I could sow  
  
I tell you if that's what you're about  
Friends like you I can do without  
  
Mind you mind me  
I laugh at your transparency  
You're my new best friend  
Your fucked up life can I mend  
Mind you mind me  
I find it interesting to see  
When I only offer you a smile, oh how  
You forget to dial  
  
Believe me, I know you work  
Insidiously  
  
Mind you mind me, you smile so sweetly  
I'd call you an acquaintance stop with  
Your exaggeration  
Mind you mind me  
How things can change is a good week  
Call me ruthless  
But you stretch the truth oh yes  
  
I tell you if that's what you're about  
Friends like you I can do without

Watching the sequence of sounds  
Coming out of your mouth  
But the snore is too loud  
Follow the hands as they move  
Try to make out your move  
But my brain doesn't want to  
Silent call for you  
What have I done to you  
  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart  
  
Interpret the eyes as they die  
Should i cry should I love  
Your poor lashes blow  
Victim of sensory love  
You cry over my  
An innocent call  
  
Silent call for you  
What have I done to you  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart  
  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart

You were waiting for me, adore me, you saw me  
As I wish the whole world could  
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me  
For all the things you thought you could  
You would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry  
How I missed you when I was gone  
Hurt me so to leave you deceive you I needed you  
I believed in you.  
  
So I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
I'm trying not to fall apart  
  
All I have are pictures and stitches and riches  
But money could never buy what you give  
Though my heart is achin' and breakin' I'm takin'  
Most of what you send my way  
I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told  
I am coming back for you  
I know we will be okay everyday  
The sun shines a little brighter  
  
So I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
I'm trying not to fall apart  
I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
I'm trying not to fall apart  
I'm trying not to fall apart  
  
When in the night we'll set a light  
I'm wishing with all of my mind  
Oh no, I never meant to let you down  
Never meant to let you down  
I'm trying not to fall apart  
I never let you down  
I never meant to let you down  
I'm trying not to fall apart.

I'm being dragged down, down by the hand  
The hand of a golden giant man  
He's crushing my knuckles  
Splitting my skin, he says he will  
If only I'd ask it of him  
  
He says  
Girl, it's your call  
You wanna fly  
You wanna fall  
So I shout  
I wanna get away from you  
As fast as I can  
I tell my feet to move it  
I hope they have a plan  
  
[Chorus]  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Are heading the right way  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Saved my life today  
  
So now I'm free  
Free  
From the big bad giant  
  
Who was stalking me  
Thank you feet, for guiding me  
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I'm tempted  
Sometimes I am  
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man  
He was the line between pleasure and pain  
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim  
  
[Chorus]

So naive, it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when I'm feeling low I know  
I'm your greatest fan  
  
Little man I'm endlessly proud of you  
In such a short time span  
You've filled my heart with joy  
As I grow older, you grow wiser  
Watching my mistakes  
Memorize where I've gone wrong  
  
If they fall way  
I'll stay with you  
But do as I say and not as do  
Trust me and you'll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
Little man your head is full of dreams  
If only I could spend one day touring  
Your imagination  
If I live longer you'll grow faster  
At recognizing the traps that cause  
Me such frustration  
  
If they fall way  
I'll stay with you  
But do as I say and not as I do  
Trust me and you'll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
So naive, it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when I'm feeling low I know  
I'm your greatest fan

I was walking dead inside my head  
I couldn't get out, turn the lights down  
Voices inside are so loud.  
  
Needed a jump-start, catatonia  
I couldn't feel, I wish that I could dissapear  
The voices inside were so real.  
  
But you stood by my side.  
Night after night, night after night.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah  
  
You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive  
You loved me back to life, back to life, thought I died  
The voices inside were so quiet.  
  
But you used stood by my side  
Night after night, light up the night  
You love me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
  
Strong hands, thick skin and an open heart  
You saw through the pain, through the mask  
You never gave up on me, yeah  
  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight  
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life  
Back to life. Backt to life, back to life, back to life  
Yeah.

I watch you spin from afar  
I drink you in and breath you out  
I'm camouflaged by the time-line  
I'm camouflaged when the sun shines  
  
Two ships passing in the night  
Two lips pressing ground the tides  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be, I am the moon  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be, I am the moon  
  
I long to be a part  
I isolate my heart  
You've drawn me into your world  
Now I too spin limbless  
  
One hand clapping, where's the wind  
I stand spanning at your distant wings  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be, I am the moon

[Verse 1]  
Oh no, you broke a heart again  
Now I can't help but feel foolish and ashamed  
I am a broken record, a glitch in your iPod  
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby just burn we'll see  
I don't need you to believe in  
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see  
  
[Chorus]  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out  
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is
beating  
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh no, I let you fool me once  
Shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me  
Am I a scratched CD? A glitch in your download?  
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby just burn we'll see  
I don't need you to believe in  
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see  
  
[Chorus]  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out  
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is
beating  
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh baby just burn we'll see  
I don't need you to believe in  
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out (I'm doing fine
without you)  
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is
beating (I'm doing fine without you)  
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me

My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, leave you blind  
My love, you have found peace  
You were searching for release  
  
You gave it all  
You gave into the call  
You took a chance and  
You took a fall for us  
  
You give thoughtfully, loved me faithfully  
You taught me honor, you did it for me  
  
Tonight you will sleep for good  
You will wait for me my love  
  
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)  
You gave me all  
You gave all you had and now I am home  
  
My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, leave you blind  
My love, look what you can do  
I am mending, I'll be with you  
  
You took my hand and added a plan  
You gave me your heart  
I asked you to dance with me  
  
You loved honestly  
Did what you could release  
  
I know in peace you go  
I won't relieve this love  
  
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)  
You gave me all  
You gave all you had and now I am home  
  
My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, I'll be with you

We are anything but unremarkable  
We found things that we have given up on  
We were two peas in a pod  
Oh yeah  
  
Pleasing me seven good deeds  
I'm a man of strengths a man indeed  
We found things we had given up upon  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above  
You're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above you're here  
And you're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
You're never gonna leave me  
  
You touched my heart and then gave me yours  
I was so afraid I tried to ignore all the butterflies  
Taking me over  
  
We are anything but unremarkable  
We found things that we have given up on  
We found love  
  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above you're here  
And you're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above you're here  
And you're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above you're here  
And you're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now I'm taking your love from above you're here  
And you're never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me

I saw you cry today  
The pain may fill you  
I saw you shy away  
The pain will not kill you  
  
You made me smile today  
You spoke with many voices  
We traveled miles today  
Shared expressions voiceless  
  
It has to end  
  
[Chorus]  
Living in your head  
Without anything to numb you  
Living on the edge  
Without anything to numb you  
  
It has to end to begin  
  
Began and end today  
Gave and got given  
You made a friend today  
Kindred soul cracked spirit  
  
It has to end to begin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It had to end to begin  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 1]  
Under the moonlight  
Weathering with your warm embrace  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I feel so safe here  
Baby we're worth the wait  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Yeah I picked the wrong kind  
Time after time  
I drank from the poisoned wine  
Yeah I picked the wrong kind  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
But baby you're alright  
Yeah baby I seen the light  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
Danger is coming, a danger is coming  
A danger is coming  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
The war has been won here, the war has been won here  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze  
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe  
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way  
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
Cause I'd take, one million bullets babe  
  
[Verse 2]  
If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse  
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you  
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have  
Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
Danger is coming, a danger is coming  
A danger is coming  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
The war has been won here, the war has been won here  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze  
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe  
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way  
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
Cause I'd take, one million bullets babe

I, I, I never would have thought it would end this way, I lied  
I never have believed that we would separate  
What we have now is how it stands  
And now I wish you'll try to make it stay  
The way we are is here and now  
I wish you'd make the most of all we have today  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot  
  
I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more  
I never meant to let you down, down  
Though the silver lining wears through  
I still do not mean to hurt you, no  
When the sound of your voice is not ringing through  
Beginning to question whether I should be around  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot

[Verse 1]  
Broke down, thought that I would drown  
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground  
Sun rays out the corner of my eye, hey  
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping  
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's dawn  
I feel so strong  
Saw you out the corner of my eye  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I'mma savor it  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I remember when  
(Reaper)  
  
[Chorus]  
You came to take me away  
So close I was to heaven's gates  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
Oh, you tried to track me down  
You followed me like the darkest cloud  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
  
[Verse 2]  
So come back when I'm good to go  
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold  
I got good things to do with my life, yeah  
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze  
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing  
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I'mma savor it  
Don't come for me today

You don't, know me  
You can't, hold me  
I'll slip through your hands  
I am one single grain of sand  
  
[Chorus]  
You are free to love  
Happily received  
You are free to love  
If that is all you need  
  
I'm an empty space  
I can't be replaced  
So when you're finished with this dream  
Delete begin to rewrite me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You are free to love  
Happily received  
You are free to love  
Delete and rewrite me

[Verse 1]  
Donely float got in the way  
You are the feel, and knew it anyway  
Take a chance, it wasn't what you know  
Take my hand, and don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, ooh ooh  
You can do it,  
Don't break

You're safe!  
Yes, you can do it  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe

Give your heart, and say come take it  
And she will see you're a good man

You're safe  
  
Yes, you can do it,  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe!

By the window  
Since time began  
Watch the wind blow  
Sculpting sand  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
  
Burning castle  
Turning down  
Mr. Prince has lost her crown  
All in letters bound in string  
Time is slowly unraveling  
  
She sells  
Empty sea shells  
Lost in the ocean  
Through the window  
We can see  
Sand and biscuits  
Cups of tea  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
She sells  
Empty sea shells  
She sells  
Empty sea shells

"Shadow"  
  
One, two  
  
Yes, you can take that to heart  
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway  
You can make it a big issue  
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok  
  
You can feign a distant familiarity  
Say you understand the similarity  
Think you see me with great clarity  
But you're actually not necessarily  
  
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know  
  
Yes, you can call that a start  
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway  
Yes, your deceit is an art  
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway  
  
You say you have the best intentions  
You fill me with fickle suggestions  
Logic is fired by inventions  
But your concern is much more than you mention  
  
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know  
  
You say you're in my situation  
You say you've been confused by my complication  
You think my soul makes negotiation  
But you don't see my hesitation  
  
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

"Soon"  
  
Like a new winter's coat  
I'm wearing your last embrace  
Like a cold quenching glass of water  
I hold a clear picture of your face  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty  
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty  
  
I'm hearing your last telephone call  
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest  
I hear your invitation to see it all  
Better written I am smitten no protest  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be bored and lonely  
Soon I'll be bored and lonely  
  
Like a story well told  
Your conversation can hold me or soothe me  
Like a funny time to share you were there  
And your comfort and support me  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be restless and weary  
Soon I'll be restless and weary  
  
Like another man  
I want hold you within me  
Like a good day without care  
I just want you to last  
I just want you to last  
  
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine  
The sweet taste linger left on lips  
I think of your kisses with mine  
The sweet taste lingers left on lips  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed  
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed

"Stories"  
  
How can I climb inside you  
The way that you're climbing inside me  
How could I ever deny you  
The way that you never deny me  
How can I climb inside you  
Touching the parts that people really see  
How can I open and find you  
And feel you the way that you want me to feel  
  
I want you to know what I'm thinking of  
I want you to read my mind before I write it  
I want you to know that I have stories to tell  
I wanna tell you a little bit more  
  
How do I get to align with you  
Let's tell our times and we'll see  
If we can piece together something  
Or something else that will be  
  
Can't believe that you're less  
I'm still not against your will  
A change that you really want too  
If I pour it all out  
Will you still have no doubt  
There's a reason or two that you are too  
  
I want you to know what I'm thinking of  
I want you to read my mind before I write it  
I want you to know that I have stories to tell  
I wanna tell you a little bit more  
  
How can I climb inside you  
The way that you're climbing inside me  
How could I ever deny you  
The way that you never deny me  
How can I climb inside you  
Touching the parts that people really see  
How can I open and find you  
And feel you the way that you want me to feel  
  
I want you to know what I'm thinking of  
I want you to read my mind before I write it  
I want you to know that I have stories to tell  
I wanna tell you a little bit more  
  
Can't believe that you're less  
I'm still not against your will  
A change that you really want too  
If I pour it all out  
Will you still have no doubt  
There's a reason or two that you are too

For those who've slept  
For those who've kept  
Themselves jacked up  
How Jesus wept  
Sunday  
Sunday  
  
For those in need  
For those who speed  
For those who try to slow their minds with weed  
Sunday  
Sunday  
  
For those who wake  
With a blind headache  
Who must be still  
Who will sit and wait  
For Sunday, to be Monday  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, it will be ok  
Do nothing today  
Give yourself a break  
Let your imagination run away  
  
For those with guilt  
For those who wilt  
Under pressure  
No tears over spilt milk  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
I, I, I, I, I  
Oh no no, yeah

She cooks you sweet potato you don't like aubergine  
She knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease  
She senses you are lonely but still she can't be sure  
And so she stands and waits stands anticipating  
  
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be to understand you  
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be to understand you  
  
He brushes thoroughly  
He knows she likes fresh breath  
He rushes to the station  
He waits atop the steps  
He's brought with him a mars bar  
She will not buy nestle  
And later he'll perform  
A love-lorn serenade, a trade  
  
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be to understand you  
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be to understand you  
  
So give her information to help her fill her holes  
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled  
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in  
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin  
  
Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest  
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed  
I hate that you negate me, I'm a ghost at beck and call  
I'm failing and placating, berate myself for staying  
  
I'm a fool  
I'm a fool  
  
He greets his stranger meekly a thing that she accepts  
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps  
He senses she is lonely she's glad they finally met  
They take each other's hands walk into the sunset  
  
(Do you like sweet potato?)

I'm sitting in the car again  
Waiting for you  
You said you'd be a minute  
But you've been twenty two  
See you've got to do your hair  
And get it just right  
Sometimes you're in the bathroom  
For half of the night  
  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Yes I'm waiting for you  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Yes I'm waiting for you  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
  
Now I'm sitting by the phone again  
Waiting for your call  
You'd said you'd phone at two  
And it's a quarter past four  
Now I'm standing out the front  
Again  
It's late at night  
And I'm truly sick to death of  
Sleazy men  
Undressing me with their eyes  
  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Yes I'm waiting for you  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Yes I'm waiting for you  
And I'm waiting for you again  
Tell me what can I do  
  
Now I'm back back from  
The theater  
I watched the show alone  
I waited for you and  
I missed half act one  
Have you never heard  
Of the phone  
I don't like being  
Taken for granted  
I'm too nice for my own good  
See I do what I say  
And I say what I do  
Is it too much to expect  
That you could  
I wish you would  
  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
I ain't waiting for you  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
Go find another fool  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
I ain't waiting for you  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
It's the usual coup  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
I ain't waiting for you  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
May I show you the door  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
I ain't waiting for you  
I ain't waiting for you no more  
I ain't missing nothing for you

I want to change, to rearrange  
What is going on  
I need to change, I need to play  
Like a five year old  
  
I can't detach from the past and all of the pain  
I need to learn, start from scratch begin again  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw away yesterday  
Today is a brand new day  
Throw away yesterday  
Today is a brand new day  
  
So I'm going to eat one hundred sweets  
I don't care if I get fat  
And I'm going to speak one I won't censor me  
I know I can take nothing back  
  
And I'm going to jump I will unburden  
I cannot go too deep  
I will not run from bad things I've done  
They're things I'll try not to repeat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Welcome to  
The church of what's happening now  
Head straight through  
It costs nothing but change  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Today, yes today,  
And today is a brand new day  
Throw away, yesterday  
'Cause today is a brand new day

We are born  
Without a care  
As we grow old  
But unaware  
As we grow tall  
Begin to falter  
We want to know ourselves  
Spread love to all  
  
But we fall down cause we are human  
Yes sweet anger will feed the hunger  
Yes we push through  
Just me and you  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes, we stand to gain love  
  
A fantasy for you and me  
A beauty light and reality  
No need to feel  
The proof that something  
For all of it is love and harmony  
  
But we falter and yes we are flawed  
As we play victim to such conviction  
And breathe heavily  
Both you and me  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes, we stand to gain love  
  
For the day by day  
Worried we would fail  
How we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in pain  
Took it step by step  
We could not forget the wounds we felt  
And how we screamed for help  
From the dark, dark nights when you held me tight  
And we prayed for light to rescue us  
Yeah, we were distressed  
Now we're nothing less  
We are strong  
We are blessed  
We are united  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes, we stand to gain love  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes, we stand to gain love

Without truth  
We lose  
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love  
Don't cry  
We've all lied  
But there is always room for forgiveness my friend  
  
[Chorus]  
So don't treat me bad just be glad I am strong  
I know where I belong  
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete  
There's a place here for you with me  
  
Shine  
You're fine  
See I will always have a smile for you my love  
And still  
We will  
Be ok and along the way we'll learn a thing or two  
  
[Chorus: x7]

You shot me up, yeah  
You filled my cup, oh  
You sailed my boat  
You were my last hope  
You took my very last hope away  
  
Oh you, you will be loved by someone good  
And you, you will be loved by somebody good  
You have been loved  
  
You dropped the bomb  
And now you're gone  
I held you dear  
You swallowed my fears  
And now I've drunk my last beer with you  
  
Oh you, you have been loved by someone good  
Yeah you, you will be loved  
Oh will you ever know  
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago  
Only sadness remains  
And it will pass  
  
Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good  
By somebody good

Hey, America  
Let's turn it up  
Yeah check out ourselves  
Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
Your clothes may be Chanel, Gucci  
Your shoes crocodile  
But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all  
We got all we need, got no more  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all  
If it's real, you'll open every door  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
Ready or not, give all we've got  
Yeah you can't deny  
That baby you're never fully dressed without a smile  
Don't sink the boat when you lose hope  
I keep you alive  
But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all  
We got all we need, got no more  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all  
If it's real, you'll open every door  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
Now look at us  
We pick it up  
We set it on fire  
Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile  
We show it out  
We're playing now  
We're living the life  
But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile  
  
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all  
We got all we need, got no more  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all  
If it's real, you'll open every door  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile  
You're never fully dressed without a smile
