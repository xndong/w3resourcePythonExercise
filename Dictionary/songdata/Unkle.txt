They say if you took it all away  
This love would fall apart  
I say, no way  
You don't know the size of my heart.  
Vicious, suspicious  
It doesn't matter what I say  
Users and losers  
There's nothing here to make me stay.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain  
No gain with no pain  
My scars are deeper than you think  
Tie me, try me  
One more time before I sink.  
Big lies, big times  
This love is not what we're about  
It's too late, and I'm too straight  
It's time to blow this fire out.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take me softly  
I'm going crazy for your touch.  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
(Blue, blood, blue, blood, blue, blood)  
Take it with no shame  
(No, take, no, take, no, take)  
I'm alone  
And dissatisfied  
And someone else is alone  
And dissatisfied  
You are alone?

Dead state I can feel the weight  
Light streaming in through the open grate  
Tooth red score tearing up the floor  
Out in the alley with the trigger draw  
  
Numb hands I can see the strand  
Hold it together with a severed band  
Three lost years I've been crying here  
I'm over, I'm over, I'm over, I'm broken  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back, soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
We're miles adrift, we're inches apart  
  
I'm hit I can feel the grit  
Sat in the asher on the beaten brick  
Tooth red main running through the vein  
Out in the center with a mirrored cane  
  
Numb feet I can hear you speak  
Hold it together with a severed streak  
Three long years I've been crying here  
I'm over, I'm over, I'm over, I'm broken  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back, soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
We're miles adrift, we're inches apart  
  
Stood up on the side of the earth  
Thrown back to the track to the dirt  
Tooth red, lose an hour a day  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
  
Strung out on the wings of the dawn  
Hole in the back, soul in the storm  
Torn down through the cracks in the dark  
We're miles adrift, we're inches apart  
  
Stood up on the side of the earth  
Thrown back to the track to the dirt  
Tooth red, lose an hour a day  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
We're miles adrift, we're inches away  
  
Hold it together, with a severed band  
Can't feel the blood

Ordo ob kao, 'Order out of chaos', and the idea is that, uh, with the  
influence of powerful forces behind the scene, you can bring order out of the  
chaos that we see. We know, for instance, that much of the  
An eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God,,  
In order and disorder, is always there  
I think he has nothing to support this. why-you're so full of it!  
Aliens, protecting society how? Chaos happens.  
There's too many people here  
Gotta learn the way to turn  
Hat over eye  
Feeling dead more than alive  
Give her something to rely on  
One more time.  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby.  
No way in, no way out  
Empty talk and TV shouts  
Got to find the way around  
No, you ain't no lifer  
In this town.  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby.  
Stop the beat, hear the sound  
Time has come for you to speak  
Your mind  
Can't you hear the sound?  
Chaos all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby  
Dee-dee-dee  
Dee-dee-dee  
Learn to fly.

Even now in heaven  
There were angels carrying savage weapons

What are you to me?

And I wrote my happiest songs  
Every child may joy to you  
What's wrong?  
Nothing but the real  
It is you that needed something stronger  
  
I need something stronger...  
  
If you have a problem don't hesitate to ask for assistance  
  
What's wrong...  
  
What's wrong?  
Nothing...  
  
What's wrong...?  
  
What's wrong...?  
  
(What's wrong?)  
Wha, wha, wha, wha, wha.....  
  
Can you feel this?  
What is that buzzing?  
Are you now, or have you ever, moved slowly?  
  
I need something stronger  
  
?????  
???????  
  
(What's wrong...?)  
(What's wrong...?)  
  
What's wrong?  
It's just a matter by you looking it, that's all...

My mind is in a state  
'Cause all I seem to do is tempt my fate  
Well I try every space  
But all the while we're crushing at the gate  
This time, this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
'Cause everything I miss it comes too late  
So I try and disappear  
But there is only one way out of here  
This time, this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
But all I need to do is change my pace  
And I know there's fear to face  
But happiness is firm in its embrace  
This time.

Sample  
The only thing that burns in hell  
Is the part of you that won't let go of your life  
Your memories, your attachments  
They burn them all away,  
But they're not punishing you, they say  
They're freeing your soul, relax.  
  
Somethings gone  
This can't go on  
It's all been wrong  
For far too long  
  
Through all these tears  
No light appears  
And all that trust  
Has turned to dust  
  
So one things clear  
I wanna hear  
I wanna hear  
  
So break on through  
For something true  
'cause love's confused  
  
And love does see  
Sense in all of this  
Something's gotta give  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
In time  
You'll find  
In time  
You'll find  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me

Show them only  
Flesh you needed  
You want it for you too  
(stares, stares that follow)  
(stares, stares that follow)  
  
They want it for you  
Are you all that  
You're cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
(laughter's coming)  
  
And goodbye kisses  
Gave him family  
Pray your dream  
Pray you're dreaming  
  
Are you all that  
You're cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Stares that follow  
Friends to call on  
Don't be desperate  
(show them once)  
  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
Laughter's coming  
Goodbye kisses  
(pray you stutter)  
(pray it's not old)  
Goodbye.

I shoot it low, kill the flow  
Ruin myself out on the north shore  
I make it one, watch the sun  
Sink behind the trees with the keys to the kingdom  
  
I shoot it high, let it fly  
Bury myself under a blue sky  
I see a scheme, make it clean  
Drown in blue rivers under a muffled scream  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
I hit it down, kill the sound  
Ruin myself out on the northbound  
I make it one, kill the sun  
Bury my disease with the keys to the kingdom  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
I shoot it low  
Shoot it low  
Kill the flow  
Kill the flow  
Ruin myself out on the north shore  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again  
  
Call your number wishing I could make amends  
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again

In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and no strain  
  
Let it rise  
Way out of control  
You can't disguise  
What's inevitable  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain  
  
Ooo-aaoh  
Ooo-aaoh  
Ooo-aaoh  
  
'Cause your time is getting more than ever  
  
In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain

God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I believe there's a time and a place  
To let your mind drift and get out of this place  
I believe there's a day and a place  
That we will go to, and I know you want to share.  
  
There's no secret to living (There's no secret to living)  
Just keep on walking  
There's no secret to dying (There's no secret to dying)  
Just keep on flying.  
  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
I'm gonna die in a space that don't hold my fame.  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls.  
  
I believe there's a time when the cord of life  
Should be cut, my friends (Cut the cord, my friend)  
I believe there's a time when the cord can be cut  
And this vision ends (Let this vision end).  
  
But I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
And I'm gonna cry in a space that don't hold my fame.  
  
Walking in the cold  
Just keep on flying  
There'll be a searchlight  
On the mountain high  
  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
God knows you're lonely souls  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I'm a lonely soul.  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name  
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name.  
  
God knows you are lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
I'm a lonely soul.  
  
So long, little chapel  
Pack up your light  
Pack up your light  
Say goodbye to the holy water life  
Oh  
Ah

As I juxtapose  
Between lock and load  
Gotta cut some slack  
Between these back to back panic attacks  
(panic attack panic attack)  
  
I love the madness  
It's killing me  
Our love is behind  
And I'm so blind I cannot see  
  
As I juxtapose  
In between lock and load  
Gotta cut some slack  
Between these back to back panic attacks

Our love is behind  
And I'm so blind I cannot see

I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Scared of the spotlight  
You don't come to visit  
I'm stuck in this bed  
  
Thin rubber gloves  
She laughs when she's crying  
She cries when she's laughing  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
(Away... away... away...)  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
Washed down the toilet  
Money to burn  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
  
If you're frightened of dyin' and you're holding on...  
You'll see devils tearing your life away.  
But...if you've made your peace,  
Then the devila are really angels  
Freeing you from the earth... from the earth... from the earth  
  
Rotworms on the underground  
Caught between stations  
Butterfingers  
I'm losing my patience  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
You got money to burn....  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
Away, away, away,  
Away, away, away.

The ripples that becoming the crashing waves  
I am the rain, rain oh, rain oh, reign all day

You thought a different day had come  
A day you thought the earth was done  
And if you could have said it all

Well I'm all restless but I don't care  
You don't like me much, well me neither  
You go me, my, ma, like you're some kind of God  
You live like someone trippin' on the same one you lost  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
  
Got this sinking feeling, so if I sing it it's true  
There ain't no habit that I will not defend  
If it comes back well I will not resend  
I'm broken, house broken  
Now you on the mend  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
  
Those who pay, will just pay it again  
Never beginning nor a jewel at the end  
Rip me from the breakage and solvents  
Taking over, I'll just take what you got  
  
I'm in you, you're on me  
I'm in you, you're on me  
You're the truth, I do believe  
I'm in you, you're on me  
Easy

Your skull-fucked little lives  
In shadows where you hide  
A life that was designed  
You've been cheated oh so blind  
You laid it on the line  
These twisted words of time  
And how your spirit shines  
I wish that you were mine  
Yeah lately I know that I've been crawling  
I know that I've been falling  
Into your dream  
Imagine no more tears  
Dissolving all your fears  
With tooth and claw we fight  
Into this endless night  
Yeah lately I know that I've been crawling  
I know that I've been falling  
Into your dream  
I saw my tears in your eyes  
You saw your fears in mine  
We watched it burn together  
Watched it burn together  
Burn yeah, burn watched it burn burn yeah burn  
Watched it burn, burn watched it burn  
Watched it burn, burn watched it burn  
All is forgiven.
