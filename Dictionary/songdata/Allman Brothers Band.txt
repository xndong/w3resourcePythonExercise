Ridin' in a long gray limousine.  
Sittin' in a pair of hundred dollar jeans.  
Tryin' to talk sense to a rock'n'roll queen.  
Damn, best kinda livin' anybody ever seen.  
Oh, Angeline.  
  
[Chorus]  
Lookin' at the bright lights, searchin' for the sliver screen.  
I never seen a woman who could look so good,  
And be so doggone mean. Yeah.  
Oh, midnight struttin' in New York City.  
Midnight woman, she is lookin' so pretty.  
Her little heart beat in rhythm with the world.  
She used to be her mama's little girl.  
Hey, hey Angeline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, just a game that she loves to play,  
Leavin' broken hearts all along the way.  
She's got friends that she ain't never used.  
She's winnin' now but she's bound to lose.  
Oh, Angeline.  
  
[Chorus]

Say you want to be a rollin' stone  
?n get your sail out in the wind  
Get out on the highway  
And just let it roll on  
Roll on back to someplace you ain't never been  
Hey, hey  
When I was younger  
I was hard to hold  
Seem like I's always goin'  
Whichever way the wind was blowin'  
Now that travelin' feelin'  
Calls me again  
Callin' me back where it all begins  
  
Moon rise  
And sun go down  
Turn my whole world around  
Little star up in the sky  
Tell my sweet baby  
Please don't cry  
Please don't cry  
  
Moon rise  
And sun go down  
Turn my whole world around  
Little star up in the sky  
Tell my sweet baby  
Please don't cry  
Please don't cry  
  
Travel out  
Across the burnin' sand  
Across the ocean  
To some distant land  
When we reach the end  
We'll all be singin'  
And we'll all be friends  
Back where it all begins  

You know I hate to leave you babe  
But I just can't waste my time....  
Well you've got this jealous husband  
And I'm far too young to die,  
I must move on away from here  
Just before the bullets fly  
  
I've always been a gabler  
Takin' chances all my life....  
Always smashin' those love affairs  
Just like shootin' dice,  
I staged the game girl  
That's what keeps me satisfied  
And I can leave it in the nick of time  
Just before the bullets fly  
  
Solo  
  
I lost my first bet  
When I was twenty-one  
Found myself in New Orleans  
On the wrong end of a gun....  
The stakes keep getting higher......  
But somehow I Survive,  
By knowin' when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly  
I'm knowing when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly  
I'm knowing when the need became  
Just before the bullets fly

Black hearted woman, can't you see your poor man dyin'.  
Can't count on both hands, babe, all the lonely nights I've been cryin'.  
Well I'm tired of all your slippery ways, I can't take your evil lyin'.  
Oh, no.  
Black hearted woman, cheap trouble and pain is all you play.  
Black hearted woman, cheap trouble and pain is all you play.  
Some time thinking I'll be much better, if I was stiff down in my grave.  
No, I just can't stay.  
Yesterday I was your man, now you don't know my name.  
Yesterday I was your man, now you don't know my name.  
Well I'm going out to find a new way babe, oh, to get back into your game.  
Yeah, yeah.  
One of these days, I'm gonna catch you with your back door man.  
One of these days, yeah, I'm gonna catch you with your back door man.  
I'll be moving on down the road pretty baby, oh, to start all over again.  
Oh, yeah.

Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.  
Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.  
Lord, I still love that woman  
Even though I know she's gone, long gone.  
Lord, I know she's out walkin',  
Walkin' up and down the street.  
Well I know my baby's out walkin'  
Walkin' up and down the street.  
Lord she's got a brand new story  
For each and every man she meets.  
Blind love, blind love,  
It oughta be a crime,  
For lovin' you the way I do.  
My best friend knows all about it,  
He don't have a thing to say.  
Lord he knows all about it,  
He just don't have a thing to say.  
Oh, it hurts me so bad, to see you treat me this way.  
Well I see my baby walkin',  
Now I don't even raise my hand.  
When I see my baby walkin',  
I don't even raise my hand,  
Oh it hurts me in my heart,  
To see you with another man.  
Blind love, blind love,  
It oughta be a crime,  
For lovin' you the way I do.  
Blind love, blind love,  
It oughta be a crime,  
For lovin' you the way I do.  
Blind love, blind love,  
It oughta be a crime,  
For lovin' you the way I do.

Walk along the river, sweet lullaby, it just keeps on flowing,  
It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no.  
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walking down the road,  
Early morning sunshine tell me all I need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day.  
Lord, you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way,  
Turn your love my way, yeah.  
  
Good old Sunday morning, bells are ringing everywhere.  
Goin' to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]

Well you can take all of the money that you made and put it in the jar  
Drag out a map that will show you, is Heaven very far?  
You take all of the medicine you need 'til ya find out who you are  
Maybe you can figure why that woman wanna be so cruel  
But ya, ya just can't forget her, can you fool?  
  
Well those winter nights and the city lights and the crying of the train  
Everyday is a shade of gray, every memory's a fade  
And then ya finally use the sense God gave ya to come out of the rain  
Still you can't figure why that man is got to be so cruel  
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool?  
  
Oh, love is long and love is hard  
Love brings lots of pain  
She was here, now she's gone  
Lord, bring her back again  
  
Well you can take all of the money that you made and put it in the jar  
Drag out a map that will show you, is Heaven very far?  
And you can take all of the medicine you need 'til ya find out who you are  
Still you can't figure why that man he got to be so cruel  
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool?  
No, you just can't forget her, can you fool?  
Aww, can you fool?

I've heard it said before,  
That you don't care no more,  
You just pick up tracks,  
And don't look back,  
And walk right out that door.  
  
I tell my friends it's easy,  
She's never on my mind.....  
My life is so much better  
Since that day I said good-bye  
  
And I' tell myself I'm free  
But I'm only foolin' me  
Cause no matter what I do...  
I can't get over you  
  
Well I tried to hide my pain,  
With a taste of fast lane,  
But ain't no use... to shake you loose...  
I still feel the same  
I thought I could forget you  
But that was just a lie,  
I'm just not the same without you...  
I don't even want to try....  
  
And I' tell myself I'm free  
But I'm only foolin' me  
Cause no matter what I do...  
I can't get over you  
I can't get over you  
  
SOLO:  
  
BRIDGE:  
I don't know how it started  
I don't know where I stand  
I just want to be back in your arms once again  
  
And I' tell myself I'm free  
But I'm only foolin' me  
Cause no matter what I do...  
I can't get over you  
I can't get over you  
I can't get over you

Had a sweet little girl,  
Run out and took the baby boy, people ain't that sad.  
Oh, had a sweet little girl,  
Left me, run out and took the baby boy, oh ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't spend what you ain't got,  
Can't lose what you never had.  
Can't spend what you ain't got,  
Can't lose what you never had.  
  
Had some money in the bank,  
Got busted, people ain't that so sad.  
Oh, I had some money in the bank,  
Got busted, people, people ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Had a sweet little home,  
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.  
Oh, had a sweet little home,  
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, hmm, hmm, oh!

Can't take it with you.  
Everybody knows.  
Can't take it with you when you go.  
Can't hide your love away.  
Save it up for a rainy day.  
Ya can't take it with you when you go.  
And it hurts so bad when you finally have to show.  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't take it with you.  
Everybody knows.  
Can't take it with you when you go.  
Can't hide your love away.  
Save it up for a rainy day.  
You can't take it with you when you go.  
No, you can't take it with you when you go. Ooo.  
No, you can't take it with you when you go, oh, no.  
Play it high or low.  
Break the bank in Monte Carlo.  
You can play it just the way it falls.  
Cut it like you want to.  
But it just might come back and haunt you.  
Lady Luck's your mama when she calls.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hot-wire a fast car  
Just to take a ride.  
You can run, but you sure cannot hide.  
Oh, tell her a lie  
And live with it 'til you die, but you  
Can't take it with you when you go.  
  
[Chorus]

Ones I was on my one and falling  
Ones I was all alone and calling  
For some one anyone to day  
To help me just a little on my way  
And then I took a look around  
I saw all that love that surrounded me  
I know that it was all up to me and  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
  
You find you can't go on depending  
Always to help your in deep ending  
Your reason for being whom you are  
And asking for that lightest brightest star  
I thought that's all I had to do  
Was believing the things that was true to me  
And let it happen naturally  
And cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
  
I thought that's all I had to do  
Was believing the things that was true to me  
And let it happen naturally  
And cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me

I've got to change my way of living,  
'Cause trouble's all that I can see.  
I gotta change my way of living,  
Lord trouble's all that I can see.  
My life is in such a mess,  
There ain't no one to blame but me.  
My good girl tried to tell me,  
Wouldn't hear a thing she said.  
Lord my good girl tried to tell me,  
Wouldn't hear a lonesome thing she said.  
Now she's taken her things and left me,  
No place for me to lay my head.  
Blue, Lord I'm blue.  
Raining down on me.  
I gotta change my way of living,  
'Cause the blues is all I see.  
Blue, Lord I'm blue.  
Raining down on me.  
I gotta change my way of living,  
Change my way,  
The blues is all I see.  
Now when your luck runs out,  
That's when your friends will run out too.  
Lord, when your luck runs out,  
Your fair weather friends will run out too.  
You're a very lucky man, Lord  
If there is just one who'll stand by you.  
Blue, Lord I'm blue.  
The blues raining down on me.  
I gotta change my way of living,  
'Cause the blues is all I see.

People say that you're no good,  
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could.  
Well, I seem to stay down on the ground,  
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around.  
Oh, if only you would make up your mind,  
Take me where you go, you're leaving me behind.  
Lord, you got those come and go blues,  
Lord, you got those some and go blues,  
Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool.  
  
Round 'n' 'round, 'round we go,  
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know.  
Well maybe I'm a fool to care,  
Without your sweet love, baby I would be nowhere.  
Here I'll stay, locked in your web,  
Till that day I might find somebody else.  
I don't know just when that would be,  
I don't know, I can't say as I can't see.  
Lord you got me feeling like a fool.  
  
Sail on, darlin', sail on  
Woman, you go your way, and I'll go mine  
Seems to me, that I once heard  
That everything is finally cured by time  
So sail on, darlin', sail on  
Lord, I wish you good luck  
And I'll see you when you come next time.  
  
Woman, you got those come and go blues  
Yeah, you got those come and go blues,  
Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool.

You better come on into my kitchen  
Cause it's sure to be raining outdoors  
When a woman's in trouble  
Everybody puts her down  
  
She look for her good man  
Lord he can't be found  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
  
Because it's going to be raining outdoors  
There's a cold wind blowing  
Leaves tremblin' on the trees  
Don't you know that that good girl  
  
Ya she's leaving me  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
  
The woman I've been loving  
Left with my best friend  
That joker got lucky  
Stole her back again  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Well that good girl's leaving  
She ain't coming back  
Took her last nickel from her notion sack  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Mama's dead and gone  
Father's no where's to be  
I ain't got nobody  
To love and care for me  
  
You better come on  
Into my kitchen  
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors  
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors  
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors

Somewhere down on a back street  
Way down deep in the back seat  
Is where I first learned how to moan your name  
I remember on the night I met you  
Ooh, sweet baby, I just can't forget you  
And I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love  
  
Crazy love, crazy love  
I love you baby  
But your too bad to tame  
Crazy love, crazy love  
You got it all  
  
Laid up here lookin' at my shoes  
Stretched out with these hotel blues  
I wish you'd only just call me on the phone  
There ain't no doubt and I don't mean maybe  
Ooh, I just can't forget about you baby  
And I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love  
  
Crazy love, crazy love  
I love you baby  
But your too bad to tame  
Crazy love, crazy love  
You got it all  

By Robert Johnson  
  
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knee  
Down to the crossroad, fell down on my knee  
Asked the Lord above for mercy, take me if you please  
  
I went down to the crossroad, tried to flag a ride  
Down to the crossroad, tried to flag a ride  
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by  
  
When I'm goin' down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side  
Goin' down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side  
We can stil barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside  
  
You can run, you can run. Tell my friend, boy, Willie Brown  
Run, you can run. Tell my friend, boy, Willie Brown  
And I'm standin' at the crossroads. Belive I'm sinkin' down

Rain falls on a sleepy southern town  
The midnight moon burning brightly  
Memories rush in like a river forlorn  
As you lay sleeping without me  
Highway song keeps me rollin' on  
Still I long for you  
Desdemona, I will be your only one  
Oh yeah  
And I make my living pouring out my pain  
Trying to make it through another day  
Arms reach for me on the wind I can feel them  
They're a thousand miles away  
Your eyes remind me of everything beautiful and blue  
And I won't feel myself till I'm with you  
Desdemona, I will be your only one  
Oh yeah  
So hold a candle till the darkness fades  
Night time sleeps but not for long  
My heart is pounding like the ocean  
My soul's empty as the sky  
But I know, someday I'll be coming home  
Time goes by the twinkling of an eye  
Still I pine for you  
Desdemona, I will be your only one  
I just wanna be, oh, your only one  
I just wanna be your only one  
Your only one  

Can't get no this  
And I can't get no that  
Can't get no you know  
I don't even know where it's at  
Ain't got the smoke, and, uh, ain't no booze  
Got them low-down, dried-out desert blues, yes, I do  
Um, a George Carlin said I had to go  
Just what he wanted I did not know  
I'm over here, dug in so far from home  
Lookin' all around, try and see what's going on  
I got the sand in my collar  
Got the sand in my hair  
Got it in my pockets  
Got it everywhere  
I got sand in my shirt  
Got it in my shoes  
Got them low-down, dried-out desert blues, yes, I do, how, how, how  
Joined up in the army  
Where it was hard to find  
End up over here, got my ass on the line  
But I'll be right here until my work is done  
If I get back home, I hope I never see no more guns  
Here across the ocean  
I left some of my good friends behind  
I hope somebody's thinking about me  
Especially that sweet, little woman of mine  
Can't get no this  
And I can't get no that  
Can't get no you know  
I don't even know where it's at  
Sand in my collar  
Got the sand in my hair  
Got it in my pockets  
Got it everywhere  
I got sand in my shirt  
Got it in my shoes  
Got them low-down, dried-out desert blues  
Yes, I do

I love the way you walk  
I love the way you walk  
I love the way you walk, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you  
I see ya every day  
I see ya every day  
I see ya every day, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you  
(guitar solo)  
I love to see ya switch  
I love to see ya switch  
I love to see ya switch, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you  
You've Got Dimples on your jaw  
You've Got Dimples on your jaw  
You've Got Dimples on your jaw

The bell just tolled, my baby done caught that train and  
Gone  
Yes, the bell just tolled, my baby done caught that train and  
Gone  
It's all my fault, I must have done somebody wrong, oh  
Yeah  
Everything that happened, you know I am to blame  
Everything that's happened, you know I am to blame  
I'm gonna find me a doctor, maybe my luck will change, oh  
Yeah  
My mother told me these days would surely come,  
But I, wouldn't listen to her, said, "I gotta have some  
Fun"  
Aah, I must-a did somebody wrong,  
Uuh, it's all my fault, I must-a did somebody wrong

Oh, tell me 'bout the car I saw,  
Parked outside your door,  
Tell me what you left me waiting,  
Two or three hours for.  
  
Tell me why when the phone rings baby,  
You're up and across the floor,  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.  
I think about the bad times,  
  
Lord I think about yours and mine,  
You were lost in the silver spoon,  
Thought I pulled you out in time.  
And I hope that you got reasons,  
  
For the way that you've been lyin',  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.  
I think I'm gonna go now,  
But you know that I'll be back.  
  
Now you can think it over Baby,  
Tell me how you're gonna act.  
I'm gonna keep on holding on,  
But I don't get no stronger,  
  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.

Just one more mornin, I had to wake up with the blues.  
Pulled myself out of bed, yeah, put on my walkin shoes.  
And went up on the mountain, to see what I could see.  
The whole world was fallin, right down in front of me.  
  
'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby.  
Ah, help me baby, or, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah.  
  
Pull myself together, put on a new face.  
Climb down off the hilltop, baby, get back in the race.  
  
Lord, cause I've a hunger for dreams I'll never see, yeah, babe.  
Lord, help me baby, or, this will surely be the end of me, yeah.  
  
Pull myself together, put on a new face.  
Climb down off the hilltop, baby, and get back in the race.  
  
'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby.  
Ah, help me baby, or, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah.

Well, yes, people I am a poor, drunken hearted boy.  
Well, yeah, people I am a poor, drunken hearted boy.  
I have a whole ocean of trouble,  
And just a little, half pint of joy.  
  
I drink because I'm worried, I don't drink because I'm dry.  
I know if I keep on drinkin', I'm liable to drink away my life.  
But that's alright.  
  
Baby, bring me another half-a-pint,  
I'm trying to drown these blues, yes I am.  
People if you had my trouble,  
Baby, I know you'd be drinkin' too.  
  
Alright.  
Baby, bring me some old Grandad's hundred proof.  
Don't play like that man, you'll make me thirsty.  
Oh, Lord.  
  
Baby, if I keep on drinkin', I know I can't last too long.  
Woman, if I keep on drinkin', people ya know I can't last too long.  
That's alright, cause when I'm dead and buried,  
Please think about me when you hear this song.

And now the gravity of trouble was more than I could bear,  
At times my luck was so bad, I had to fold my hands,  
Almost lost my soul, rarely I could find my head,  
Wake up early in the morning, feeling nearly dead.  
  
I was never afraid of danger, took trouble on the chin,  
Mountains I have climbed, that have killed a thousand men,  
Spent most of my lifetime downtown, sleepin' behind the wheel,  
Never needed anybody, I was king of the hill.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, when I think about the old days,  
Lord, it sends chills up and down my spine,  
Yeah life ain't what it seems, on the boulevard of broken dreams,  
Guess I opened my eyes in the nick of time,  
Cause it sure felt like the end of the line.  
  
No matter how hard I run, I just can't get away  
I try to do my best, but the devil gets in my way  
Spent most of my lifetime downtown, sleepin' behind the wheel  
'Till it all came down to kill or be killed  
  
[Chorus]

Famous last words, I'll be right back in a little while,  
I'll be home early, famous last words.  
Here comes the dawn, got to be headin' home in a little while,  
She'll be up singing along with the birds,  
Still believing famous last words.  
  
[Chorus]  
After all is said and done,  
You know that I would never do you no wrong,  
I never lied, never even tried,  
Even in famous last words.  
  
She sits there waiting, anticipating his return,  
There all alone, if only the phone would ring,  
Telling her only one thing, famous last words.  
  
[Chorus]

Firing Line  
I know you since you've been born  
Raising hell even as a child  
Nothing's change since that day  
You still are runnin' wild  
How hell I'm gonna tell you  
And closer barriers are passing by  
Well you left this state and running  
Is air too smooth these days  
I think it's time to come down  
you'll gonna have to mend your way  
Put your head up in the clouds  
Can not see through the haze  
  
Step outside Take a look around  
Do you see anyone who cares?  
Passed your whole life stepping on your friends  
Still your in nowhere  
Search for a new direction  
But the Past is all you'll find  
You can count upon your mistake  
Blame it on your criminal mind  
When you lay down your snakes  
Come up poisoned every time.

I went around to your house,  
Found you laid up in the bed,  
By early afternoon you were so sloppy drunk,  
You couldn't even raise up your head.  
  
So get on with your life baby,  
Please let me get on with mine.  
These days and your ways are so painful,  
You're just wasting all our precious time, ohhh.  
  
Since first I knew your name,  
I wasn't sure that you really cared.  
Spent most of your time with the other boys,  
And it's been all down hill from there.  
  
So get on with your life baby,  
Please let me get on with mine.  
Each day brings a new confusion,  
Another way to break this poor heart of mine.  
  
I can't begin to count the times that I've told ya,  
You better change all your wicked ways,  
But I'm real sure whatever the number,  
Ah it's the same as the times you laughed in my face.  
  
Won't somebody please wake me from this bad dream,  
I remember my grandmama told me,  
Things ain't always what they seem.  
  
So get on with your life baby,  
Please let me get on with mine.  
'Cause each day brings another confusion,  
It's about to break this poor heart of mine,  
Ohha, gonna lose my only mind, oh baby.  
Don't you break this poor heart of mine.

A man lay dying in the streets  
A thousand people fell down on their knees  
Any other day he would have been  
Preaching  
Reaching all the people there  
Oh Lord Lord  
  
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw  
I Say God Rest His Soul  
  
The Memphis battleground was red  
Cause blood came pouring from his head  
Women and children fallin' down  
Crying  
For the man they loved so well  
Oh Lord, Lord  
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw  
I say God rest his soul  
  
(I break here)  
  
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw  
I say God rest his soul  
  
The morning sun will rise again  
With all the passions growing thin  
What we gonna do when war is come and we're  
Dying  
Dying for the cause I know  
  
(Yeah but)  
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw  
Say God rest his soul

I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more  
I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more  
I know my health is failing me now  
I know I'm goin' down slow  
  
Won't somebody write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in  
I want somebody to writet my mother and tell her the shape I'm in  
I want you tell her to pray for me  
Ask her to forgive me for all my sins  
  
Mother please don't send me no doctor  
A doctor can't do me no good  
I don't want you to send me no doctor now  
A doctor just can't do me no good  
Back when I was a young boy oh  
I just didn't do the things I should  
  
Mmmm Mmmmmm  
Mmmm Mmmmmm

Well, I am on the prowl baby  
Looking for someone to satisfy my needs  
Some way, somehow  
I'm gonna find someone to spend some time with me  
I ain't looking out forever, for some woman to treat a good man right  
You look so good, you got me thinking  
You might satisfy my soul tonight  
There's no harm done, I know you're the one  
You don't got to worry, no hurry  
The night's still young  
I'm just looking for some good clean fun  
I am looking for one woman  
Ain't always tryin' to put me down  
I don't want nobody,  
Who's always givin' me that same old run around.  
I ain't leapin', I'm just leanin'  
Looking for that good kind thing  
I can tell by the way you're acting  
You know exactly what I mean  
There's no harm done, I know you're the one  
You don't got to worry, no hurry  
The night's still young  
I'm just looking for some good clean fun  
I better slow down, I don't want to move too soon  
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do  
Please don't think I am movin' in for the kill  
But if you don't want to love me somebody else will  
I better slow down, I don't want to move to soon  
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do  
Please don't think I am moving out for the kill  
If you don't want to love me somebody else will  
There's no harm done, I know you're the one  
You don't got to worry, no hurry  
The night is still young  
I'm just looking for some good clean fun  
Some good clean fun  
Oh baby! Just looking for some good clean fun

Awwwwww  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Since she left I've been running wild  
Jumping all the women I can  
Gave me some trouble for a little while  
But now I'm back to my old style  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Oh yes I am, and further more  
  
Ain't got no home, no children, no pets  
I'm a happily married man  
When I get tried I just lay down  
I sleep where ever I am  
Now my plate and my pot are gone from my sink  
And I don't have to worry bout taking a drink  
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
  
Come on in there you'all  
  
Whooa, now let me get in there  
  
Now my new old lady is outta sight  
I'm a happily married man  
She's a loving me a every day and a every night  
Just as much as she can  
Now I don't have to worry about sleeping pill  
Knives, Guns or doctor bill  
No I ain't seen my wife for two or three years  
I'm a happily married man  
Happily married man  
Parting with you was such a sweet sorrow  
Whooa, awww, come on

There've been so many girls that I have known  
I've made so many cry, yet I still wonder why  
Here comes a little girl, I see her walking down the street  
She's all by herself, I try to knock her off her feet  
But, she'll never break, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa this heart of stone darling  
  
What's different about her? I don't really know  
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry  
  
Well don't keep on looking, that same old way  
If you try acting sad, oh you'll only make me glad  
  
You better listen here little girl, you go on walking down the street  
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind you wanna meet  
'Cause you'll never, no, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa this heart of stone darling  
This heart of stone  
  
Oh you'll never break it baby  
No, this heart of stone  
No, never try and break it darling  
No, no, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa, whoa, this heart of stone  
This stone

You're the life of the party, everybody's host  
Still you need somewhere you can hide  
All your good time friends  
And your farewell to has-beens  
Lord knows, just along for the ride  
You think you're a survivor  
But boy, you better think twice  
No one rides for nothin'  
So, step up and pay the price  
It's a high cost of low livin'  
Ain't it high time? You turn yourself around  
Yeah, the high cost of low livin'  
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground  
So many here who love ya  
But still, you just can't tell  
Real ones and those who drop your name  
All the while behind your back  
They lift the flesh right from your bones  
You should know by now through all their game  
They've been chasing each dream with whiskey  
From here to Tokyo  
Usin' up all your real friends  
Places left to go  
It's a high cost of low livin'  
Ain't it high time? You turn yourself around  
Yeah, the high cost of low livin'  
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground  
Don't look behind you  
Ahh, don't look back  
Don't turn to find reason in the past  
Past is gone, gone at last  
And it's high cost of low livin'  
And it's high time you turn yourself around  
Well, the high cost of low livin'  
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground

Oh-uh-oh, oooh.  
I got a right to be wrong.  
I got a right to be lonely when you're gone.  
Whoa, I'll get out around, tear up my own home town.  
Get mocked up, locked up, wind up in the lost and found,  
Oh, I got a right to be wrong.  
Well it's so easy to give advice,  
When you ain't the one who got to pay the price.  
Sit up there on your hill telling me I got to sink or swim.  
Well it might thrill you, to make me want to kill ya,  
I can't believe you're leavin' me for him,  
I got a right to be wrong.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, loan me a dollar and watch me follow you around,  
You got all the moves, you're puttin' me through school.  
Oh, I give you my best, but I guess I'm still your fool,  
Babe, I got you down in my song.  
I got a right to be wrong.  
  
I've been con-flicted, e-victed, re-stricted,  
Served with a letter sent to whom it may concern,  
Still around Lord, I'm still in town,  
A lesson hard learned nearly got me down,  
It's a cryin' shame, you don't even know my name,  
A low down lonesome song,  
I got a right to be wrong.  
  
[Chorus]  
I got a right to be wrong.

Well I'm gonna move baby  
Well on the outskirts of town  
Well I'm gonna move baby, yeah  
Way back down on the outskirts of town, yeah  
  
Well I don't need nobody else  
Always hanging around  
Yeah yeah, baby, oh oh  
  
Well let me tell you baby  
We're gonna move away from here  
Well I don't need no ash mail  
To buy, Lord I'm gonna buy you a fridge dare  
  
Lord when we move  
Way back down on the outskirts of town, yeah yeah  
Well I don't need nobody else  
Ah, worse hanging around  
Oh, play your song, yeah  
  
Love me babe  
  
Yeah  
  
Well let me tell you, baby  
As funny as it seems  
We're gonna have a dozen children  
They're all, all gonna look like me  
Lord, when we move, yeah, way back down  
Way back down on the outskirts of town  
  
Well I don't need nobody, yeah  
Always hanging around  
Yeah yeah, no  
Yeah  
Y'all

No I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the street  
I've got my label  
So I won't crumble at your feet  
  
And I know baby  
So I've got scars upon my cheek  
And I'm half crazy  
Come on and love me baby  
  
So you find me hard to handle  
Well I'm easier to hold  
So you like my spurs that jingle  
And I never leave you cold  
So I might steal your diamonds  
I'll bring you back some gold  
  
I'm no angel, no I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the dark  
Let me rock your cradle  
Let me start a fire with your spark  
  
Oh come on baby  
Come and let me show you my tattoo  
Let me drive you crazy  
Come on and love me, baby  
  
So you don't give a darn about me  
I never treat you bad  
I won't ever lift a hand to hurt you  
And I'll always leave you glad  
So I might steal your diamonds  
I'll bring you back some gold  
I'm no angel  
  
No I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the dark  
Let me rock your cradle  
Let me start a fire in your heart  
  
Oh come on, baby  
Come and let me show you my tattoo  
Let me drive you crazy  
Come on and love me baby  
  
Oh come on, baby  
Drive me crazy  
Drive me crazy  
Oh come on, baby  
Oh come on, baby  
Oh come on, baby

Well, it's raining out the window.  
With no sadness on your face.  
As you're cleaning out your closet.  
Throw your clothes around the place.  
  
I can't stand to see you leaving.  
I'm not ashamed to beg you to stay.  
I can't lock the door and keep you.  
I won't stand in your way.  
  
Guess I've got to let you go.  
But there's just one thing you should know.  
  
It ain't over, it ain't over yet.  
You might walk away but you won't forget.  
I'll never stop loving you.  
My mind is set.  
So do what you gotta do yeah.  
Cause it ain't over yet.  
  
Guess I should have seen it coming.  
But I can see it clearly now.  
Gonna change my way of living.  
Try to get you back somehow.  
Some night when you're lonely.  
And your thoughts have turned to me.  
Just when you least expect it.  
I'll come walking through your dreams.  
  
So go on take that taxi ride.  
Cause I know time is on my side.  
  
It ain't over, it ain't over yet.  
You might walk away but you won't forget.  
I'll never stop loving you.  
My mind is set.  
Do what you gotta do baby.  
It ain't over...

Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I have not come, yeah  
To testify  
About our bad, bad misfortune  
And I ain't here a wond'rin' why  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
  
I sat down and wrote you a long letter  
It was just the other day  
Said, sure as the sunrise, baby  
Tomorrow I'll be up and on my way  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Oh no  
  
Oh, but I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Yes now baby  
  
But in the end, baby  
Long towards the end of your road  
Don't reach out for me, babe  
'Cause I'm not gonna carry your load  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Yeah, yeah  

Stormy stormy rain  
I'm as lonesome as a man can be  
Oh, it's stormin', stormin' rain and  
I'm as lonesome as a man can be.  
Whoa, the way you've been treatin' me,  
I realize it's not the same.  
  
It's a down-right rotten,  
Low down dirty shame  
Lord it's a down right rotten  
low down dirty shame  
The way that you treated me  
Lord I know I'm not to blame  
  
Jelly jelly jelly  
Jelly stains on my mind  
Jelly jelly jelly  
Jelly stays on my mind  
Jelly roll killed my pappy,  
And drove my mama stone blind.

You ride on down the same old street you've seen a thousand times,  
That overflows with neon lights and enormous signs.  
My God, how you want to leave there. Well, well.  
Your head severely poundin' from the night before.  
Baby, you just keep goin' back, goin' back for more.  
Cause midnight's callin'. Well, well.  
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm.  
But you can't find no place to grab on.  
So 'round and 'round you go again, and it just ain't easy.  
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm.  
But you can't find no place to grab on.  
So 'round and 'round you go again, and it just ain't easy.  
No, it just ain't easy.  
Lovely ladies all dressed in silk and lace.  
While you're there, oh, it seems like such a lovely place.  
But when you leave there,  
You got your hat down on your face. Well, well.  
But oh, when you leave there, got your hat down on your face, well, well.  
Ohh, when you leave there, you got your hat pulled down on your face, well.  
(repeat and fade)

Sit alone, waiting on the morning  
Woman leaving her whole life behind  
train rolling on, taking mama's baby home  
no one knows what's going through her mind  
  
Just another love song I'm singing  
And you know people sing them all of the time  
Just another lonesome guitar ringing  
The only difference is this one is mine  
  
Freedom, Lord what a funny word  
We search for it just like some kind of fool  
Woman leaving home, man sit's there all alone  
Little child is paying all the dues

Tried everything I know,  
Held my hand but now I've got to show.  
Trying to understand the things you've learned,  
But you don't seem to be concerned at all.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna keep on keepin' on,  
Ain't gonna leave you alone,  
Keep on keepin' on,  
  
Ain't gonna leave you alone,  
Gonna get you to love me.  
Sometimes it seems like there's just no way at all,  
You just keep drifting and drifting away.  
  
You ain't never home, when I call you on the telephone,  
But I'm gonna fool around, get you back someday.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't care what everybody's gotta say,  
I'm gonna love you anyway,  
Even if you don't care any longer,  
My little bit of love keeps getting stronger.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord I'm gonna, keep on keepin' on.  
Gonna, make you mine. Love me... yeah.

What'll you do when you get lonely  
And nobody's waiting by your side?  
You've been running and hiding much too long.  
You know it's just your foolish pride.  
  
[Chorus]  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
I tried to give you consolation  
When your old man had let you down.  
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,  
Turned my whole world upside down.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
Let's make the best of the situation  
Before I finally go insane.  
Please don't say I'll never find a way  
And tell me all my love's in vain.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Pocket full of money  
Got a big smile all on my face  
Boy and I can charm the diamonds  
right off the back of a rattlesnake  
  
But you've got me so confused  
Cut me cold as ice  
I ain't used to losing  
Guess I'm playing with loaded dice  
  
Well the first time that I saw you  
Said you'd just dumped your old man  
Then the next time you was dealin'  
Must have dealt me a losing hand  
Woman I tried to win your love  
Just can't pay the price  
Keep throwing in sevens  
I keep on playing with loaded dice  
  
Well I thought I was a hustler  
But you sent me back to school  
Keep playing some new game  
Making up your own rules  
Must be some kind of crazy  
let you fool me twice  
I don't know why  
I keep playing with loaded dice  
  
Well, tonight I hit the jackpot  
I was shining like a diamond ring  
Lady luck was smiling  
And the old snake charmer was doing his thing  
  
You saw the tables turn  
man it sure felt nice  
Now we see who's laughing  
Now we see who's playing with the loaded dice  
  
Girl you ain't like nothing  
I've ever seen before  
Keep throwing in aces  
I keep coming back for more  
Guess I should have listened  
But you can't give a fool advice  
Don't know why I keep playing with loaded dice

Out on the lonesome highway  
Suitcase and an old guitar  
Just outside Oklahoma City  
Place called Johnny's Roadside Bar  
  
Having fun, son of a gun  
I ain't fit to be tied  
I'm on my way back to Georgia  
Won't you give me a ride  
  
Sometimes it at easy  
When you don't have much to spare  
Traveling light, Lord, counting on my fifth  
But the little bit hear and there  
  
She's got the prettiest big brown eyes  
When she's satisfied  
But I'm on way back to Georgia, boys  
Won't you give me a ride  
  
I'm a long time gone  
On my way back home, Lord  
Long time gone, gone  
  
I'm a long time gone  
On my way back home, Lord  
Long time gone, gone  
  
I'm a long time gone  
On my way back home, Lord  
Long time gone, gone

[Chorus]  
Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John,  
Oh lord, what a natural pair.  
Looking for a game, fortune and fame,  
Waitin' just a little farther down the road somewhere.  
  
Now Three Card Monty is a gamblin' game,  
Two black aces and a pretty red queen,  
Keep your eye on the lady and lay your money down,  
Watch the fastest hand you've ever seen.  
  
Texas Hustlin' Billy, lord he's on the road again,  
He was seen in New Orleans the other day,  
Now Lou is known as quite a man with a pool cue in his hand,  
Won't be long 'til him and John were headed down that way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was Friday night, lord the time was right,  
Texas Billy finally made his play,  
The game went on into the night and just about dawn,  
They were counting Bill's money lord, headed for LA  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waitin' just a little farther down the road somewhere

[Chorus]  
Ain't that low down, low down dirty mean  
The way you've been treatin' me,  
Beats all I've ever seen.  
  
I loaned you my brand new car,  
Said you was goin' for a Sunday drive,  
Yeah, here it is now four days later,  
I don't know if you are dead or alive,  
  
I got on the telephone this morning,  
Put the word out on the street,  
And I heard you was down in Memphis,  
With a big man in the driver's seat.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got me a hidin' in the bushes,  
Peekin' in the window pane,  
Shadow moves along the wall,  
I know you're in there with another man,  
  
Tried to get in the front door,  
Went around to the back door too,  
I believe you've got a side track man in there,  
Making my sweet love to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Makin' my last proclamation,  
Gonna lay it on the line,  
Baby I'm runnin' out of patience,  
And you are runnin' out of time,  
  
Tired of all of your mean things,  
And all your dirty tricks,  
If I ever turn on you baby,  
You're gonna be in some kind of fix.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah so low down, I know, low down dirty mean, ah!

I will never forget the time we spent together  
And let the whole wide world go by  
I can't forget the dreams that we made come true  
As the clouds in the sky rolled on  
  
And I can't forget the day we met  
Oh our love came so easy  
It's so hard for me to say  
That we can never go back to yesterday  
  
You must know that it don't happen everyday  
Now I see that I let love slip through my fingers  
Someone said that love is just a beautiful dream  
And let it drift away  
  
Oh another lonely teardrop  
Just one more careless love  
It's so hard for me to say  
That we can never go back to yesterday  
  
Baby let's fall in love again  
Baby let's fall in love  
Baby let's fall in love again  
And maybe we can go back to yesterday

Fatal beauty, the chokin' kind  
Dangerous feeling in this heart of mine  
How can you love me  
And treat me so unkind  
You got me floppin' like a fish in a pan  
Ain't no way to treat your man  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell, Maydell  
  
Fire spreads quick through the neighborhood  
Talk is cheap when the story's good  
Nobody said you did, but everybody said that you would  
You got me feelin' like a dog, chasin' his tail  
I know I'll never catch you - you play the game too well  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell, Maydell  
  
Every time I try to walk away,  
Just walk away  
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,  
Honey won't you stay  
Ruby red lips, callin' my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
Maydell  
  
Well every time I try to walk away,  
Ooo just walk away  
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,  
Honey won't you stay  
Ruby red lips, callin' my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell  
Can't break the spell  
Can't break the spell, Maydell  
Ohhh  
Ohh babe

Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah.  
The gypsy flies from coast to coast,  
Knowing many, loving none,  
Bearing sorrow, having fun.  
But, back home he'll always run,  
To sweet Melissa.  
Mmmm-hmmm.  
  
Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same.  
And no one knows the gypsy's name,  
And no one hears his lonely sighs,  
There are no blankets where he lies.  
Lord, in his deepest dreams the gypsy flies,  
With sweet Melissa.  
Mmmm-hmmm.  
  
Again, the mornin's come.  
Again, he's on the run.  
A sunbeam's shinin through his hair.  
Appearing not to have a care.  
Well, pick up your gear and gypsy roll on.  
Roll on.  
  
Crossroads, will you ever let him go? Lord, Lord.  
Or will you hide the dead man's ghost?  
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?  
Or will his spirit float away?  
But, I know that he won't stay,  
Without Melissa.  
Yes, I know that he won't stay, yeah,  
Without Melissa.  
Lord, Lord, it's all the same.  
Mmmmm-hmmmmm.

Got my snake skin britches, alligator shoes,  
Money in my pocket, and a Memphis attitude.  
Wear my downtown Stetson with a silver on the crown,  
When I get started rolling baby, there ain't no slowin me down.  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man and I love you till the daylight babe.  
Got my six shooter, gonna shoot it up in the air,  
If it feels real good, I might shoot it just everywhere.  
Got my best mojo, and my hoochie coochie too,  
Gonna put it all together gonna get after you  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man and I love you till the daylight babe.  
One thing's for certain since I been foolin' with you,  
My reputation's hurtin' and I don't know what to do.  
All of my little downtown girls, say I'm wasting time,  
There ain't no use to fight it, I just can't get you outta my mind.  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man, and I love you till the daylight babe.  
Hey, midnight, midnight man.

Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding,  
And I'm bound to keep on riding.  
And I've got one more silver dollar,  
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no,  
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.  
  
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing,  
And the road goes on forever,  
And I've got one more silver dollar,  
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.  
  
And I've gone by the point of caring,  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing,  
And I've got one more silver dollar,  
  
Repeat three times and Fade  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.

Got on a bus in Memphis,  
Destination Rome.  
Georgia ain't no paradise  
But a place I just call home.  
I sat next to a broken hearted bride  
She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide  
Her selfish sorrow.  
  
I tried to get her talkin'  
She didn't have much to say  
She asked me for a map to death row  
But I didn't know the way  
She had lost a million in the game  
One look out the window at the pine trees and the rain  
It wasn't her day.  
  
Multicolored lady  
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen  
Multicolored lady  
Angry red, passion blue, but mostly shades of green  
  
Midnight came and brought more rain,  
Nothing seemed to ease her pain.  
The hours that we talked seemed like minutes all in vein.  
I watched as her tears kept runnin' wide  
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while  
She started smilin'.  
  
Multicolored lady  
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known.  
Multicolored lady  
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home  
  
Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome.

Everybody wanna know  
Where Jimmy has gone  
He left town  
I doubt if he's comin' back home  
Tony gotta job  
Three kids and a lovely wife  
Workin' in the commerce bank  
For the rest of his life  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
I'm gonna hit the road  
Adios my friend  
Go some place  
And start all over again  
Don't know where I'm goin'  
Like a gypsy out on the road  
Go some place and join a travelin' show  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
I think Jimmy must've had the right idea  
He packed his stuff  
And he got right out of here  
I don't know where he's at  
But I'm sure that he's ok  
Now I realize  
What Jimmy was tryin' to say  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
No no nobody left to run with anymore  

Nobody knows about what's going on,  
With the world and the steel,  
The flesh and the bone.  
River keeps flowing and the grass still grows,  
And the spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Poets they come and the poets they go,  
Politicians and preachers they all claim to know.  
The words that are written and the melody's played,  
As the years turn their pages, they all start to fade.  
The oceans still move with the moon and the sky,  
The grass still grows on the hillside.  
Got to believe in believing,  
Got to believe in a dream,  
Freedom is ever deceiving,  
Never turning out to be what it seems.  
It's amazing how fast our lives go by,  
Like the flash of the lightning or the blink of an eye.  
We all fall in love, and we fall into life,  
We look for the truth on the edge of a knife.  
Heavens turn around the river still flows,  
Spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Words that are written and melody's played,  
As the years turn their pages, it all start to fade.  
Oceans still move with the moon and the sky,  
The grass still grows on the hillside.  
Got to believe in believing,  
Got to believe in a dream,  
Freedom is ever deceiving,  
Never turning out to be what it seems.

Our lives are hanging in the balance  
Or they're dangling by a thread  
A spark of life brought down from an angel  
To raise the stranger from the dead  
Once more we're cheating on the reaper  
With all the gypsy in our souls  
Cause I know there's a God up in heaven  
Who must love rock and roll  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
As the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale  
  
And here's to the you for always hangin' in  
Without you there's no reason to go  
I'd be lying face down in some river  
Waiting on an angel to take me back home  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
With the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale  
  
Solo:  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
With the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale

By (D. Allman)  
  
Upon my word what does it mean  
Is it love or is it me  
That makes me change so suddenly  
From looking out to feeling free  
  
I sit here lying in my bed  
Wondering what it was I said  
That made me think I'd lost my head  
When I knew I lost my heart instead  
  
Chorus:  
  
So won't you please read my signs be a gypsy  
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me  
And because you can't find my mind please be with me  
  
And of all the better things I've heard  
Loving you has made the words  
And all the rest seem so absurd  
Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure  
  
Chorus:  
  
So won't you please read my signs be a gypsy  
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me  
And because you can't find my mind please be with me

Take one last look, before you leave,  
'Cause oh, somehow it means so much to me.  
And if you'll ever need me, you know where I'll be.  
So, please, call home if ya change your mind.  
Oh, I don't mind.  
  
I guess I saw it comin' day by day.  
But, oh, I could not stand the failure.  
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say,  
Please, call home if ya change your mind.  
Oh, I don't mind.  
  
And I know, you're used to runnin'.  
Oh, you're lost baby, and I ain't funnin'.  
But, oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come runnin',  
Straight to your side, again I'll confide in you.  
  
So, go on, I won't say no more.  
My heart ain't in it, but I'll hold the door.  
But, just remember what I said before.  
Please, call home if ya change your mind.  
Please, call home if ya change your mind.  
Oh yeah, call home if ya change your mind.  
Call home if ya change your mind, oh.  
Please, call home if ya change your mind.  
Oh yeah, call home baby.  
Mmm-hmm

When the rain comes,  
They run and hide their head,  
Might as well be dead,  
When the rain comes,  
When the rain comes.  
  
When the sun shines,  
They slip into the shade,  
Drink their lemonade,  
When the sun shines,  
When the sun shines.  
  
Rain, I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Shine, the weather is fine.  
  
I can show you,  
When I starts to rain,  
Everything's gonna be the same, yeah,  
I can show you, I can show you.  
  
Rain, I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Shine, the weather is fine.

[Chorus]  
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man,  
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can.  
And when it's time for leavin',  
I hope you'll understand,  
That I was born a ramblin' man.  
  
Well my father was a gambler down in Georgia,  
He wound up on the wrong end of a gun.  
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus  
Rollin' down highway 41.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin',  
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee,  
They're always having a good time down on the bayou,  
Lord, them Delta women think the world of me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you hear it? Love is in the air.  
We're in a revolution. Don't you know we're right.  
Everyone is singing. Yeah! There'll be no one to fight.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
Love is everywhere.  
Love is everywhere.  
Love is everywhere.  
Love is everywhere.  
Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.  
People can you feel it? Love is everywhere.

"My gaurdian angel wears a hard hat,"  
Said the boy with the microphone  
"Else, I wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little young a boy  
I couldn't leave well enough alone  
When trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
  
Hard living be the death of me  
Yes gonna lead me to an early grave  
To die in the saddle must be my destiny  
But to ride this rocking horse I must be crazed  
  
Good clean fun is just my imagination  
Down and dirty that's the way the game is played  
This hard life has caused me aggravation  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh no now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Ohh I gotta ride that rocking horse  
  
Talking, about my guardian angel, she wears a hard hat  
Wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little bitty young boy  
Been trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh now now now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Gotta ride my rockin' horse

Seven turns on the highway,  
Seven rivers to cross.  
Sometimes, you feel like you could fly away,  
Sometimes, you get lost.  
  
And sometimes, in the darkened night,  
You see the crossroad sign.  
One way is the mornin' light,  
You got to make up your mind.  
  
Somebody's callin' your name.  
Somebody's waiting for you.  
Love is all that remains the same,  
That's what it's all comin' to.  
Hey, yeah.  
  
Runnin' wild out on the road,  
Just like a leaf on the wind.  
How in the world could you ever know,  
We'd ever meet again?  
  
Seven turns on the highway,  
Seven rivers to cross.  
Sometimes, you feel like you could fly away,  
Sometimes, you get lost.  
  
Somebody's callin' your name.  
Somebody's waitin' for you.  
Love is all that remains the same,  
That's what it's all comin' to.  
  
Somebody's callin' your name.  
Somebody's waitin' for you.  
Love is all that remains the same,  
That's what it's all comin to.  
  
Somebody's callin' your name.  
Somebody's waitin' for you.  
Somebody's callin' your name.  
That's what it's all coming to.

Verse 1:  
Shapes  
Of things before my eyes  
Just teach me to despise  
Will time make man more wise  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Here  
Within my lonely frame  
My eyes just hurt my brain  
But will they seem the same  
  
Chorus:  
Come tomorrow  
Will I be older  
Come tomorrow  
May be a soldier  
Come tomorrow  
Will I be bolder  
Than today?  
  
Verse 3:  
  
Now  
The trees are almost green  
But will they still be seen  
Where time and tide have been  
  
Verse 4:  
  
Fallen  
Into your passing hands  
Please don't destroy these lands  
Don't make them desert sands  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
Guitar solo:  
  
Verse 5:  
  
Soon  
I hope that I will find  
Loves deep within my mind  
That won't disgrace my kind

Every day I try so hard to know your mind  
And find out what's inside you  
Time goes on and I don't know just who you are  
Or how I'm going to find you  
  
You can do whatever you please  
The world's waiting to be seized  
You can collect all neglect  
Or all the self-respect you need, what you need  
  
And I know... And I know... And I know  
  
Your mind's guaranteed  
It's all you'll ever need  
So what do you want with me?  
  
We live but once  
But good things can be found around  
In spite of all the sorrow  
  
If you see black  
You can't look back  
You can't look front  
You cannot face tomorrow  
  
Some have it nice  
Fat and round, flash, paradise  
They're very wise to their disguise  
Trying to revolutionize tomorrow  
  
And I know... And I know... And I know  
  
Your mind's guaranteed  
It's all you'll ever need  
So what do you want with me

So long, I hope our paths meet again some day.  
Oh, but who's to say, who's to say, where or when?  
And I'll be hopin' that it'll be real, real soon.  
Yeah, I'll be hopin' that you'll be there sharin'  
My little cozy bedroom.  
We've been together down that long and lonesome road.  
The happiness we've shared was through each other  
And it's a doggone shame such a beautiful thing,  
Should have to fade away,  
Not too many people ever had what we had,  
To throw it all away is oh, so sad. So long, so long.  
So long. I believe our paths may cross again.  
And I thank the Lord, thank the Lord,  
that this time we parted friends.  
So for this time, so long, so long, so long, so long.

When you can't find the light,  
That got you through the cloudy days,  
When the stars ain't shinin' bright,  
You feel like you've lost you're way,  
When those candle lights of home,  
Burn so very far away,  
Well you got to let your soul shine,  
Just like my daddy used to say.  
  
He used to say soulshine,  
It's better than sunshine,  
It's better than moonshine,  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Hey now people don't mind,  
We all get this way sometime,  
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  
  
I grew up thinkin' that I had it made,  
Gonna make it on my own.  
Life can take the strongest man,  
Make him feel so alone.  
Now and then I feel a cold wind,  
Blowin' through my achin' bones,  
I think back to what my daddy said,  
He said "Boy, in the darkness before the dawn:"  
  
Let your soul shine,  
It's better than sunshine,  
It's better than moonshine,  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Yeah now people don't mind,  
We all get this way sometimes,  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  
  
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness,  
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.  
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this.  
And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control.  
  
Let your soul shine,  
It's better than sunshine,  
It's better than moonshine,  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Lord now people don't mind,  
We all get this way sometimes,  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.  
  
Oh, it's better than sunshine,  
It's better than moonshine,  
Damn sure better than rain.  
Yeah now people don't mind,  
We all get this way sometimes,  
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.

Well I'm Southbound, Lord I'm comin' home to you.  
Well I'm Southbound, baby, Lord I'm comin' home to you.  
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues.  
  
Well I been workin' every night, travelin' every day.  
Yes I been workin' every night, traveling every day.  
You can tell your other man, sweet daddy's on his way.  
Aww, ya better believe.  
  
Well I'm Southbound.  
Whoa I'm Southbound.  
Well you can tell your other man, Sweet daddy's on his way.  
  
Got your hands full now baby, as soon as I hit that door.  
You'll have your hands full now woman, just as soon as I hit that door.  
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should have  
Had before.  
  
Lord, I'm Southbound.  
Yes I'm Southbound.  
Whoa I'm Southbound, baby.  
Said I'm Southbound.  
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should  
Have had before.

Could be spoonful of diamonds  
Could be spoonful of gold  
But I want a spoon ot your precious love  
To satisfy my soul  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful  
  
Could be spoonful of coffee  
Could be spoonful of tea  
But I want a spoon of your precious love  
That's good enough for me  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful  
.  
Could be a spoonful of water  
Searching from the desert sand  
But just a spoon of that fortifies  
Saved you from another man  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful  
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

I recall once upon a time,  
Livin was so easy and I felt so fine.  
But, my, my, my right before my very eyes,  
Satan came with fire to burn me,  
Wouldn't listen when they warned me.  
A dagger in my back while she's calling me honey,  
Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.  
  
Thirty minutes after my ship set sail,  
She put up a sign and my house began to wail.  
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?  
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.  
And I would ask the woman, "Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?  
You ain't gonna rule me."  
  
Just when all began to fade,  
I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.  
I put her on a train to the Everglades.  
  
Now that it's all over and gone,  
Somehow I just don't feel so alone.  
But, lie, lie, lie it seemed like such a waste of time.  
She did not ever seem to know me,  
But, now it's much too late to show me.  
But, if I ever see that woman walkin down the street I'll just stand back,  
And try to move away slowly.  
Oh, yeah.

They call it Stormy Monday  
But Tuesday's just as bad.  
They call it Stormy Monday  
But Tuesday's just as bad.  
Lord, and Wednesday's worse  
And Thursday's all so bad.  
  
The eagle flies on Friday,  
Saturday I go out to play.  
The eagle flies on Friday,  
Saturday I go out to play.  
Sunday I go to church,  
Gonna kneel down and pray.  
  
Lord have mercy,  
Lord have mercy on me.  
Lord have mercy,  
Lord have mercy on me.  
Though I'm tryin' and tryin' to find my baby,  
Won't someone please send her home to me.

Sweet mama, lay your burden down,  
Sweet mama, lay your burden down,  
Just let me tell you 'bout some truth in life I've found,  
Sweet mama, lord. set yourself right down.  
  
Lord, pride, it ain't worth a US dime, lord no,  
Well pride, it ain't worth a poor man's time  
And it's misery to be so jealous all the time  
Sweet mama, lord, be kind to your mind.  
  
Sweet mama, lay your burden down,  
Oh sweet mama, lord lay them trophies down,  
You know it ain't no good to be givin' me that same old run-around,  
'Cause sweet mama, lay your burden down.  
  
Sweet mama, lord, you're so feelin' fine  
And I know that you think this is just a line,  
But I only put these words into this little song,  
To try, lord, and help us get along.

Like the hopeful dreams of many, he had everything and more,  
A lovely wife and children, all the things worth fighting for.  
He knows, there was still, still, something missing in his life.  
Though he promised to be faithful, he was good at telling lies.  
He had an eye for young girls, he would steal some on the side.  
Oh no, he just could not be satisfied.  
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run,  
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun.  
He met her at a night club, on the other side of town.  
Somehow he could not resist her, she's the best he'd ever found.  
She knows, she found her ticket to the other side.  
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run,  
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun.  
His foolish ways seem harmless, but his world was so divine,  
Cause at home they know his secrets, they've heard all his alibis.  
As he tries to face his feelings, he can't justify his crimes,  
Now comes the final ending, of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside.  
He can kiss it all good-bye.  
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run,  
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun.  
Oh, umm, ya baby, ahh temptation is a gun.  
Temptation is a gun, All or nothing, all or nothing.

The words are the thunder  
The thought is the lightning  
The telling of the tale is the storm  
The defendant must be guilty  
As he waits impatiently  
As the wooden stake is driven  
And the angel sounds the horn  
  
The cornered Lion is not within the realm of reason  
Fear is like the cracking of the lash  
You want to run, you want to fight  
Lightning flashes in the night  
You finally turn away to hide your face  
As the judges file in to take their places  
  
You got to hold your ground  
Hold your ground like a man  
Sometimes you've just got to hold your ground  
When the truth has finally been tasted  
You can tell them all their time has not been wasted  
  
You got to hold your ground  
Hold your ground like a man  
Sometimes you've just got to hold your ground  
When the truth has finally been tasted  
You can tell them all their time has not been wasted

Make a man go crazy, a woman wear her dress so tight  
Must be the same thing make a tom cat fight all night.  
Make you feel so good when your baby get her evening gown

Must be the same thing make a preacher lay his bible down.  
Woah that same thing,  
Woah that same thing,  
Tell me who is to blame,  
Whole world fighting about that same thing.  
What makes all these men chase a big leg woman down,

Must be the same thing make a poor dog a hurtin' hound.  
Woah that same thing,

Whole world fighting about that same thing.  
Oh that same thing,  
Woah that same thing,  
Tell me who is to blame,  
Whole world fighting about that same thing.

Chorus

Don't care how long you go,  
I don't care how long you stay,  
It's good kind treatment,  
Bring you home someday.  
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,  
Poor me, anymore.  
Now you keep on bettin',  
That the dice won't pass.  
Well I know, and I know,  
Whoa, oh you're livin' too fast.  
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,  
Poor me, anymore.  
Yeah, I'll tell everybody,  
In my neighborhood.  
You're a kind little woman,  
But you don't do me no good.  
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,  
Poor me, anymore.  
I know you're leaving,  
If you call that's gone.  
Oh without my lovin' yeah,  
Oh, you can't stay long.  
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,  
Poor me, anymore.  
Well good bye baby,  
Yeah well take my hand.  
I don't want no woman no,  
Who can't have no man.  
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,  
Poor me, anymore. Trouble no more.  
Oh yeah yeah babe.

Well I just can't believe it's time for leavin',  
Even though I've been deceivin' you,  
Guess I guessed that I've been through it wrong again, baby,  
Though I remember when I fell in love with you.  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.  
After all this time we've been together,  
It just ain't right to throw it all away,  
Yes I know we have seen some stormy weather,  
Though I know tomorrow's gonna be a brand new day.  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.

Can you tell me, tell me, friend, just exactly where I've been?  
Is that so much to ask? I'll pay you back no matter what the task.  
You seem really sure 'bout something I don't know,  
take that load off, looks like chest's about to go.  
Your wasted words already been heard, are you really God, yes or no?  
  
Well, all day and half the night you're walkin' round lookin' such a fright.  
Is it me or is it you? I'd make a wager and I'd hope you lose.  
Time's gone, looks like Rome is 'bout to fall,  
Next time take the elevator, please don't crawl.  
Your wasted words so absurd, are you really Satan, yes or no?  
  
Well, I ain't no saint and you sure as hell ain't no savior,  
Every other Christmas I would practice good behavior.  
That was then, this is now, don't ask me to be Mister Clean,  
'cause baby, I don't know how.  
Ring my phone 'bout ten more times, we will see,  
find that broke down line and let it be.  
Your wasted words will never be heard, go on home baby and watch it on TV.  
  
Weekday soap-box specialty, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout now,  
By the way, this song's for you, sincerely, me.

I couldn't stay around and finish High School  
I had to hit the streets as soon as I could  
Now I'm running, always running  
As I turned out the way they said I would  
  
Daddy told me all about chasing women  
Watched my Momma lose her mind and all her hope  
Now the only thing that's left of my pathetic life  
Is dangling at the end of a rope  
What's done is done  
  
Had me way too much fun  
Now I'm running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
What's done is done  
Lord, what's done is done  
  
Started hanging with the wrong kind of people  
Fooling with the wrong kind of folks  
Made my living doing things, got me locked up in chains  
As I went the way they said I'd go  
  
Ahhh, what's done is done  
Had me way too much fun  
Now I'm running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
  
What's done is done  
Had me way to much fun  
Ohhh, running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
What's done is done  
  
Oh what's done is done  
Hey, ya, done is done  
ohh what's done is done

I've been run down and I've been lied to.  
And I don't know why, I let that mean woman make me a fool.  
She took all my money, wrecks my new car.  
Now she's with one of my good time buddies,  
They're drinkin in some cross-town bar.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.  
  
My friends tell me, that I've been such a fool.  
But I had to stand by and take it baby, all for lovin' you.  
Drown myself in sorrow as I look at what you've done.  
But nothing seemed to change, the bad times stayed the same,  
And I can't run.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.

Woke up this morning  
Something robbed me of my sleep  
Reached for you but all I felt  
Was a cold, empty sheet  
Three nights on the road, babe  
I don't know where you been  
Say you're working late  
Could it be you got another man?  
Somebody said they saw you  
In a little club downtown  
Arms around a stranger  
You were really goin' to town  
You say they're just jealous  
That you'll always be mine  
Nighttime has a thousand eyes  
Could they all be blind?  
Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?  
'Cause this confusion, oh, it's killing me  
They all say that you're doing me wrong  
But our love is much too strong  
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me  
Who to believe  
Baby, I really need you  
Though I love you like a child  
But I won't have no cheatin' woman  
Tellin' lies and runnin' wild  
I really want to believe you  
When you say that you're bein' true  
But everywhere I look  
Like the finger points to you  
Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?  
'Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that you're doing me bad  
You're the best thing I've ever had  
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me  
Who to believe  
Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?  
'Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that you're doing me wrong  
But our love is much too strong  
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me  
Am I a fool? Am I a fool?  
'Cause this confusion always killing me  
They all say that you're doing me bad  
You're the best thing I've ever had  
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me  
Who to believe  

Lying here for hours  
Can't get my eyes to close  
Can't get one moment's peace  
To save my dog-gone soul  
I've been doin' more than drinkin'  
Tryin' to ease my pain  
Everywhere I go  
Somebody speaks your name  
Oh my friends keep on askin'  
Boy what's wrong with you?  
I say I'm worried  
Worried down with the blues  
Try to be a good man  
Work my fingers to the bone  
And you return the favor  
By messing up my happy home  
You played so many dirty tricks  
Till I lost my faith in you  
Now you want me to take you back  
What's a poor man supposed to do?  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, I feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues  
You made me turn my back  
On my very best friend  
And when my back was turned  
You were messin' around with him  
I'd give up everything  
To have you by my side  
'Cause in the cold, cold night when I reach for you  
I'm holdin' to my foolish pride  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues, oh yeah
