Words and music by roger taylor  
They were talking in whispers  
In bear skins and fur  
Captain scott and his heroes to be  
To have laboured so long  
To have made it this far  
Ooh it's been such a long ride  
Ooh you know it's been a long way  
For a human human human  
For a human body you see  
Can you believe it happens?  
Now it happens here  
Do you believe do you believe or really care  
Can you believe it happens?  
Now it happens here  
To a human human  
With a human body you see  
There ain't nobody gets out of this moonlight  
Today is surprisingly fair  
Oh oh oh oh woo woo  
We've got problems the lone ranger can't fix  
The invisible man couldn't see  
It takes a tough guy  
To learn some new tricks  
Ooh it takes such a long time  
Ooh it's been such a long way  
For a human human human  
For a human body you see  
Can you believe it happens?  
Now it happens here  
Do you believe do you believe or really care  
Can you believe it happens?  
Now it happens here  
To a human human  
With a human body you see  
You know it's been such a long while  
It's been such a long while  
Takes such a long time  
It takes such a long time  
It's been such a long way  
Been such a long way  
It's been such a long while  
Been such a long while  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
It's gonna be a long ride  

It's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
A kind of magic - no way  
One dream, one soul, one prize  
One goal, one golden glance of what should be  
It's a kind of magic  
One shaft of light that shows the way  
No mortal man can win this day  
It's a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
It's a kind of magic  
The waiting seems eternity  
The day will dawn of sanity  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Is this a kind of magic?  
It's a kind of magic  
There can be only one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done  
This flame that burns inside of me  
I'm hearing secret harmonies  
It's a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
It's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done  
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)  
There can be only one one one one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done - done  
Magic - it's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
Magic magic magic (magic)  
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic  
Ha haa  
Yeah yeah  
Wooh  
It's a kind of magic

It's winter-fall  
Read skies are gleaming, oh  
Sea-gulls are flyin' over  
Swans are floatin' by  
Smoking chimney-tops  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
  
The nights draw in  
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah  
Children are fantasizing  
Grown-ups are standin' by  
What a super feeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
Woh-woh-woh-woh  
  
(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful  
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful  
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air  
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view  
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene  
With the dreams of the world  
In the palm of your hand  
  
(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat  
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that  
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by  
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face  
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!  
And the dream of the child  
Is the hope of the, hope of the man  
  
It's all so beautiful  
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah  
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh  
Little girls scream an' cry  
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'  
It's unbelievable  
Sends me reeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
  
Oooh - it's bliss  

Action  
  
This street honey is a mean street  
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak  
We've got criminals living in this street  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping  
Like a juke box playing the same dead record  
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring  
I got a feeling this world is using me  
  
This town honey is a dead town  
Living in this town honey is a let down  
Coming to this town honey is a show down  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray  
Through a crack in the shutter  
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel  
Still there's a feeling this world is using me  
  
Action this day action this night  
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
Action this day action this night  
Oh you've got the power you've got the power  
You've got the power to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
  
Your mind honey is a bleak place  
Living in your minds living in a blank space  
Your mind is coming from a rat race  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping  
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record  
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring  
I got a feeling that just won't quit  
This world is using me  
  
Action this day action this night  
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live  
We can't say it ain't right  
Action this day action this night  
Oh you've got the power you've got the power  
You've got the power to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
  
Action action this day  
Action this day  
Action action this day  
Action this day  
Living in the street  
Action

She came without a farthing  
A babe without a name  
So much ado 'bout nothing  
Is what she'd try to say  
So much ado my lover  
So many games we played  
Through every fleeted summer  
Through every precious day  
  
All dead, all dead  
All the dreams we had  
And I wonder why I still live on  
All dead, all dead  
And alone I'm spared  
My sweeter half instead  
All dead  
And gone  
All dead...  
  
All dead, all dead  
At the rainbow's end  
And still I hear her own sweet song  
All dead, all dead  
Take me back again  
You know my little friend's  
All dead  
And gone  
  
Her ways are always with me  
I wander all the while  
But please you must forgive me  
I am old but still a child  
  
All dead, all dead  
But I should not grieve  
In time it comes to everyone  
All dead, all dead  
But in hope I breathe  
Of course I don't believe  
You're dead  
And gone  
All dead  
And gone.

So all you people give freely  
Make welcome inside your homes, (ooh) ooh  
Thank God you people give freely (yeah)  
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord  
All prime ministers (yeah) and majesty around the world, yeah  
Open your eyes, look, touch and feel  
Rule with your heart (rule with your heart)  
Live with your conscience (live with your conscience)  
Love, love and be free  
Love, love and be free  
We're all God's people  
Gotta face up  
Better grow up  
Gotta stand tall and be strong  
Gotta face up  
Better grow up  
Gotta face up  
Better grow up  
Gotta stand tall and be strong  
Gotta face up  
Better grow up  
We're all God's people  
Gotta face up  
Better grow up  
Yeah yeah - yes there was this magic light  
I said to myself  
I'd better go to bed and have an early night  
Then I, then I, then I, then I went into a dream  
Rule with your heart and live with your conscience  
We're all God's people, yeah, give freely, yeah  
Make welcome inside your homes  
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible  
We're all God's people

She won our hearts the arts she loved  
Is painting pictures for free  
When she was done she hung them up  
For all the children to see  
  
[Chorus:]  
Goodbye April lady  
It's been good to have you around  
Goodbye April lady  
You've done a lot for the folks in this town  
  
The children learned to read  
She strung their beads  
It's sorry she was the one  
As you can see isn't she good  
She don't leave nothing undone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She taught them all to love  
She was their cream  
And we don't want her to go  
But we know too well  
She fell in love  
And there's no stopping her so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodbye April lady.

I had this perfect dream  
Un sueno me envolvio  
This dream was me and you  
Tal vez esta aqui  
I want all the world to see  
Un instinto me guiaba  
A miracle sensation  
My guide and inspiration  
Now my dream is slowly coming true  
The wind is a gentle breeze  
EI me hablo de ti  
The bells are ringing out  
EI canto vuela  
They're calling us together  
Guiding us forever  
Wish my dream would never go away  
  
Barcelona  
It was the first time that we met  
Barcelona  
How can I forget  
The moment that you stepped into the room  
You took my breath away  
  
Barcelona

Yella nos unio  
And if God is willing  
We will meet again  
Someday

Nace un gran amor  
Start the celebration

Come alive  
Vive  
And shake the foundations from the skies  
Shaking all our lives

Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar

Caught in a landslide  
No escape from reality

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on, but nothing really matters  
  
Too late, my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Someplace better than were you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
Chorus:  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me?

The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
But we both know that a change is coming  
Come on closer, sweet release  
  
Chorus  
  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
  
Lyrics written by Marjon

Ooh  
Oh Oh Oh  
I get some headaches when I hit the heights  
Like in the morning after crazy nights  
Like some mother in law in her nylon tights  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the tracks  
You take 'em  
The same old babies with the same old toys  
The neighbors screaming when the noise annoys  
Somebody naggin' you when you're out with the boys  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
Yeah yeah yeah

Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
You're taking all the sunshine away  
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)  
'Cause you're a cool cat  
Tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart, huh!  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
  
Ooh you're a cool cat  
Coming on strong with all the chit chat  
Ooh you're alright  
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight  
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah!  
  
Ooh you used to be a mean kid  
Ooh making such a deal of life  
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting  
To really hit the big time  
But did it happen? Happen, no!  
You're speeding too fast, slow down  
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down  
  
You really know how to set the mood  
And you really get inside the groove  
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah!  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Can you feel it?  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Ooh feeling, feeling, feeling  
Feeling every feeling.

This thing called love, I just can't handle it  
This thing called love, I must get round to it  
I ain't ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing (this thing)  
Called love (called love)  
It cries (like a baby)  
In a cradle all night  
It swings (woo woo)  
It jives (woo woo)  
It shakes all over like a jelly fish  
I kinda like it  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
There goes my baby  
She knows how to rock 'n' roll  
She drives me crazy  
She gives me hot and cold fever  
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat  
  
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip  
And get on my track's  
Take a back seat, hitch-hike  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until I'm ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip  
And get on my track's  
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike (ah hum)  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing called love, I just can't handle it  
This thing called love, I must get round to it  
I ain't ready  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Crazy little thing called love  
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

Words and music by freddie mercury  
  
You suck my blood like a leech  
You break the law and you preach  
Screw my brain till it hurts  
You've taken all my money  
And you want more  
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules  
With your narrow minded cronies  
Who are fools of the first division  
Death on two legs  
You're tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
You've never had a heart of your own  
Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry  
You're just an old barrow boy  
Have you found a new toy to replace me?  
Can you face me?  
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye  
Feel good are you satisfied?  
Do you feel like suicide?  
(i think you should)  
Is your conscience all right  
Does it plague you at night?  
Do you feel good feel good?  
  
You talk like a big business tycoon  
You're just a hot air balloon  
So no one gives you a damn  
You're just an overgrown schoolboy  
Let me tan your hide  
A dog with disease  
You're the king of the 'sleaze'  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Mister know-all  
Was the fin on your back  
Part of the deal? (shark)  
Death on two legs  
You're tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own  
(right from the start)  
Insane you should be put inside  
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride  
Should be made unemployed  
Then make yourself null and void  
Make me feel good i feel good

Looking round to find the words to say  
Should be waiting for the skies to clear  
There ain't time in all the world

And anyway I've got to hide away  
  
Yesterday my life was in ruin  
Now today God knows what I'm doing

Doing all right

I think I'm going back  
To the things I learnt so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
Now, there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more colouring books  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can't play the game of life to win  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
And, now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
And every day can be  
My magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears  
And live my days instead of counting my years  
Then everyone debates  
The true reality  
I'd rather see the world  
The way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom's all we lack  
So catch me if you can  
I'm going back

Take good care of what you've got  
My father said to me  
As he puffed his pipe and baby B.  
He dandled on his knee  
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away  
Keep all good company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company  
  
Soon I grew and happy too  
My very good friends and me  
We'd play all day with Sally J.  
The girl from number four  
Very soon I begged her won't you  
Keep me company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Come marry me for evermore we'll  
Be good company  
  
Now marriage is an institution sure  
My wife and I our needs and nothing more  
All my friends by a year  
By and by disappeared  
But we're safe enough behind our door  
  
I flourished in my humble trade  
My reputation grew  
The work devoured my waking hours  
But when my time was through  
Reward of all my efforts my own  
Limited company  
  
I hardly noticed Sally as we  
Parted company  
All through the years in the end it appears  
There was never really anyone but me  
  
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe  
But no-one's there to see  
I ponder on the lesson of  
My life's insanity  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company

I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things  
We can do the tango just for two  
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings  
Be your Valentino just for you  
  
Ooh love - ooh loverboy  
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy  
Set my alarm, turn on my charm  
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy  
  
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)  
Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat  
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love  
And tell me how do you feel right after-all  
I'd like for you and I to go romancing  
Say the word - your wish is my command  
  
Ooh love - ooh loverboy  
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy  
Write my letter  
Feel much better  
And use my fancy patter on the telephone  
  
When I'm not with you  
I think of you always  
(I miss those long hot summer nights)  
I miss you  
When I'm not with you  
Think of me always  
Love you - love you  
  
Hey boy where do you get it from  
Hey boy where did you go ?  
I learned my passion in the good old  
Fashioned school of loverboys  
  
Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely  
(One two three four five six seven eight nine o' clock)  
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine  
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely  
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)  
  
Ooh love, (There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy)  
Ooh loverboy  
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy  
Everything's all right  
Just hold on tight  
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned fashioned lover boy  

Don't let go  
Don't lose your mystique  
Wait a little longer  
Tomorrow brings another feast  
  
Don't let go  
Don't lose your reputation  
Thank God you're still alive, ha  
You're still in one piece  
  
Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite  
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs  
Pray for that magical moment (just stay there) and it will appear  
(Don't fight for lost emotions)  
Wait for the sunrise,  
And everything will seem so clear  
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead)  
  
Hang on in there (hang on in there)  
Hang on in there (hang on in there)  
Your wish will be granted  
All your problems will disappear  
  
Don't be a fool  
You haven't reached your peak  
You've got a fast car racing up inside you  
Your life is incomplete  
  
Hang on in there, hang on in there  
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear  
(Wait for the moment)  
Wait for the sunrise - oh  
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear  
Ba dap bap ee bap bap ba ba bap bap de de de da  
Hey  
And let's go, let's go - o.k. now do the change now  
Hang on  
Yeah  
Hang on in there, hang on in there  
Yeah hang on in there, yeah  

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal  
And you're rushing headlong out of control  
And you think you're so strong  
But there ain't no stopping and there's nothin'  
You can do about it  
There's nothin' you can do  
No there's nothin' you can do about it  
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can  
Nothin' you can do about it  
  
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal  
And you're rushing headlong out of control  
And you think you're so strong  
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'  
You can do about it  
Yeah  
  
Hey, he used to be a man with a stick in his hand  
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do  
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand  
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do  
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag  
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag  
You're gettin' in a fight  
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night  
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie  
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing  
Headlong out of control  
And you think you're so strong  
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'  
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can  
Nothin' you can do about it  
  
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady  
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do (ho)  
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy  
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do  
Oh, now they start freaking everyway you turn  
You can't start walking 'cos your feet got burned  
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right  
Cause reasons out the window  
Better hold on tight - you're rushing headlong  
Headlong out of control, yeah  
You think you're so strong  
There ain't no stopping and there's nothin' you, nothin' you  
Nothin' you can do about it at all  
Yeah yeah alright go  
And you're rushing headlong down the highway  
And you're rushing headlong out of control  
And you think you're so strong  
But there ain't no stopping  
There's nothin', nothin', nothin' you can do about it, yeah  
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ha ha

This could be heaven for everyone  
This could be heaven  
This could be heaven  
This could be heaven

In these days of cool reflection (reflection)  
You come to me and everything seems alright  
In these days of cold affections  
You sit by me - and everything's fine  
  
This could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be fed, this world could be fun  
This could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be free, this world could be one  
  
In this world of cool deception  
Just your smile can smooth my ride  
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm  
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind  
  
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be fed, (yeah) this world could be fun  
This should be love for everyone, yeah  
This world should be free, (yeah) this world could be one  
We should bring love to our daughters and sons  
Love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone  
You know that  
This could be heaven for everyone yes  
Ha ha haa  
This could be heaven for everyone, yea he he he - woh  
Heaven for everyone  
  
Listen - what people do to other souls  
They take their lives - destroy their goals  
Their basic pride and dignity  
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity  
When this should be heaven for everyone  
  
This could be heaven  
This could be heaven  
This could be heaven for everyone  
This could be heaven wooh  
Could be heaven for everyone  
This could be heaven

Love love love love love

This could be heaven  
This could be heaven  
This could be heaven  
For everyone  
For everyone  

I say hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you  
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
You passed me by one sunny day  
Flashed those big brown eyes my way  
Ooh, I wanted you forever more  
Hey, I'm not one that get's around  
Swear my feet stuck to the ground  
And though I never did see you no more  
Yeah neah  
I said hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you  
Hey, I knew Mary Lou we'd never part  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
One more time  
Yes, hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Hey, wait a minute  
One minute  
Ah, I need my fucking water  
I don't care, let's go  
Right, give us the right key for fuck's sake

Words and music by Queen  
Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day  
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts  
Nothing much to say  
When suddenly I got hit  
Imagine my suprise  
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes  
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile  
I'd never seen anything that came within miles  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Stuck in the traffic  
Stuck at the lights what do I see  
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me  
She takes off  
Imagine my disgust  
Like a bat out of hell  
I get to eat her dust  
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh  
I'd never known anything that counted by half  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Hijack my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Steals my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Look at the cities  
Look at the streets what do you see  
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be  
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose  
It comes out of nowhere  
Right out of the blue  
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile  
I'd never seen anything that came within miles  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Hijack my heart  
Now you really got a hold on me  
You hijacked my heart  
Don't you know you won't let me be  
Stole my heart  
Threw away the key  
Oooee baby what's become of me  
You hijacked my heart  
Now you really got a hold on me  
Hijack my heart

(Freddie)  
When all the salt is taken from the sea  
I stand dethroned  
I'm naked and I plea  
The way your finger points so solidly  
Is anybody there to believe in me  
To hear my plea  
And take care of me  
[Chorus:]  
How can I go on  
From day to day  
Who can make me strong  
In every way  
Where can I be safe  
Where can I belong  
In this great big world  
Of sadness  
How can I forget  
Those beautiful dreams that we shared  
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found  
How can I go on  
(Monserrat)  
Sometimes I start to crawl  
But in my eyes  
I cannot see  
When people fly by me  
I hide myself down near the ground  
Is anybody there  
To look for me  
(Freddie)  
La-da-da-da-da precious love  
Hear my plea-yeah!  
[Chorus:]  
How can I go on  
From day to day  
Who can make me strong  
In every way  
Where can I be safe  
Where can I belong  
In this great big world  
Of sadness  
How can I forget  
Those beautiful dreams that we shared

This is the way I always dreamed it would be  
The way that it is, o-oh,when you are holding me  
I never had a love of my own  
Maybe that's why when we're all alone  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
  
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear  
Oh well I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near  
  
Loving you it keeps me satisfied  
And I can't explain,oh no,the way I'm feeling inside  
You look at me we kiss and then  
I close my eyes and here it comes again  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
  
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear  
Oh well I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near

I can't live with you  
But I can't live without you  
I can't let you stay  
Ooh but I can't live if you go away  
I don't know just how it goes  
All I know is I can't live with you  
  
Yeah I'm having a hard time  
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair  
You may think that I don't care  
But I traveled a long road to get hold of my sorrow  
I tried to catch a dream  
But nothing's what it seems  
Love is saying baby it's all right  
When deep inside you're really petrified  
Lover turns to hater  
On this escalator  
  
I can't live with you, yeah  
But I can't live without you  
I can't breathe if you stay  
But I can't bear you to go away  
I don't know what time it is  
All I know is I can't live with you  
  
We're stuck in a bad place  
We're trapped in a rat race  
And we can't escape  
Maybe there's been some mistake  
We're trying to make a high score  
We're walking through a closed door  
And nobody's winning  
We're just sinning against ourselves  
  
Hold on baby tell me it's all right  
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside  
Passions screaming hotter  
Doin' what we gotta do, yeah  
  
I can't live with you I can't live with you  
I can't live I can't live  
I can't I can't live with you  
But baby I'll never ever leave you  
  
I can't live with you  
But I can't live without you  
Cause I'm in love with you  
Ooh and everything about you  
  
I can't live with you  
No I just can't live I just can't live  
I can't live with you  
Yeah and I can't live without you  
Through the madness through the tears  
We've still got each other  
For a million years, yeah  
  
Ooh yeah  
Yeah, I can't live without you, yeah yeah  
I can't live without you  
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh  
I can't live without you  
I can't live without you  
I can't live without you  
Oh oh, I can't live without you, baby baby baby  
Without you  
I can't live without you

I took my baby dancing, to see a heavy band  
But I never saw my baby till the encore  
She had the singer by the hand  
I didn't want to cry 'cause I had to be cool  
I didn't want to tell you that you're much too cruel  
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool?  
  
[Chorus]  
All I gotta do is think about you  
Every night and day I go crazy  
All I gotta do is get my hands on you  
You better stay away from me, baby  
  
I wouldn't mind the postman if the neighbors didn't know  
Or the gas man, electric man, man to fix the car  
I'd have to let it go  
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n roll clone  
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone  
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?  
Go ahead, fool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more  
I don't want to go and see Queen no more, no more  
I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more  
I don't want to go and see Queen no more, no more  
  
Now, I don't want to hurt you like you been a-hurting me  
But you know I'll be watchin'  
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV  
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at  
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat  
To think I nearly let you get away with all that  
No way, man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, you'd better stay away from me, baby  
Baby, baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Adventure seeker on an empty street  
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet  
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt  
With the pain and anger can't see a way out  
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say  
Gotta find me a future move out of my way  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now  
  
Listen all you people, come gather round  
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground  
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine  
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign  
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth  
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth  
  
I want it all (give it all - I want it all)  
I want it all (yeah)  
I want it all and I want it now  
  
I want it all (yes I want it all)  
I want it all hey  
I want it all and I want it now  
  
I'm a man with a one track mind  
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me)  
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies  
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all  
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all  
Oooh oh yeah yeah - ha ha ha ha ha  
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah  
I want it all  
  
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth  
Here's to the future  
Hear the cry of youth (hear the cry of youth) (hear the cry of youth)  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all and I want it now  
  
I want it all yeah yeah yeaaaah  
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now  
Oh oh oh oh oooh  
  
And I want it - now  
I want it, I want it  
Ooooh ha

I want to break free  
I want to break free  
I want to break free from your lies  
You're so self satisfied I don't need you  
I've got to break free  
God knows, God knows I want to break free  
  
I've fallen in love  
I've fallen in love for the first time  
And this time I know it's for real  
I've fallen in love yeah  
God knows God knows I've fallen in love  
  
It's strange but it's true  
I can't get over the way you love me like you do  
But I have to be sure  
When I walk out that door  
Oh how I want to be free baby  
Oh how I want to be free  
Oh how I want to break free  
  
But life still goes on  
I can't get used to living without living without  
Living without you by my side  
I don't want to live alone hey  
God knows got to make it on my own  
So baby can't you see  
I've got to break free  
  
I've got to break free  
I want to break free yeah  
  
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely  
Don't let them get you down  
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone  
Hangin' around for someone to call  
Ooh they won't come knocking at all  
Don't run and hide  
Even if it hurts you inside  
So I said  
Give as good as you get  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You're never gonna help yourself  
  
Come on  
Get up  
You're feelin' good  
  
Keep your fingers off my money  
Don't try and pull me down  
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me  
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around  
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!  
Rumor has it that you could play dirty  
I'll tell you what I'll do about that  
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You're never gonna help yourself  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
It's everyone for themselves  
Move on out

Oooh  
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine  
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam  
When I'm holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
With my hand on your grease gun  
Mmm, it's like a disease, son  
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile  
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar  
Such a thrill when your radials squeal  
  
Told my girl I'll have to forget her  
Rather buy me a new carburetor  
So she made tracks saying this is the end, now  
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now  
  
When I'm holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive  
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive  
  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), gotta feel for my automobile  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), string back gloves in my
automolove

In my defence what is there to say  
All the mistakes we made must be faced today  
It's not easy now knowing where to start  
While the world we love tears itself apart  
I'm just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
For just a singer with a melody  
I'm caught in between  
With a fading dream  
  
In my defence what is there to say  
We destroy the love - it's our way  
We never listen enough never face the truth  
Then like a passing song  
Love is here and then it's gone  
  
I'm just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
For just a singer with a melody  
I'm caught in between  
With a fading dream  
  
I'm just a singer with a song  
How can I try to right the wrong  
I'm just a singer with a melody  
I'm caught in between with a fading dream  
Caught in between with a fading dream  
Caught in between with a fading dream  
  
Oh what on earth  
Oh what on earth  
How do I try  
Do we live or die  
  
Oh help me God  
Please help me

It's so easy, but I can't do it  
So risky - But I gotta chance it  
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about  
My money, that's all you want to talk about  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
No beginning, there's no ending  
There's no meaning in my pretending  
Believe me, life goes on and on and on  
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong  
You say I can't set you free from me  
But that's not true  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
Wo wo la la la wo  
Wo wo la la  
Wah wah ooh  
But that's not true

Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed  
Take a look at all the suffering we breed  
So many lonely faces scattered all around  
Searching for what they need  
  
Is this the world we created?  
What did we do it for  
Is this the world we invaded  
Against the law  
So it seems in the end  
Is this what we're all living for today  
The world that we created  
  
You know that everyday a helpless child is born  
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home  
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne  
Waiting for life to go by  
  
Wooh, is this the world we created?  
We made it all our own  
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone  
If there's a God in the sky looking down  
What can he think of what we've done  
To the world that he created

I don't want my freedom  
There's no reason for living with a broken heart  
  
This is a tricky situation  
I've only got myself to blame  
It's just a simple fact of life  
It can happen to any one  
  
You win - you lose  
It's a chance you have to take with love  
Oh yeah - I fell in love  
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart  
  
Yeah yeah  
It's a hard life  
To be true lovers together  
To love and live forever in each others hearts  
It's a long hard fight  
To learn to care for each other  
To trust in one another right from the start  
When you're in love  
  
I try and mend the broken pieces  
Ooh, I try to fight back the tears  
Ooh, they say it's just a state of mind  
But it happens to everyone  
  
How it hurts (yeah) - deep inside (oh yeah)  
When your love has cut you down to size  
This life is tough - on your own  
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies  
I'm waiting for love  
  
Yes it's a hard life  
Two lovers together  
To love and live forever in each others hearts  
It's a long hard fight  
To learn to care for each other  
To trust in one another - right from the start  
When you're in love  
  
Yes it's a hard life  
In a world that's filled with sorrow  
There are people searching for love in every way  
It's a long hard fight  
But I'll always live for tomorrow  
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love (ooh)  
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love

Take off  
I was told a million times  
Of all the troubles in my way  
Mind you grow a little wiser  
Little better every day  
But if I crossed a million rivers  
And I rode a million miles  
Then I'd still be where I started  
Bread and butter for a smile  
Well I sold a million mirrors  
In a shopping alley way  
But I never saw my face  
In any window any day  
Now they say your folks are telling you  
Be a super star  
But I tell you just be satisfied  
Stay right where you are  
  
Keep yourself alive yeah  
Keep yourself alive  
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money  
Honey you'll survive  
  
Ow  
  
Well I've loved a million women  
In a belladonic haze  
And I ate a million dinners  
Brought to me on silver trays  
Give me everything I need  
To feed my body and my soul  
And I'll grow a little bigger  
Maybe that can be my goal  
I was told a million times  
Of all the people in my way  
How I had to keep on trying  
And get better every day  
But if I crossed a million rivers  
And I rode a million miles  
Then I'd still be where I started  
Same as when I started  
  
Keep yourself alive, come on  
Keep yourself alive  
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey  
You'll survive - shake  
  
Ow  
Keep yourself alive, wow  
Keep yourself alive  
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money  
To keep me satisfied  
  
Do you think you're better every day?  
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave  
  
Keep yourself alive, c'mon  
Keep yourself alive  
Mm, you take your time and take more money  
Keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
C'mon keep yourself alive  
All you people keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive  
It'll take you all your time and a money  
To keep me satisfied  
Keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
All you people keep yourself alive  
Take you all your time and money honey  
You will survive  
  
Keep you satisfied

She never kept the same address  
In conversation  
She spoke just like a baroness  
Met a man from China  
Went down to Geisha Minah  
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)  
Then again incidentally  
If you're that way inclined  
  
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)  
For cars she couldn't care less  
Fastidious and precise

Gunpowder, guillotine  
Dynamite with a laser beam  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Anytime  
  
Drop of a hat she's as willing as  
Playful as a pussy cat

Temporarily out of gas  
To absolutely drive you wild, wild  
She's all out to get you

Gunpowder, gelatin  
Dynamite with a laser beam  
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Killrock  
Killrock

I take a step outside  
And I breath the air  
And I slam the door  
And I'm on my way  
I won't lay no blame  
I won't call you names  
'Cause I've made my break  
And I won't look back  
I've turned my back  
On those endless games  
  
I'm all through with ties  
I'm all tired of tears  
I'm a happy man  
Don't it look that way  
Shakin' dust from my shoes  
There's a road ahead  
And there's no way back home (no way back home)  
Oh but I have to say  
  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
Oh I never thought it would be easy  
Leavin' on your own  
Oh is the main thing calling me back  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
On the one you're leavin' home  
  
Stay my love my love please stay  
Don't stray my love  
What's wrong my love?  
What's right my love?  
Oh leavin' home ain't easy  
I thought how could I think of leavin'  
Leavin' on your own  
Still tryin' to persuade me that  
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
But may be the only way

Words and music by Freddie Mercury

Nowhere to go nothing to do with my time

You might believe in heaven  
I would not care to say  
For every star in heaven  
There's a sad soul here today  
Wake up in the morning with a good face  
Stare at the moon all day  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
Does anyone care anyway  
For all the prayers in heaven  
So much of life's this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Who knows when now who knows where  
Where the light of day will find us  
Look for the day  
  
Take heart my friend we love you  
Though it seems like you're alone  
A million light's above you  
Smile down upon your home  
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase  
Come let the new child play  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
I'm leaving here,I'm long away  
For all the stars in heaven  
I would not live I could not live this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Leave it for some hopeless lane  
Such a long long way such a long long way  
Such a long long way I'm looking for  
Still looking for that day

Machines  
  
It's a machines world  
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul  
When the machines take over  
It ain't no place for rock and roll  
  
They tell me I don't care  
But deep inside I'm just a man  
They freeze me they burn me  
They squeeze me they stress me  
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me  
But no one but no one but no one can wrest me away  
Back to humans  
  
We have no disease no trouble of mind  
No thank you or please no regard for the time  
We never cry we never retreat  
We have no conception of love or defeat  
  
What's that machine noise?  
It's bytes and megachips for tea  
It's that machine boys  
With random access memory  
Never worry never mind  
Not for money not for gold  
  
It's software is hardware  
It's heartbeat is time-share  
It's midwife's a disc drive  
It's sex life is quantised  
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised  
  
Back to humans  
Back to humans

Ages past I gave all you people  
Food and water  
  
Three feet tall so very small I'm no trouble

For all the people in the land  
  
A message of love

Oh and then one day you realise  
You're all the same we've been in life  
All I've come to say just like before

I'm taking my right with destiny  
Willing to play my part  
Living with painful memories  
Loving with all my heart  
  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
It was all meant to be, yeah  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what they say  
Can't you see  
That's what everybody says to me  
Can't you see  
Oh I know, I know, I know, that its true  
Yes its really meant to be  
Deep in my heart  
  
I'm having to learn to pay the price  
Theyre turning me upside down  
Waiting for possibilities  
Don't see too many around  
Made in heaven, yes made in heaven  
Its for all to see  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what everybody says  
Everybody says to me  
It was really meant to be  
Oh can't you see  
Yeah, everybody, everybody says  
Yes it was meant to be  
Yeah, yeah  
  
When stormy weather comes around  
It was made in heaven  
When sunny skies break through behind the clouds  
I wish it could last forever, yeah  
Wish it could last forever, forever  
  
I'm playing my role in history  
Looking to find my goal  
Taking in all this misery  
But giving it all my soul  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
It was all meant to be  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what everybody says  
Wait and see, it was really meant to be  
So plain to see  
Yeah, everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so  
Yes it was plain to see, yes it was meant to be  
Written in the stars...  
Written in the stars...

Oh yeah  
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side  
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas  
I'm gonna get me some action  
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane  
My baby left me alone  
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely  
So come home, come home  
If you don't you're gonna break my heart  
  
Man on the prowl  
You better watch out  
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble  
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)  
I'm a man on the prowl  
  
I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady  
I just wanna be low down trash  
I wanna go to the movies  
All I wanna do is sit on my ass - ooh  
So honey come home (come home come home)  
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely  
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)  
If you don't you're gonna break my heart  
  
Man on the prowl  
You better watch out  
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble  
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)  
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl  
  
Well I keep dreaming about my baby  
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere  
(Bap bap) hey

'Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah  
Man on the prowl - yeah  
Hey, stay with it  
Loosen up  
Wooh yep ha wooh ha  
Yeah  

I don't want to sleep with you  
I don't need the passion too  
I don't want a stormy affair  
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere  
All I want is the comfort and care  
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet -  
Mother love ah ha  
  
I've walked too long in this lonely lane  
I've had enough of this same old game  
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong  
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone  
  
Out in the city, in the cold world outside  
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide  
Mama please, let me back inside  
  
I don't want to make no waves  
But you can give me all the love that I crave  
I can't take it if you see me cry  
I long for peace before I die  
All I want is to know that you're there  
You're gonna give me all your sweet -  
Mother love ah ha (mother love)  
  
My body's aching, but I can't sleep  
My dreams are all the company I keep  
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down  
I'm coming home to my sweet -  
Mother love  
  
(Mother love mother love love love love love)  
God works in mysterious ways  
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop  
I think I'm goin' back to the things I learnt so well in my youth

Aah, aah  
In the land where horses born with eagle wings  
And honey bees have lost their stings  
There's singing forever, ooh yeah  
Lion's den with fallow deer  
And rivers made from wine so clear  
Flow on and on forever  
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air  
And baby lambs where Samson dares  
To go on on on on on on  
  
My fairy king can see things  
He rules the air and turns the tides  
That are not there for you and me  
Ooh yeah he guides the winds  
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong  
  
Ah, then came man to savage in the night  
To run like thieves and to kill like knives  
To take away the power from the magic hand  
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah  
  
They turn the milk into sour  
Like the blue in the blood of my veins  
Why can't you see it  
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain  
Son of heaven set me free and let me go  
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand  
Seasons fly no helping hand  
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah  
  
Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings  
Broken my fairy circle ring  
And shamed the king in all his pride  
Changed the winds and wronged the tides  
Mother Mercury Mercury  
Look what they've done to me  
I cannot run, I cannot hide  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  

Another party's over  
And I'm left cold sober  
My baby left me for somebody new  
I don't wanna talk about it  
Want to forget about it  
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew  
So come and get me  
Let me  
Get in that sinking feeling  
That says my heart is on an all time low - so  
Don't expect me  
To behave perfectly  
And wear that sunny smile  
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast  
Don't try and stop me  
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon  
I'm causing a mild sensation  
With this new occupation  
I'm permanently glued  
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over  
And let me take over  
With my melancholy blues  
  
I'm causing a mild sensation  
With this new occupation  
I'm in the news  
I'm just getting used to my new exposure  
Come into my enclosure  
And meet my melancholy blues

There's no living in my life anymore  
The seas have gone dry  
And the rain's stopped falling  
Please don't you cry any more  
Can't you see  
Listen to the breeze  
Whisper to me please  
Don't send me to the path of nevermore  
  
Even the valley's below  
Where the rays of the sun  
Were so warm and tender  
Now haven't anything to grow  
Can't you see?  
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)  
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)  
You sent me to the path of nevermore  
When you say you didn't love me anymore  
Ah ah nevermore nevermore

Here I stand (here I stand)  
Look around around around around around  
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)  
  
Now I'm here (Now I'm here), now I'm there (Now I'm there)  
I'm just a?just a new man  
Yes you made me live again, wow  
  
A baby I was when you took my hand  
And the light of the night burned bright  
The people all stared didn't understand  
But you new my name on sight  
  
Ooh whatever came of you and me  
America's new bride to be - ooh, don't worry baby I'm safe and sound  
  
Down in the dungeon just peaches 'n' me  
  
Don't I love her so  
Yes you made me live again, yeah  
  
Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky  
Where the beams of your lovelight chase  
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain  
With the rain running down my face  
  
Your matches still light up the sky  
And many a tear lives on in my eye  
  
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me  
Don't I love him so  
Ooh, don't I love him so  
Wooh  
  
Whatever comes of you and me  
I love to leave my memory with you  
  
Now I'm here (Now I'm here)  
Think I'll stay around around around around around around  
Down in the city justa you 'n' me (down in the city justa you 'n' me)  
Don't I love you so  
Go, go, go, little Queenie  
Wooh

Fa fa fa fa fa  
Fa fa fa fa faa  
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable  
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table  
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination  
That is the sign  
Come tonight  
Come to the ogre sight  
Come to the ogre-battle-fight  
  
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean  
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size  
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction  
Now the battle is on  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Come tonight  
Come to the ogre sight  
Come to the ogre-battle-fight  
  
Fa fa fa fa faa  
Hoooa  
  
The ogre-men are still inside  
The two-way mirror mountain  
You gotta keep down right out of sight  
You can't see in, but they can see out  
"Ooh keep a look out"  
The ogre-men are coming out  
From the two-way mirror mountain  
They're running up behind and they're coming all about  
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south  
  
Aaargh  
Aaaaaaaarghh  
Ogre-men are going home  
The great big fight is over  
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry  
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh  
You can come along  
You can come along  
Come to ogre battle  
Fa fa fa fa faa  

We had a good night jamming away  
There was a full moon showing  
And we started to play  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Party was over - huh  
The party was over  
We got love and we got style  
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes  
Woah woah woah woah woah  
Woah woah woah  
Why don't you come back and play  
Come back and play - hey hey - come back and play  
We got all night all day  
Everybody's gone away  
Why don't you come back and play - play play, come back and play  
Come back and play, come back and play play play play, aah  
Go get 'em boy - let's party  
Yeah - ha ha ha ha haaa - give it, give it  
We had a food fight in somebody's face  
We were up all night singing - singin'  
And giving a chase  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Everybody was hung-over  
Hey, come back and play, come back and play, come back and play  
We got all night all day  
Everybody's gone away  
Why don't you come back and play - and play  
Come back and play  
We got all night, we got all day  
We got all night to play  
Ah, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play  
Hey hey hey  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over  

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you  
I'm still alright to smile  
Girl, I think about you every day now  
Was a time when I wasn't sure  
But you set my mind at ease  
There is no doubt you're in my heart now  
Said woman take it slow  
It'll work itself out fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
Said sugar make it slow  
And we'll come together fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
(inhale) Patience...  
Ooh, oh, yeah  
Sit here on the stairs  
'Cause I'd rather be alone  
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear  
Sometimes, I get so tense  
But I can't speed up the time  
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider  
Said woman take it slow  
Things will be just fine  
You and I'll just use a little patience  
Said sugar take the time  
'Cause the lights are shining bright  
You and I've got what it takes to make it  
We won't fake it, Oh never break it  
'Cause I can't take it  
... Little patience, mm yeah, ooh yeah,  
Need a little patience, yeah  
Just a little patience, yeah  
Some more pati... (ence, yeah)  
I've been walking these streets at night  
Just trying to get it right (Need some patience, yeah)  
It's hard to see with so many around  
You know I don't like being stuck in a crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)  
And the streets don't change but maybe the name  
I ain't got time for the game  
'Cause I need you (Patience, yeah)  
Yeah, yeah well I need you  
Oh, I need you (Take some patience)  
Whoa, I need you (Just a little patience is all we need)  
Ooh, this ti- me....

Open up your mind and let me step inside  
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide  
It's so easy when you know the rules  
It's so easy all you have to do  
Is fall in love  
Play the game  
Everybody play the game of love  
Ooh yeah  
  
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low  
Light another cigarette and let yourself go  
This is your life  
Don't play hard to get  
It's a free world  
All you have to do is fall in love  
Play the game - yeah  
Everybody play the game of love  
Ooh yeah  
  
My game of love has just begun  
Love runs from my head down to my toes  
My love is pumping through my veins  
Play the game  
Driving me insane  
Come come come come come play the game  
Play the game play the game play the game

All you have to do is fall in love  
Play the game yeah everybody play the game of love

In the bright shop window sits the polar bear  
Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there  
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile  
To see him as you'd see a star  
Love him from where you are  
He's not for, not for, not for sale  
  
Past an open window walks the pretty girl  
Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell  
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away  
To see her as I'd see a star  
Love her from where you are  
She's not for, not for, not for sale  
  
I guess I'll learn to look  
Without a grasping hand  
Minor contentment wears a smile  
I love her from where I lie  
He's not for, not for, not for sale  
Not for sale

Here we are, born to be kings  
We're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong, fighting to survive  
In a world with the darkest powers, heh  
And here we are, we're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong, fighting for survival  
We've come to be the rulers of you all  
  
I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings - yeah - yeah  
I have no rival, no man can be my equal  
Take me to the future of you all  
  
Born to be kings, princes of the universe  
Fighting and free  
Got your world in my hand  
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand  
We were born to be princes of the universe  
  
No man could understand  
My power is in my own hand  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, people talk about you  
People say you've had your day  
I'm a man that will go far  
Fly the moon and reach for the stars  
With my sword and head held high  
Got to pass the test first time - yeah  
I know that people talk about me - I hear it every day  
But I can prove them wrong 'cos I'm right first time  
Yeah, yeah, alright, let's go, let's go, ha haa  
Yeah, watch this man fly, wooh  
Bring on the girls - c'mon - c'mon - c'mon  
Here we are - here we are  
Born to be kings, we're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong  
Born to be kings, princes of the universe  
Fighting and free, got your world in my hand  
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand  
We were born to be princes of the universe, of the universe, of the universe  
Of the universe of the universe

They called him a hero  
In the land of the free  
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy  
He disappointed me  
So I got my hand gun  
And I blew him away  
That critter was a bad guy  
And I had to make him pay  
  
You might fear for my reason  
I don't care what they say  
Look out baby it's the season  
For the mad masquerade  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said  
  
She was my lover  
It was a shame that she died  
But the constitution's right on my side  
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbour's bed  
I got retribution  
Filled 'em all full of lead  
  
I've been told it's the fashion  
To let me on the streets again  
It's nothing but a crime of passion  
And I'm not to blame  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
You need a weapon like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, baby put out the fire  
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds  
  
You know a gun never killed nobody  
You can ask anyone  
People get shot by people  
People with guns  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
You need a gun like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead  
  
Shoot, shoot...

You look at me every day.  
You look at me, and what do you say?  
You say, lookey there! It's the queen!  
It's the Queen of Groucho!  
You stand there gaping at the queen,  
Hopin' for an autograph.  
The queen says, no, sir, I refuse.  
I'm the Queen of Groucho!!!  
Death to the queen!!!  
Death to the queen!!!  
Death to the queen of groucho!!!  
Death to the queen!!!  
Death to the queen!!!  
Death to the queen of groucho!!!  
I am the Queen of Groucho,  
Though I just pretend to be.  
I'm really the King of Sloucho,  
And now I have to pee  
Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh...

I can see it in your stars  
Life is so exciting  
Acting so bizarre  
Your world is so inviting  
Playing really cool  
And looking so mysterious - honey  
Your every day is full of sunshine  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
No problem  
Uh, be cool now  
  
Anyone who imagines  
They can blind you with science  
Bully you all over  
With property and finance  
But you have position  
To call the shots and name the price - honey  
You found success and recognition  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
Flow John  
  
You lead a fairy tale existence  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
Be cool, ha, kiss kiss  
  
Others seem to think  
You are over dramatizing  
Problems at work  
So it's hardly surprising  
There's little you can do  
To alter their opinions - honey  
You want a clean reputation  
But now you're facing complications  
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall  
Be cool, get serious, wooh, alright  
  
Play it nice and cool  
Play it nice and cool - yeah  
Chase me  
Ooh, one more time, ha ha, I like it  
Leave 'em there

Ride the wild wind

Gonna ride the whirlwind  
It ain't dangerous - enough for me  
  
Get your head down baby - yeah - we're gonna ride tonight  
Your angel eyes are shining bright

Gonna leave it all behind

Ride the wild wind (hey hey) hey hey hey hey

Let me be your guide

Hey little babe you're changing  
Babe are you feeling sore  
It ain't no use in pretending  
You don't want to play no more  
  
It's plain that you ain't no baby  
What would your mother say  
You're all dressed up like a lady  
How come you behave this way  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
To love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
Sail away sweet sister  
I'll always be in love with you  
  
Forgive me for what I told you  
My heart makes a fool of me  
You know that I'll never hold you  
I know that you gotta be free  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
To love you half as much as me  
Take it the way you want it  
But when they let you down my friend  
Sail away sweet sister  
Back to my arms again  
  
Hot child don't you know you're young  
You got your whole life ahead of you  
And you can throw it away too soon  
Way too soon  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody's  
Gonna love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
Sail away sweet sister  
I'll always be in love with you

It started off so well  
They said we made a perfect pair  
I clothed myself in your glory and your love  
How I loved you  
How I cried  
The years of care and loyalty  
Were nothing but a sham it seems  
The years belie we lived the lie  
"I love you 'til I die"  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me, save me  
I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
The slate will soon be clean  
I'll erase the memories  
To start again with somebody new  
Was it all wasted  
All that love?  
I hang my head and I advertise  
A soul for sale or rent  
I have no heart, I'm cold inside  
I have no real intent  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
Each night I cry and still believe the lie  
I love you 'til I die  
  
(Save me, save me, save me)  
Yea, yeah  
Save me yeah save me oh save me  
Don't let me face my life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home

The harder we play  
The faster we fall  
When we think that we know it all  
We know nothing at all  
  
The letter arrives  
Like a bolt from the blue  
So what's left of your lives  
All your dreams lost to you  
  
Say it's not true  
Say it today  
When I open my eyes  
Will it all go away  
  
Say it's not true  
Say it for real  
Can't be happening to you  
Can't be happening to me  
  
It's hard not to cry  
It's hard to believe  
So much heartache and pain  
So much reason to grieve  
  
With the wonders of science  
All the knowledge we've stored  
Magic cocktails for lives  
People just can't afford  
  
Say it's not true  
You can say it's not right  
It's hard to believe  
The size of the crime  
  
Say it's not true  
You can say it's not real  
Could be happening to you  
Could be happening to me

Eeh dah eeh dah  
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh  
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know  
Hey scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show  
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break  
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for God's sakes  
Over and over and over again  
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds  
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools  
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates (oooh oooh)  
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates  
(Oooh oooh)  
Over and over and over again  
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair  
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care  
It's only a life to be twisted and broken  
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah  
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sakes  
Over and over and over and over again - yeah  
  
Scandal, scandal  
Scandal, scandal  
  
Yes you're breaking my heart again  
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again  
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times  
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies  
And in the end the story deeper must hide (oooh)  
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside  
Scandal, scandal  
Scandal, scandal  

Seaside whenever you stroll along with me  
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside  
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine  
You say you will if you could but you can't  
I love you madly  
Let my imagination run away with you gladly  
A brand new angle highly commendable  
Seaside rendezvous  
  
I feel so romantic can we do it again?  
Can we do it again sometime I'd like that  
Fantastic see'est la vie mesdames et messieurs  
And at the peak of the season  
The Mediterranean  
This time of year it's so fashionable  
  
I feel like dancing in the rain  
Can I have a volunteer?  
Just keep right on dancing  
What a damn jolly good idea  
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact  
So 'tres charmant' my dear  
  
Underneath the moonlight  
Together we'll sail across the sea  
Reminiscing every night  
Meantime I ask you to be my Valentine  
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can  
I'll be your Valentino  
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino  
Get a new facial start a sensational  
Seaside rendezvous so adorable  
Seaside rendezvous ooh  
Seaside rendezvous  
Give us a kiss!

I like to sit here in the sunshine  
Trees in the fields are green sublime  
Suspended in time  
And don't it make you feel small?  
I like to sit here by the fire's light  
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night  
The stars burn bright  
And don't it make you feel small?  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away, find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone needs to find peace sublime  
I like to sit here in the autumn time  
The trees in the fields, they rustle in the wind  
The church bells gently chime  
Gentle on your mind, suspended in time  
And don't it make you feel small?  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone need to find peace sublime  
Oh, peace of mind  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away, find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away, find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away, find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone needs to find peace sublime  
Oh, peace of mind

My new purple shoes  
Been amazin' the people next door  
And my rock 'n roll forty fives  
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor  
  
I got a way with the girls on my block  
Try my best to be a real individual  
And when we go down to smokies and rock  
They line up like it's some kind of ritual  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place  
  
I like the good things in life  
But most of the best things ain't free  
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife  
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy  
Young and you're crazy...  
  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

Words and music by brian may  
  
When I'm gone no need to wonder  
If I ever think of you  
The same moon shines  
The same wind blows for both of us  
And time is but a paper moon  
Be not gone  
  
Though I'm gone it's as though  
I hold the flower that touches you  
A new life grows  
The blossom knows there's no one else  
Could warm my heart as much as you  
Be not gone  
  
Let us cling together as the years go by  
Oh my love my love  
In the quiet of the night  
Let our candle always burn  
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned  
  
Teo torriatte konomama iko  
Aisuruhito yo  
Shizukana yoi ni  
Hikario tomoshi  
Itoshiki oshieo idaki  
  
Hear my song still think of me  
The way you've come to think of me  
The nights grow long  
But dreams live on  
Just close your pretty eyes  
And you can be with me  
Dream on  
  
Teo torriatte konomama iko  
Aisuruhito yo  
Shizukana yoi ni  
Hikario tomoshi  
Itoshiki oshieo idaki  
  
When I'm gone they'll say we were all fools  
And we don't understand  
Oh be strong don't turn your heart  
We're all you're all we're all for all for always  
  
Let us cling together as the years go by  
Oh my love my love  
In the quiet of the night  
Let our candle always burn  
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

He's a fairy feller  
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered  
Round the new moon's shine  
To see the feller crack a nut  
At night's noon time  
To swing his axe he swears  
As he climbs he dares  
To deliver the master stroke  
  
Plow man wagoner will' and types  
Politician with senatorial pipe  
He's a dilly dally oh  
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown  
And a satyr peers under lady's gown  
He's a dirty fellow  
What a dirty laddie-oh  
  
Tatterdemalion and the junketer  
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter  
He's my hero ah  
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy  
Of his lady friend  
The nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)  
What a queer fellow  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Soldier sailor tinker tailor plow boy  
Waiting to hear the sound  
And the arch magician presides  
He is the leader  
  
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan  
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man  
Come to say hello  
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy  
Of his lady friend  
The nymph in yellow  
What a queer fellow  
The ostler stares with hands on his knees  
Come on mister feller  
Crack it open of you please

Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Pretending I'm doing well (ooh ooh)  
My need is such I pretend too much  
I'm lonely but no one can tell  
  
Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Adrift in a world of my own (ooh ooh)  
I play the game but to my real shame  
You've left me to dream all alone  
  
Too real is this feeling of make believe  
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal  
  
Ooh ooh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)  
I seem to be what I'm not (you see)  
I'm wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that you're still around  
  
Yeah ooh hoo  
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal  
  
Oh yes I'm the great pretender  
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)  
I seem to be what I'm not you see  
I'm wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that you're  
Pretending that you're still around

I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
  
Freddie Mercury  
When you hear a sound  
That you just can't place  
Feel somethin' move  
That you just can't trace  
When something sits  
On the end of your bed  
Don't turn around  
When you hear me tread  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
  
John Deacon  
And I'm in your room  
And I'm in your bed  
And I'm in your life  
And I'm in your head  
Like C.I.A.  
Or the F.B.I.  
You'll never get close  
Never take me alive  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Hah, hah, hah, hello  
Hah, hah, hah, o.k.  
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello  
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or girl  
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl  
So I make my mark from the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Brian May - Brian May  
  
Now I'm on your track  
And I'm in your mind  
And I'm on your back  
But don't look behind  
I'm your meanest thought  
I'm your darkest fear  
But I'll never get caught  
You can't shake me, shake me dear  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
Watch me now  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Look at me, look at me

Mama's got a problem  
She don't know what to say  
Her little baby boy  
Has just left home today  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend  
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
She washed and fed and clothed and cared  
For nearly twenty years  
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma  
And the night times for her tears  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend  
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
So listen mothers everywhere  
To just one mothers son  
You'll get forgotten on the way  
If you don't let them have their fun  
Forget regrets and just remember  
It's not so long since you were young  
  
You're bound to be the loser in the end  
You're bound to be the loser in the end  
They'll chose their new shoes  
That's not far to bend  
You're Ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh

Do you mean it ?  
Do you mean it ?  
Do you mean it ?  
Why don't you mean it ?  
Why do I follow you and where do you go  
Aah aah aah aah aah aah  
  
You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life  
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive  
Let me tell you all about it  
And the world will so allow it  
Ooh give me a little time to choose  
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight  
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night  
  
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile  
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file  
Take this, take that, bring them down to size  
March to the Black Queen  
  
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys  
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil  
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe  
We've only begun - begun  
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise  
March to the Black Queen  
Now I've got a belly-full  
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes  
  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa  
A voice from behind me reminds me  
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)  
Spread out your wings you are an angel  
Remember to deliver with the speed of light  
A little bit of love and joy  
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore  
A little bit of love and joy  
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover  
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love  
  
Aah ah aah  
La la la la laa  
Ah ah ah ah aah  
Ah la la la laa  
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right  
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night  
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen  
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie  
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like  
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black
Queen  
  
Ah aah ah aah  
Ah aah ah aah  
Walking true to style  
She's vulgar 'buse and vile  
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies  
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"  
  
She's our leader  
La la la la laa la la laa  
La la la la la laa  
  
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies  
Surrender to the city of the fireflies  
Dance with the devil in beat with the band  
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand  
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever  
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah  

Bring out the charge of the love brigade  
There is spring in the air once again  
Drink to the sound of the song parade  
There is music and love everywhere  
Give a little love to me (I want it)  
Take a little love from me, I want to share it with you  
I feel like a millionaire  
  
Once we were mad, we were happy  
We spent all our days holding hands together  
Do you remember, my love?  
How we danced and played  
In the rain we laid  
Wish that we could stay there, forever and ever  
  
Now I am sad  
You are so far away  
I sit counting the hours day by day  
Come back to me, how I long for your love  
Come back to me - be happy like we used to be  
Come back, come back to me  
Come back, come back to me - aah  
Oh, come back to me, oh my love  
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah  
My fine friend - take me wiz you unt love me forever  
My fine friend - forever - forever  
  
Bring out the charge of the love brigade

Come back, come back to me - make me feel  
You make me feel like a millionaire

Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all  
It's a miracle  
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal  
That's a miracle  
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone  
It's a miracle  
We're having a miracle on Earth, mother nature does it all for us  
The wonders of this world go on, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon  
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on Earth - an end to war  
It's a miracle we need - the miracle  
The miracle we're all waiting for today  
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle  
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat  
That's a miracle  
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony  
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on Earth  
Mother nature does it all for us  
(the wonders of this world go on)  
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea  
Super powers always fighting  
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
  
(The wonders of this world go on)  
Well it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
The one thing (the one thing)  
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)  
Is peace on Earth (peace on Earth) and an end to war (end to war)  
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle  
Peace on Earth and end to war today  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come  

When I was young it came to me  
And I could see the sun breakin'  
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling  
Holding the world inside  
Once I believed in ev'ryone  
Everyone and anyone can see  
  
Oh oh the night comes down  
And I get afraid of losing my way  
Oh oh the night comes down  
Oooh and it's dark again  
  
Once I could laugh with ev'ryone  
Once I could see the good in me  
The black and the white distinctively coloring  
Holding the world inside  
Now all the world is grey to me  
Nobody can see you gotta believe it  
  
Oh oh the night comes down  
And I get afraid of losing my way  
Oh oh the night comes down  
Oooh and it's dark again  
And it's dark again  
And it's dark again

Empty spaces, what are we living for  
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score  
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for  
Another hero, another mindless crime  
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime  
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore  
The show must go on  
The show must go on, yeah  
Inside my heart is breaking  
My make-up may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
  
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance  
Another heartache, another failed romance  
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?  
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)  
I must be warmer now  
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)  
Round the corner now  
Outside the dawn is breaking  
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free  
The show must go on  
The show must go on, yeah yeah  
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking  
My make-up may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
  
Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh  
  
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies  
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die  
I can fly, my friends  
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah  
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on)  
I'll face it with a grin  
I'm never giving in  
On, with the show  
  
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill  
I have to find the will to carry on  
On with the show  
On with the show  
The show, the show must go on  
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on  
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on  
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on  
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on  
Go on, go on
