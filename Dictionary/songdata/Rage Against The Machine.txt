Ughh!  
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack ughh!  
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack yeah!  
It goes a-one, two, three  
  
Hey yo, it's just another bomb track  
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade this  
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level  
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down  
Hand out some beat-downs  
Cold runna train on punk ho's that  
Think they run the game  
  
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete  
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete  
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag  
As I recall our downfall  
And the business that burned us all  
See through the news and the views that twist reality  
  
Enough  
I call the bluff  
Fuck manifest destiny  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
With the thoughts from a militant mind  
Hardline, hardline after hardline  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
  
It goes a one, two, three  
Another funky radical bombtrack  
Started as a sketch in my notebook  
And now dope hooks make punks take another look  
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear  
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere  
  
With the thoughts from a militant mind  
Hardline, hardline after hardline  
  
Landlords and power whores  
On my people they took turns  
Dispute the suits I ignite  
And then watch 'em burn  
  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn  
Burn!

The hills find peace  
Locked armed guard posts  
Safe from the screams  
Of the children born as ghosts  
Gates guns and alarms  
Shape the calm of the dawn  
Peering down into the basin  
Where death lives on  
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate  
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake  
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast  
Of walls deny the terror faced  
By the children born as ghosts  
  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
We're the children born as ghosts  
  
Born as ghosts  
  
One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room  
The school as a tomb  
Where home is a wasteland  
Taste the razor wire  
And thought is locked in the womb  
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream  
Myth of the dream  
Myth of the dream  
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen  
Myth of the dream  
Myth of the dream  
  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
We are the children born as ghosts  
  
Born as ghosts  
Born as ghosts  
  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word  
Born as ghosts  
We're the children born as ghosts  
  
Born as ghosts  
Born as ghosts

My fears hunt me down  
Capturing my memories  
The frontier of loss  
They try to escape across the street where  
Jesus stripped bare  
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture  
In the name of my  
In the name of my  
  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
  
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him  
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within  
His thoughts like a hundred moths  
Trapped in a lampshade  
Somewhere within  
Their wings banging and burning  
On through endless night  
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving  
Praying for someone to turn off the light  
  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
  
My fear is hunting me down  
Capturing my memories  
The frontier of laos  
They try to escape across the street where  
Jesus stripped bare  
And raped the spirit he was supposed to nurture  
In the name of my  
In the name of my  
  
Yeah  
  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, never a broken man  
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

This time the bullet cold rocked ya  
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika  
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda  
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya  
Said it was blue  
When ya blood was read  
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head  
  
Blasted through ya head  
Blasted through ya head  
  
I give a shout out to the living dead  
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized  
So serene on the screen  
You were mesmerized  
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone  
Corporations cold  
Turn ya to stone before ya realize  
They load the clip in omnicolour  
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time  
Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz  
And mutha fuckas lost their minds  
  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
  
Run it!  
  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
  
Checka, checka, check it out  
They load the clip in omnicolour  
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time  
Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz  
And mutha fuckas lost their minds  
  
No escape from the mass mind rape  
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape  
And then play it again and again and again  
Until ya mind is locked in  
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya  
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya  
They say jump and ya say how high  
Ya brain-dead  
Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head  
  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
Just victims of the in-house drive-by  
They say jump, you say how high  
  
Uggh! Yeah! Yea!  
  
Ya standin' in line  
Believin' the lies  
Ya bowin' down to the flag  
Ya gotta bullet in ya head  
  
Ya standin' in line  
Believin' the lies  
Ya bowin' down to the flag  
Ya gotta bullet in ya head  
  
A bullet in ya head  
A bullet in ya head

A bullet in ya head  
A bullet in ya head  
A bullet in ya head  
A bullet in ya head

Come wit it now!

The microphone explodes, shattering the molds  
Either drop tha hits like de la O or get tha fuck off tha commode  
Wit tha sure shot, sure ta make tha bodies drop  
Drop an don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op  
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' tha thirst of tha power dons  
That five sided fist-a-gon  
Tha rotten sore on tha face of mother earth gets bigger  
Tha triggers cold empty ya purse  
  
Rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
  
Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes  
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal  
I walk tha corner to tha rubble that used to be a library  
Line up to tha mind cemetery now  
What we don't know keeps tha contracts alive an movin'  
They don't gotta burn tha books they just remove 'em  
While arms warehouses fill as quick as tha cells  
Rally round tha family, pockets full of shells  
  
Rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
  
Bulls on parade

Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, yo, yo, yo  
  
I be walkin' god like a dog  
My narrative fearless  
My word war returns to burn  
Like Baldwin home from Paris  
Like Steel from a furnace  
I was born landless  
This is tha native son  
Born of Zapata's guns  
Stroll through tha shanties  
And tha cities remains  
Same bodies buried hungry  
But with different last names  
These vultures rob everything  
Leave nothing but chains  
Pick a point on tha globe  
Yes tha pictures tha same  
There's a bank There's a church a myth and a hearse  
A mall and a loan a child dead at birth  
There's a widow pig parrot  
A rebel to tame  
A whitehooded judge  
A syringe and a vein  
  
And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard  
what ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite  
  
This ain't subliminal  
Feel tha critical mass approach horizon  
Tha pulse of tha condemned  
Sound off America's demise  
Tha anti-myth rhythm rock shocker  
Yes I spit fire  
Hope lies in tha smoldering rubble of empires  
Yes back through tha shanties and tha cities remains  
Tha same bodies buried hungry  
But with different last names  
These vultures rob everyone  
Leave nothing but chains  
Pick a point here at home  
Yes tha picture's tha same  
There's a field full of slaves  
Some corn and some debt  
There's a ditch full of bodies  
Tha check for tha rent  
There's a tap, tha phone, tha silence of stone  
Tha numb black screen  
That be feelin' like home  
  
And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what?  
  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite

There's a mass without roofs  
There's a prison to fill  
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills  
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill  
There's a right to obey  
And there's a right to kill  
There's a mass without roofs  
There's a prison to fill  
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills  
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill  
There's a right to obey  
And there's a right to kill

Hey yo!  
Let me be front  
This is real and not a stunt  
I'm comin' to the forefront  
Shovel for the rapper and clear the lane  
'Cause this jam is like a Tomahawk chop  
Teach ya I'll never stop droppin' topics  
Vocal power?  
Yes I got it  
  
On central but their trying to clamp it down  
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it... Down!  
Get down, and at the same time...  
Come up... Down!  
This is a crime that shut us up  
I don't give a fuck  
'Cause the words and the thoughts still hit  
And like I said  
It's not a skit  
Jump another hit  
Yeah  
Ya know I don't need a drum kit  
Make 'em say aw shit!  
The rebellion is true and legit  
  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane  
Down! Get down!... And clear the land  
Down! Get down!... Yeah!  
  
The rebel  
You'll never disable  
Defiance  
With the cards upon the table  
Pulling cards  
Keep the governements in check  
Yo!  
I think we need a new deck  
Never could trust a phillabusta'  
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya  
With words cold hittin' with the underground  
And now you're checkin' out the new sound  
Live hit  
A live pop  
Live rock  
And ya don't stop  
It goes on and on and on  
Who's a threat?  
C'mon, the war is on!  
  
Down! Get down!... And clear the lane [Repeat x 4]  
  
Start droppin'  
Our words are never safe  
Fighting myself  
'Til I'm where I gotta be  
I challenge, don't sweat it  
Now don't you forget it  
Check me? What? Wait  
You better slow down!  
Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat  
I need cash so when I'm cool I'm never ever weak  
Places are fluid and diluted and complete  
Check me once, calm down and take a seat  
Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!  
  
Ugh... Clear the lane [Repeat x 4]  
  
Defiance  
Rippin' up the south set  
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat  
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in  
Timmy see  
Bring that bass in!  
  
Ugh... Clear the lane [Repeat x 4]

Greed  
Causing innocent blood to flow  
Entire culture lost in the overthrow  
They came to see, take whatever they please  
Then all they gave back was death and disease  
  
People were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
AIDS is killing the entire African nation  
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation  
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.  
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation  
  
My peoples' culture was strong and was pure  
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured  
My people were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system  
  
Their minds did slay  
Their souls they cage  
You feel the rage  
This brutality can never be undone  
But the sun has not yet set  
The bass and drums and microphone a threat  
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside  
And see that they're responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
You turn your culture down my throat  
Say I'm inferior when you vomit and choke  
You fill my mind with a false sense of history  
And then you wonder why I have no identity  
  
We'll strike a match and it'll catch  
And spread the insight we need  
A tiny fire burning bright  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed  
  
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed  
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

Are you ready?  
(Ad libbed)  
You think you can tell us what to do You think you can tell us what to  
Wear  
You think that you're better Well you better get ready)  
Bow to the masters...  
Break it down!  
Degenerate into something fool.  
We just got tired of doin what ya told us to do  
That's a brace, boy yeah  
That's a brace, little man  
Break it down  
[Chorus:]  
Degeneration X!  
Degeneration  
Think you can tell me what to do?  
You know who yer talkin to?  
Well you better get used  
To the way the ball bounces  
I see what you got,  
It measures in ounces  
That's a brace, boy, Yeah  
That's a brace, Little Man  
Break it down!  
[Chorus:]  
Think your a big man?  
Ha Ha Ha!  
Treat you like your a little man  
Yo tell me what it's like to be half a man  
It must break your heart  
To see what I am but  
That's a brace, boy  
Yeah  
That's a brace, little man Break it down!  
(Chourus)  
(Degeneration X part doubles)  
Think you can tell me what to do?  
Know who you're talking to?  
Just stop wanting me to be someone else  
Put it away like a book on a shelf  
That you can't read boy, Yeah  
That you can't read Little Man  
Break it down!  
[Chorus:]  
(Repeats and fades towards the end)

Down on the street where the faces shine  
Floatin' around I'm a real low mind  
See a pretty thing in a wall  
See a pretty thing in a wall  
  
In a wall  
In a wall  
In a wall  
  
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love  
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love  
A thousand eyes they look at you  
A thousand eyes they, they look at you  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Oh come on!  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh come on! [Repeat x3]  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Where faces shine  
A real low mind  
Faces shine  
A real low  
  
Oh come on! [Repeat x3]  
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
Bangin' this bolo tight on this solo flight can't fight alone  
Funk tha track my verbs fly like tha family stone  
Tha pen devils set that stage for tha war at home  
Locked wit out a wage ya standin' in tha drop zone  
The clockers born starin' at an empty plate  
Momma's torn hands cover her sunken face  
We hungry but them belly full  
The structure is set ya neva change it with a ballot pull  
In tha ruins there's a network for tha toxic rock  
School yard ta precinct, suburb ta project block  
Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor  
The remains left chained to the powder war  
  
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first  
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yes I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
Bare witness to tha sickest shot while suckas get romantic  
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton  
Still we lampin' still clockin' dirt for our sweat  
A ballots dead so a bullet's what I get  
A thousand years they had tha tools  
We should be takin' 'em  
Fuck tha G-ride I want the machines that are makin' em  
Our target straight wit a room full of armed pawn to  
Off tha kings out tha west side at dawn  
  
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first  
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse  
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
These people ain't seen a brown skin man  
Since their grandparents bought one  
  
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a shotgun  
  
The rungs torn from the ladder can't reach the tumour  
One god, one market, one truth, one consumer  
  
Just a quiet peaceful dance!  
Just a quiet peaceful dance!  
Just a quiet peaceful dance!  
Just a quiet peaceful dance!  
Just a quiet peaceful dance for the things we'll never have  
Just a quiet peaceful dance for the things we don't have

Huh!  
Check it...uggh!  
Silence  
Something about silence makes me sick  
Cause silence can be violent  
Sorta like a slit wrist  
  
If the vibe was suicide  
Then you would push da button  
But if ya bowin' down  
Then let me do the cuttin'  
  
Some speak the sounds  
But speak in silent voices  
Like radio is silent  
Though it fills the air with noises  
Its transmissions bring submission  
As ya mold to the unreal  
And mad boy grips the microphone  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
Yeah and mad mad boy grips the microphone  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
('Cause I know the power of the question)  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
(And I won't stop cause I know the power of the question)  
  
It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins  
If ya will it, I will spill it  
And ya out just as quick as ya came  
Not a silent one  
But a defiant one  
Never a normal one  
Cause I'm the bastard son  
With the visions of the move  
Vocals not to soothe  
But to ignite and put in flight  
My sense of militance  
Groovin', playin' this game called survival  
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival  
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'  
Give ya a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'  
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille  
Mad boy grips the microphone  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
Yeah and mad boy grips the microphone  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
(Cause I know the power of the question)  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
Wit' a fistful of steel  
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)  
Ahh shit  
  
And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question  
  
And if the vibe was suicide  
Then you would push da button  
But if ya bowin' down  
Then let me do the cuttin'  
Yeah!  
Come on!  
  
A .44 full of bullets  
Face full of pale  
Eyes full of empty  
A stare full of nails  
The roulette ball, rolls along on the wheel  
A mind full of fire  
And a fistful of steel  
  
And if the vibe was suicide  
Then you would push da button  
But if ya bowin' down  
Then let me do the cuttin'  
  
Yeah! Wit' a fistful of steel!  
Come on!  
Uggh!  
Wit' a fistful of steel!  
Uggh!

Uggh!  
Pull, pull  
Wuh! (Sung sorta like Michael Jackson)  
Come on!  
Uggh!  
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list  
Al live, never on a floppy disk  
Inka, inka, bottle of ink  
Paintings of rebellion  
Drawn up by the thoughts I think  
  
Yeah!  
Come on!  
The militant poet in once again, check it  
  
It's set up like a deck of cards  
They're sending us to early graves  
For all the diamonds  
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades  
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit  
More like the murals that fit  
Don't turn away  
Get in front of it  
  
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?  
Did ya lose it on the wall  
Playin' tic-tac-toe?  
  
Yo, check the diagonal  
Three brothers gone  
Come on  
Doesn't that make it three in a row?  
  
Spoken quietly: 'Anger is a gift'  
Come on!  
Uggh!  
  
Check that!

Environment  
The environment exceeding on the level  
Of our unconsciousness  
For example  
What does the billboard say  
Come and play, come and play  
Forget about the movement  
  
Spoken quietly: 'Anger is a gift'  
Yeah!

Transmission third world war third round  
Decade of the weapon of sound above ground  
No shelter if you're looking for shade  
I lick shots at the brutal charade  
As the polls close like a casket on truth devoured  
Silent play in the shadow of power a spectacle monopolized  
The camera's eyes on choice disguised  
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?  
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?  
Yes a spectacle monopolized  
They hold the reins, stole your eyes  
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs  
Who stuff the banks and staff the party ranks?  
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord  
None of the above fuck it cut the cord  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Contact I hijacked the frequencies blockin' the beltway  
Move on DC way past the days of bombin' MCs  
Sound off Mumia guan be free  
Who gott 'em yo check the federal file  
All you pendejos know the trial was vile  
Army of pigs try to silence my style  
Off 'em all out that box it's my radio dial  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up

Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable  
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable  
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing  
I Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring  
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that  
Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped  
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em  
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim  
They kept coming, just like I figured  
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas  
What a way to go out, out like a sucker  
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train  
that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing  
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing  
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross  
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast  
Givin best wishes to the best MC  
And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me  
Because I'm housin'

Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco  
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco  
Move  
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco  
Gimme the cue, check one two  
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo  
You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild  
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul  
MC's, you know who you are  
On the bandwagon Why Z? 'cause you a star  
This is the year when the joker's are wild  
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style  
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens  
If it gets wild, then I start cappin  
But for now, since everything's calm  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
Because I'm housin  
'Cause I'm housin

You just need an excuse  
You tell me it calms your nerves  
You just think it looks cool  
  
You tell me you want to be different  
You just change for the same  
You tell me it's only natural  
You just need the proof  
Did you fucking get it?

You tell me that you like her  
You just wish you did  
You tell me that I make no difference

Revolutionary music in our time period. He was a huge influence  
On us and we wanna bring him out right now. So check it out, we  
Got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy. Yeah.  
[Chuck D:] Wassup, wassup! Zack: Yo....  
[x5]  
  
[Chuck D:] "I got a letter from the government  
The other day  
I opened and read it  
It said they were suckers  
They wanted me for their army or whatever  
Picture me given' a damn - I said never  
Here is a land that never gave a damn  
About a brother like me and myself  
Because they never did  
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...  
It occured to me  
The suckers had authority  
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell  
How long has it been?  
They got me sittin' in the state pen  
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before  
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor  
I'm not a fugitive on the run  
But a brother like me begun - to be another one  
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all  
To criticize me for some crime - never the less  
They could not understand that I'm a Black man  
And I could never be a veteran  
On the strength, the situation's unreal  
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel"  
  
Yeah!

Kick Out the Jams, motherfuckers!  
I'm gonna kick 'em out  
  
Well I feel pretty good  
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby  
'Cause we all got in tune  
When the dressing room got hazy now, baby  
  
I know how you want it, child,  
Hot, sweet, and tight  
The girls can't stand it  
When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand  
And then they kick out the jams, yes  
Kick out the jams, I like to kick 'em out  
  
Yes I'm startin' to sweat  
You know my shirt's all wet  
What a feelin'  
And the sound that abounds and  
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling  
You gotta have it, baby  
You can't do without  
When you get the feelin'  
You've got the sounds above  
Put that mic in my hand  
And let me kick out the jams  
Yes, kick out the jams, got to kick 'em out  
  
So you got to get it up  
And then can't get enough  
No you can't get enough, Miss Mackenzie  
'Cause it gets in your brain  
It drives you insane leaping frenzy  
The ...... the faster you funk  
If you want to feed my rocket  
Till the morning comes  
Let me be who I am  
And let me kick out the jams  
Yes kick out the jams  
I done kick 'em out  
  
P.S. Kick OUt the Jams, Motherfuckers! peace, sheena

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.  
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Well, I wake up in the morning  
Fold my hands and pray for rain.  
I got a head full of ideas  
That are drivin' me insane  
It's a shame  
The way she makes me  
Scrub the floor  
I ain't gonna work on, nah  
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Well, he hands you a nickel  
And he hands you a dime  
And he asks you with a grin  
If you're havin' a good time  
Then he fines you every time you slam the door  
I ain't gonna work for, nah  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

To be just like them  
They sing while they slave and just get bored  
I ain't gonna work on, nah  
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Check... 1, 2  
Alright, watch this  
I was born with the voice of a riot, a storm  
Lightning the function, the form,  
Far from the norm I wont follow like cattle I'm more like a catalyst  
Calm in the mix of battle  
Who let the cowboy on a saddle, he don't know a missile from a gavel,  
Para terror troopin flippin loops of death upon innocent flesh, but I'm,  
Back in the cipher my foes and friends with a verse and a pen against a line I
won't toe or defend,  
Instead I curse at the murderous men, in suits of professionals who act like
animals  
Man child, ruthless and wild,  
Who gonna chain this beast back on the leash? This Texas furor for sure-a,
compasionless con who serve a,  
Lethal needle to the poor the cure for, crime, is murder?  
Well, I was born, voice of a riot, a storm  
Lightning the function, the form,  
Far from the norm I wont follow like cattle I'm more like a catalyst  
Calm in the mix of battle  
Who let the cowboy on a saddle, he don't know a missle from a gavel

On the Left, Uhh, On the Left, left, right  
  
(Ok, you're lookin' good, you might just move a little left,  
Just a little left, about 170)  
  
I read the news today, oh boy, a snap shot of a midnight ploy  
Vexed and powerless, devoured by hours, I'm motionless with no rest  
Cause a scream now holds the sky, under another high-tech drive-by  
A lie is a lie is a God, an eagle is a condor of war, and nothing more  
Islam peace, Islam stare into my eyes brother please off our knees  
To beef now we feed their disease, interlocked our hands across seas  
A flag is a rag is a shroud out loud, outside, a faceless crowd  
A cowering child just took their last breath, one snare in the march of death.  
  
Uhh, come on  
Get up  
  
On the Left, On the Left, left, right left  
On the Left, On the Left, left, right left  
On the Left, On the Left, left, right left  
On the Left, Uhh, On the Left, left, right  
  
Here it comes the sound of terror from above  
He flex his Texas twisted tounge  
The poor lined up to kill in desert slums  
For oil that boil beneath the desert sun  
Now we spit flame flip this game  
All the targets are taking aim  
All targets are taking aim  
We're the targets are taking aim

Tha sun ablaze as Maria's foot  
Touches tha surface of sand  
On northern land  
As human contraband  
Some rico from Jalisco  
Passed her name to tha boss  
She stuffed ten to a truckbed  
She clutches her cross  
Here comes tha exhaust  
And it rips through her lungs  
She's off fast to tha pasture  
Like cattle she'll cross  
Degree 106  
Sweat and vomit are thrown  
And she prays and suffocates  
Upon tha memories of home  
Of Yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans  
Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones  
Of graves hidden trapped up in visions of war  
Of nothing no one nobody no more  
These are her mountains and skies and  
She radiates  
Through history's rivers of blood  
She regenerates  
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear  
She's eternally here  
Her time is near  
Never conquered but here  
  
To tear away at tha mask  
  
And now she got a quota  
Tha needle and thread crucifixion  
Sold and shipped across tha new line  
Of Mason Dixon  
Rippin' through denim  
Tha point an inch from her vein  
Tha foreman approach  
His steps now pound in her brain  
His presence it terrifies  
And eclipses her days  
No minutes to rest  
No moment to pray  
And with a whisper  
He whips her  
Her soul chained to his will  
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"  
Her arms jerks  
Tha sisters gather round her and scream  
As if in a dream  
Eyes on tha crimson stream  
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor  
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more  
  
These are her mountains and skies and  
She radiates  
And through history's rivers of blood  
She regenerates  
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear  
Maria she's eternally here  
Her time is near  
Never conquered but here  
  
To tear away at tha mask  
Away at tha mask  
To tear away at tha mask  
  
No minutes to rest  
No moment to pray  
No minutes to rest  
No moment to pray  
No minutes to rest  
It eclipses her day  
Just a moment to pray  
  
Ugh!  
  
To tear away at tha mask, ugh  
Away at tha mask  
To tear away at tha mask  
To tear away at tha mask

Oh Wait a minute now  
Ha ha ha  
Come on  
Wait a Minute Now  
Check  
  
To tha young r to tha e tha b to tha e tha l  
Never give up just live up  
Fed upon America  
We be spittin' it up  
Rippin' it up  
For an even amount in each cup  
To my brothers burning bare feet on black top  
Whose curled 'neath tha shadows  
From tha gaze of tha cops  
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks  
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

Come with tha fire only Marley could catch  
This be tha flame in tha cellar beware  
Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air  
Those naked and wageless

Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes?  
Tha pig who's free to murder one Shucklak  
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?

Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen  
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream  
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated  
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated  
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, " Yes y'all!"  
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small  
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset  
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet  
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab  
So then I add all the rhymes I had  
One after the another one, then I make another one  
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done  
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine  
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?  
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and  
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and  
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of, an addiction,  
Magnetized by the mixing

But back to the problem, I gotta habit  
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit  
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when  
I fiend for a microphone like heroin  
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix  
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix  
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness?  
Beware, it's the reaniamator!  
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon  
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping  
You see a part of me that you never seen  
When I'm fiending for a microphone  
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm  
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one  
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke  
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke  
More than cracked up, you should have backed up  
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a
social experiment  
Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance
and greed  
Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners  
As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my
submission  
I bacame an indentured servant in a factory  
Where I myself was the product  
Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces  
Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me  
  
So that every thought I express  
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks  
And set fire to their homes

Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong  
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn  
  
Spirit of Jackson now scream from the ruins  
Through factory chains and the ghost of the union  
Forgotten remains disappear to the new home  
Knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone  
  
Blood on the floor but the tear is still dryin'  
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'  
Cell block, live stock, the bodies, they buyin'  
Old South order, new northern horizon  
  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd

Yo, yo, check the high tech terror, it's the new order athletes  
Peer into the eyes of the child already on trial  
All this rippin' families apart, get 'em on file  
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while  
  
Films of dogs ripping through homes, ripping skin from bones  
Yes, the new millennium homes  
Or privatizing through private eyes and an era rising  
Of the Old South order, new northern horizon  
  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd

We're the renegades of this time and age  
This is the time and age of renegades  
Renegades of this time and age  
This is the time and age of renegades  
  
Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece  
Right down through the Middle Ages  
Planet earth kept going through changes  
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change  
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades  
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine  
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X  
They were renegades of their time and age  
The mighty renegades  
  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
  
From a different solar system many many galaxies away  
We are the force of another creation  
A new musical revelation  
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen  
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like  
Zulu nation  
  
Revelations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
  
Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies  
They change the course of history  
Everyday people like you and me  
We're the renegades we're the people

Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'  
Poppin', sockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop  
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'  
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop  
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop  
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop  
  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
We're the renegades of funk  
  
We're teachers of the funk  
And not of empty popping  
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics  
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals  
'Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh  
  
There was a time when our music  
Was something called the Big Street beat  
People would gather from all around  
To get down to the big sound  
You had to be a renegade those days  
To take a man to the dance floor

His spit is worth more than her work

Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?  
Revolver!

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home  
Hatred passed on, passed on and passed on  
A world of violent rage  
But it's one that I can recognize  
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes  
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip  
I tried to grip my family  
But I slipped  
  
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane  
I gotta nine, a sign, a set and now I gotta name  
  
Read my writing on the wall  
No-one's here to catch me when I fall  
Death is on my side, suicide!

The world is my expense  
The cost of my desire  
Jesus blessed me with its future  
And I protect it with fire  
So raise your fists  
And march around  
Don't dare take what you need  
I'll jail and bury those committed  
And smother the rest in greed  
Crawl with me into tomorrow  
Or I'll drag you to your grave  
I'm deep inside your children  
They'll betray you in my name  
  
Sleep now in the fire  
  
The lie is my expense  
The scope of my desire  
The Party blessed me with its future  
And I protect it with fire  
I am the Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria  
The noose and the rapist  
And the fields overseer  
The agents of orange  
The priests of Hiroshima  
The cost of my desire  
  
Sleep now in the fire  
  
For it's the end of history  
It's caged and frozen still  
There is no other pill to take  
So swallow the one  
That made you ill  
The Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria  
The noose and the rapist  
The fields overseer  
The agents of orange  
The priests of Hiroshima  
The cost of my desire  
  
Sleep now in the fire

Satellites and, pair of mirrors and, and a man without a home  
With a horse, and a rider, and a clever, cunning killer  
Silent in error and vocal in spotlights  
Lying always sucking on a bottle of, that sweet, indulgent fluid  
Oh greed oh yes oh greed oh yes!  
Oh greed oh yes  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Your friendship is a fog  
That disappears when the wind redirects  
You!  
Yes you!  
  
Father's expectations, soul soaked in, spit and urine  
And you gotta make it where?  
To a sanctuary that's a fragile American hell  
An empty dream  
A selfish, horrific vision  
Passed on like the deadliest of viruses  
Crushing you and your naive profession  
Have no illusions boy  
Vomit all ideals and serve  
Sleep and wake and serve  
And don't just think just wake and serve  
Yeah!  
Yeah! (Left channel - 26 years in this stage  
Yeah! you're 26 years in this stage)  
Yeah!  
Your friendship is a fog  
That disappears when the wind redirects  
You! Interested in you, interested in you  
Interested in you, interested in you

Well what can a poor boy do  
For sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
In this sleepy L.A. town  
There's just no place for  
For a street fighting man  
  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
A street fighting man

In the right light, study becomes insight  
But the system that dissed us  
Teaches us to read and right  
So called facts are fraud  
They want us to allege and pledge  
And bow down to their God  
Lost the culture, the culture lost  
Spun our minds and through time  
Ignorance has taken over  
Yo, we gotta take the power back!  
Bam! Here's the plan  
Motherfuck Uncle Sam  
Step back, I know who I am  
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear  
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear  
The rage is relentless  
We need a movement with a quickness  
You are the witness of change  
And to counteract  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah, we gotta take the power back  
Come on, come on!  
We gotta take the power back  
  
The present curriculum  
I put my fist in 'em  
Eurocentric every last one of 'em  
See right through the red, white and blue disguise  
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies  
Installed in our minds and attempting  
To hold us back  
We've got to take it back  
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears  
One-sided stories for years and years and years  
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?  
Yeah, we need to check the interior  
Of the system that cares about only one culture  
And that is why  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah, we gotta take the power back  
Come on, come on!  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Hey yo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it,  
break it down  
Aw shit!  
Ugh!  
And like this Ugh!  
Come on, yeah! Bring it back the other way!  
  
The teacher stands in front of the class  
But the lesson plan he can't recall  
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies  
Bouncing off every fucking wall  
His composure is well kept  
I guess he fears playing the fool  
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that  
Bullshit that he learned in school  
Europe ain't my rope to swing on  
Can't learn a thing from it  
Yet we hang from it  
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then  
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen  
To expose and close the doors on those who try  
To strangle and mangle the truth  
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah, we gotta take the power back  
Come on, come on!  
We gotta take the power back  
  
No more lies  
Ugh!  
Yeah!  
  
Take it back y'all  
Take it back, a-take it back  
A-take it back y'all, come on!  
Take it back y'all  
Take it back, a-take it back  
A-take it back y'all, come on!  
  
Ugh!  
Yeah!

Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
I can see you in front of me, front of me  
Ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
Why don't you get from in front of me?  
Oh she's got everyone's eyes  
Yeah!  
In every home there's a sickening distress  
Yeah!  
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one  
But we're all gonna, nah we're already dead!  
We're already dead!  
  
And those colorful words for tha Laos frontiers-man  
Who passed away with the truth  
Amidst the eulogies of bliss  
Who will know now what I know about you?  
Now that history's a flowery cancerous mess  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me  
A mess!  
Overbearing yes ya tryin' ta tire me  
A mess!  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
So get the fuck from in front of me  
Nah let's see it broken, bloody and undressed!  
We're already dead!  
  
In a violent time (?)  
  
I want to be Jackie Onassis  
I want to wear a pair of dark sunglasses  
I want to be Jackie O  
Oh oh oh oh please don't die!  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
I can see you in front of me, front of me  
Ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
Why don't you get from in front of me?  
Ruh!  
We're already dead!  
We're already dead!  
We're already dead!

Rebel, rebel and yell  
'Cause our people still dwell in hell  
Locked in a cell  
Yes, the structure's a cell  
Mad is the story I tell  
How long can we wait?  
Come on, seein' what's at stake  
Action for reaction  
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state  
Get a check up  
This is a stick up  
Our freedom or your life  
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful  
But there can be no sequel  
Now freedom must be fundamental  
In Johannesburg or South Central  
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em  
To kick in the township rebellion  
  
Yeah, what about that, sucker? Unh  
  
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hard lines  
That fill your mind  
Thoughts, battles fought  
And lessons taught  
Yes I'll display the fitness  
And flip like a gymnast  
Raise my fist and resist  
Asleep, though we stand in the midst  
Of a war  
Gotta get mine  
Gotta get more  
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm  
'Cause what does it offer me?  
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin  
  
Gotta get wreck  
Till our necks never swing on a rope  
From here to the cape of no hope  
  
Now freedom must be fundamental  
In Johannesburg or South Central  
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em  
To kick in the township rebellion  
  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
  
What's it gonna take?  
  
Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost  
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost  
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost  
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost, lost!  
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross!  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost!  
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross!  
When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost!  
  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform?  
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Shock around tha clock, from noon 'til noon

Thrown from tha throat, new cages an scapegoats

Check out tha new style that Ollie found

Check tha heads bow in vietnow  
Shut down tha devil sound

Every official that comes in  
Cripples us leaves us maimed  
Silent and tamed  
And with our flesh and bones  
He builds his homes  
Southern fist  
Rise through tha jungle mist  
Clenched to smash power so cancerous  
A black flag and a red star  
A rising sun loomin' over los angeles  
Cause for raza livin in la la  
Is like gaza on to tha dawn of intifada  
Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on  
And seize tha metropolis  
It's you that it's built on  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
And everything changed on a new years day, come on  
  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land!  
  
Their existence is a crime  
Their seat their robe their tie  
Their land deeds  
Their hired guns  
They're tha crime  
Shots heard underground round tha rapture  
Tha world's eye captured  
At last in a Mexican pasture  
Tha masked screaming land or death  
Within a breath  
A war from tha depth of time  
Who shot four puppet governors in a line  
Who shook all tha world bankers  
Who think they can rhyme  
Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine  
Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time  
  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
And everything can change on a new years day, come on  
  
Oh, hear the masked scream
