All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
It's amazing how everything turns out so right  
You were lost, now you're found by the love, by the life  
That you kindely meet it's time you're near  
Gonna love you the way I'm created to do  
  
All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
Can you show me that stone? Can you tell me that rock?  
That is larger than us and can move what is right?  
No coincidence I'm in love with you  
Gonna love you the way I'm created to do  
  
Oh oh oh believe me  
  
Believe me when all hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me

She leads a lonely life  
She leads a lonely life  
  
When she woke up late in the morning  
Light and the day had just begun  
She opened up her eyes and thought  
O' what a morning  
It's not a day for work  
It's a day for catching sun  
Just laying on the beach and having fun  
She's going to get you  
  
All that she wants is another baby  
She's gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
All that she wants is another baby  
She's gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
  
All that she wants, all that she wants  
  
So if you are in sight and the day is right  
She's a hunter you're the fox  
The gentle voice that talks to you  
Won't talk forever  
It's a night for passion  
But the morning means goodbye  
Beware of that is flashing in her eyes  
She's going to get you  
  
All that she wants

I know that I'm not the first one  
You have love in your path before me  
But when your lips touched my lips  
It felt like I was kissing destiny  
  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
  
'Cause I can see the things  
I really want to see  
I'm in love  
I believe in what I'm feeling  
  
I'd give everything up just for you  
Love is devoted to those who see  
That the last dance, you dance with the truth  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
'Cause I can see the things  
  
I really want to see  
In your eyes  
Angel eyes just want you here to hold me  
Angel eyes

Is there something about you  
That I don't already know?  
Something about me  
That'll make you break my heart and go?  
Been through it all  
More than a thousand times  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
You say you're looking for someone  
From a cover of a magazine  
Romance and beauty  
But it isn't always what it seems  
Look into my eyes  
My tears won't lie  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my legendary love  
  
Wo-ooh  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way  
Ooh yeah, yeah  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way  
  
She's got to be  
She's got to be  
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)  
She's got to be  
She's got to be  
  
(Wo-ooh, wo-ohh, yeah)  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
(Legendary love)  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Wo-ooh ohh-ho

You can do what you want just seize the day  
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way  
Don't you ever consider giving up  
You will find, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
  
Take a walk in the park when you feel down  
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up  
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child  
Such a dream, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
  
You're looking for somewhere to belong  
You're standing all alone  
For someone to guide you on your way  
Now and forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to be anybody  
  
We're living in different ways  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you to a place  
I've never been before oh yeah  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away  
With you tonight  
  
[Chorus]

What a beautiful morning  
The best in life is free  
  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a mystery  
Though the world's on fire  
Yesterday's hard words is still in my head  
I feel no despair  
No regrets or sorrows  
Cause this new day  
Makes me dance on air  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
The shadows fading out  
  
As the day grows bright  
We are turning pages  
And we write new chapters of our life  
Some are strong and long  
Others weak with sorrows  
Keep the focus on the rising sun  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
Shadows fading out  
  
Believe me crows will always fly  
Believe me they are only birds  
You have to  
You have to let go and you will see things in a different light  
  
What a beautiful morning  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a beautiful  
What a beautiful morning  
  
Believe me

Reality reality reality is always  
You tattooed yourself what a piece of art  
You've already broken your mother's heart  
When I was your age working my ass off  
Your generation's soft  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
What's keeping her from searching  
You cannot pierce that and  
You're dressed too tight  
  
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right  
So dye you hair, dad's gonna wash it out  
Come on wash out your mouth  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
What's hiding in the shadow  
Reality reality reality is always  
Reality is always

(Was actually sung by Unique ii)  
  
Last night I had the strangest dream,  
I sailed away to China, in a little row boat to find ya,  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didn't want no one to hold you what does that mean? And you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my break my stride,  
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride,  
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
  
You're on the road and now you pray it's gone  
The road behind was rocky, but now you're feelin' cocky.  
You look at me and you see your past.  
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast and you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never let another girl like you work me over  
Never let another girl like you drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you have to say oh  
  
(chorus)(2x)  
  
Repeat till fades

Captain Nemo is too good for you and me  
Take a voyage to the bottom of the sea  
He's a riddle you will see in the middle of the sea  
If you ask him things about life, then he will say:  
  
Oh no, I'm far too continental for mankind  
I don't interfere in your life  
See me as a searcher with the answers  
To your world from under the sea  
  
Captain Nemo knows the world be we don't know  
What control of light and darkness means  
He'll show  
If we come in peace at heart  
He may help us to restart what went wrong  
So long ago from down below  
  
Oh no, I'm far too continental for mankind  
I don't interfere in your life  
See me as a searcher with the answers  
To your world from under the sea  
  
See him as a searcher with the answers to mankind  
He's far too continental  
Though he's wiser than all man  
He is curious about the plan  
Violated by the man, the master plan  
  
Oh no, he's far too continental for mankind  
He doesn't interfere in your life  
See him as a searcher with the answers  
To your world from under the sea  
  
Oh no, he's far too continental for mankind  
He doesn't interfere in your life  
See him as a searcher with the answers  
To your world from under the sea  
  
Oh no, he's far too continental for mankind  
Under the sea

I am as young as I'm feeling  
I'm always 21, I am always 21  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
I'm always 21 at heart, love listen to me  
Ooooh yeah yeah yeah  
I need somebody to stay beside me  
Cause I've got a hungry heart  
Baby with or without love  
I'm gonna get a man who can fulfill my dreams  
On the top of the world I don't wanna be alone  
No no no not me  
  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On the road tonight  
Life is good for you, always 21  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On my own tonight  
Life is good for you, always 21  
  
Love is a lyer, but I'm a tryer,  
Give it another go  
You have another, yes I have seen her,  
I wonder who she is  
Does she kiss you the way  
That I used to kiss you  
I bet she wonders  
Who I am  
  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On the road tonight  
Life is good for you, always 21  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie

Life is good for you, always 21  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On my own tonight  
Love will come to you  
You are always 21  
  
I get older everyday  
But I will fight it till the end  
There's a man for me to have and to hold  
Easy come and easy go  
Once bitten but not for long  
And as young as I'm feeling  
Yes I am  
  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On my own tonight  
Love will come to you  
You are always 21  
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie  
On my own tonight  
Life is good for you, always 21  
You are always 21  
  
Always, always, always  
Life is good for you you are always 21

Change in the light  
Change with the light - turn turn turn around  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Smile on my face like Dr. Jekil and Mr. Hide

Excited by your beauty, makes me pull up a blind  
Hypnotized ? it's up my mind  
  
All the voices, I can't resist my inside  
All the choices that the daylight brings  
Like a diamond, sparkling and shining  
All the hours

Change in the light, change in the light

(Dance Music Playing)  
  
You're looking through my face  
Why don't you notice me  
I'm hungry  
People are passing by  
Exchanging glances  
Promising more to  
  
Come in the nights to come  
You are my date but you don't know it  
Me and myself and I are going to get you  
Sooner or later  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
I got a lot to give,  
And I'm gonna give a lot my baby  
I got a lot to give  
I'm giving you my love  
I'm giving you my love  
  
Standing here all alone  
Going through all our levels now  
I'm changing the highest one  
Commitments to follow  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours

With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
I'm a stranger in the night  
Without you all alone  
I'm dancing with myself  
  
It's a long way yet to go  
I'm longing for your touch  
To hold you forever on  
And on and on and on  
  
Come come to me, come come to me  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come come to me, come come to me

With you I'm feeling free

Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning  
I sit around  
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry  
Strange voices are saying (ah, what did they say)  
Things I can't understand  
It's too close for comfort  
This heat has got right out of hand  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
It's a cruel  
  
The city is crowded, my friends are away, and I'm on my own  
It's too hot to handle so I gotta get up and go, and go  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
It's a cruel  
  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Come on, come on  
  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Come on, come on  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
Leaving me here on my own (leaving me here all alone)  
  
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
(Don't leave me, leave me in this summer)  
You're not the only one (you're not the only one)  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
(You're not the only one at home)  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one (it's a cruel summer)  
Cruel summer (cruel summer)  
It's a cruel summer (it's a cruel)  
Cruel summer (cruel summer)  
It's a cruel summer

Chorus:  
Cuba, cuba here I come  
There's a place in the caribbean sun  
Land of future  
Land of dreams  
Checking for the coast  
  
Cuban cigars  
And the last glass in the bar  
I see the rise and the fall  
Of this down, downtown miami  
Give me someone to dance with and love  
When the sun goes down  
While Fidel is growing his hair  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
(It's Ace of base)  
Cuba, cuba libre  
Uh huh  
  
(Shock)  
  
Share in the sun  
Givin' us some taps  
That's still the one  
Where coca cola and coke  
Have arrived for consumers  
It's so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people, the nature  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
In the sun, in the south  
(It's Ace of base)  
Cuba, cuba libre  
Uhmm ah ahh  
  
Cuba, cuba libre  
The world is coming over to ya,to ya  
(x4)  
  
(Chorus x 2)  
  
It's so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people, the nature

Da capo  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
  
One level ahead  
I'm calling to you  
But touch you I cannot do  
To tell you I can't  
I'm drawing the line  
To greetings to understand  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
  
Da da capo  
Once again  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
I'm longing to see  
The offspring of me  
To hold it with my bare hands  
So talk about me as you used to do  
I'm with you from time to time  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
With your deeds all the time  
  
Da da capo  
Once again  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
Da da capo  
Once again (woo hoo yeah)  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
  
Once again (woo hoo yeah)  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
Da da capo

What an odd situation  
What you got is basic emotions  
Can you feel them  
I want to be your lover  
But you're so shy  
What you need is perfect assistance  
Let me guide you  
To a land you're never seen before  
  
I guess you see  
I have another daydream  
I guess you see  
That I have another daydream  
  
Come and be a dancer  
Dance into my daydream  
Join me in my daydream wet and wild  
  
Come and be a dancer  
Dance into my daydream  
Join me in my jungle wet and wild  
  
To help another person  
Will make you feel important  
You got my invitation  
But you're so shy  
Come and let your wild side show  
And be a dancer  
A dancer in a daydream we can share  
  
I guess you see  
  
Help me take control  
Of my full imagination  
I'm looking for a man  
Who will watch my situation  
I'm thinking about the people  
Waiting down the line  
I am the limelight now's my time  
  
I guess you see  
  
What you gonna do I'm a bold explosion

Verse. 1:  
  
Rappin on a dead mic, hot lyrics comin from me  
People thinks i'ma sic, nah i'm just tha shy A-Double-B  
Remanissin yesterday i was holdin ma hennessey  
Roled and got shot, what happend to hiphop  
Tha hood is cold, everybody's findin someone to kill  
Fuckas don't know how i feel, poor childrens need some meal  
Lets find tha one who can heal, i'm tryna take care ma family  
Fightin for tha fame luvin this rap game  
Damn that's ma fantisy, but everybody's sayin to me that  
School is nessecery, makin music is a secondery  
I'm thinkin about stoppin? but many says i should fight?  
Shiit, i'm rappin on a dead mic  
  
Chours.  
  
In Tha Hood,  
Some Say I'm Good,  
Some Say I'm Bad,  
Some don't Say That,  
And, Some Say I'ma Sic,  
That's Because,  
I'm Rappin On A Dead Mic  
  
Verse. 2:  
  
Abbaz Chiyad, Tha one that never gon change  
Cant stop makin music, lyrics comin to me like i'm nobody strange  
Tryin to be famous, it's only ma life that is'nt glarious  
Tryin to be good, tryin to forget that time wer A-Double-B  
Was blowin up he's enemies in tha hood  
New Kid On Tha Glock brought me up, started rappin on beats from Shownuff  
You remember me, from Rais to Outlaw  
New album (Guess Whos Back), that's what i'ma bout more  
Even if death come to me, i aint got nothin to fear  
And i know there's gon happend some wrong this year  
Now haters wanna get along, from today till tha day i die  
I'm gon live strong  
  
Chours.  
  
In Tha Hood,

Verse. 3:  
  
Nobody can stop tha music and tha hood need rap  
Fuck them bitches sayin it's crap  
We raised up for a rapper, like Pac  
Rest in peace but still he rock  
Niggaz think i don't got something to say, so listen here  
Everyday i'm workin tryin to make ma songs pay  
I just wanna be heard, fuckas don't let me earn mine  
When you're a bad boy haters don't wanna see you shine  
So much pressure in this life of mine  
I cry times, Allah please show me tha right sign  
There's no one i can find, i smoked and got high  
I think i did it for maintain  
Now i just wanna be with ma homies if some of em remains  
I can't ride, i can only see that tha rain is fallin in ma eyes  
  
Chours.  
  
In Tha Hood,  
Some Say I'm Good,  
Some Say I'm Bad,  
Some don't Say That,  
And, Some Say I'ma Sic,  
That's Because I'm Rappin On A Dead Mic

Donnie's got a secret and you know it  
He was yours, in the summertime, yeah  
About ten years ago  
He promised you to stay forever  
Live with you  
It's so bittersweet now  
When you know what you lost  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend: tender, sexy, sweet and  
Blond  
  
He's always on your mind  
The season changes  
Years went by  
But that chapter of love stays unfinished for you  
  
Keep on dancing through your new life  
Maybe, make a move  
Make him see you again,  
As the flower you are  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend, tender, sexy, sweet and  
Blond  
  
In the summer time, yeah  
In the summer time, life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
In the summer time, yeah  
In the summer time, life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side

One step hesitation  
One step into the night  
Don't mind the weather  
It's raining in my heart tonight  
  
Much more to living  
Two wrongs don't make a right  
You're gonna regret it  
When you're looking back  
On your life  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Some dream of fortune  
Others dream of fame  
Seconds after leaving  
Life'll never be the same  
  
Fell for temptation  
It didn't mean a thing  
We'll last forever  
If you turn around  
Once again  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Do you wanna be more than a picture hanging on the wall  
Something to remind me of how it all went wrong  
Do you wanna be more than a number forgotten in a book  
You're holding something special, so take another look  
  
You're gonna regret it  
When you're looking back  
On your life  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Take a look  
Take another look on your way  
Take a look  
Take another look on your way  
  
Please don't go

If you want to leave  
I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling  
Maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door  
Yea see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me  
Holding me tight  
If you ever think about me  
Just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive  
Sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I wish I could scream out loud  
That I love you  
I wish I could say to you  
Don't go  
  
As he walks away he feels the pain  
Getting strong  
People in your life they don't know what's  
Going on  
Too proud to turn around he's gone  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know

I see dark clouds out my window  
I know the storm is coming any minute  
And the thunder just confirms my fears  
And I know the tears are in it  
I'll be cryin' unable to stop  
Look here comes the very first drop  
  
'Cause every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
Darlin' I am still in love with you  
As time passes by it just intensifies  
I know I'll never be with you again  
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes  
I'll be trying unable to stop  
Look here comes the very first drop  
  
'Cause every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
On sunny days I'm all right  
I walk in the light  
And I try not to think about  
The love I live without  
  
But every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
'Cause every time it rains (every time it rains)  
I fall to pieces (every memory)  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains (every time it rains)  
I get wet  
  
'Cause every time it rains (every time it rains)  
I fall to pieces (every memory)  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains (every time it rains)  
I get wet

Give me all your tears  
Let me turn them into pearls  
Let me turn all the tears  
That you've cried into pearls  
Hand them to me, I'm gonna keep  
  
Keep them for you  
I want to hold you,  
I want to kiss you  
I want to mend what is broken.  
  
Love me the way that you loved her, please  
Cause now I'm giving it all,  
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be  
Yours this time, I'm gonna give what I've got,  
And get your love in return.  
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be  
Yours this time, I'm gonna teach you to trust  
And learn how to burn,  
Experience pearls  
Pearls of experience  
When sand strikes up in your eyes  
I will cover your face.  
  
I'll plant your desert with roses,  
And I'm gonna keep, keep them for you.  
And so I've made up my mind  
  
I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver  
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin.  
I'd tear myself apart just to get you,  
And so I've made up my mind  
  
And so I've made up my mind

I'm kinda lost now  
Don't intervening, no meaning  
I have no cause now  
My heart is bleeding a tiny bit  
And it goes now  
I'm only bleeding at you and me  
Can be awesome  
But that's not realistic  
Pain that you've inflected  
It's so wicked  
I'm addicted  
You're the place of shifted  
Ain't no try to get physical  
I just wanna know  
Do you still wearing lipstick?  
You're so cryptic  
If You've lost my drug  
And you've got me lifted  
Just one night come at the...  
We can just be friends  
And we'll hold hands  
And dance until the night ends  
And I'll run the engines... Engines  
And I'll let you finish all my sentences  
You right here right now  
Girl that's a blessing  
Just one night  
We should learn some lessons  
Looking so flatted while you're dressing  
Like this we can guess them all  
Get them all like a festival  
But the rush you go  
I'm steady you just wanna pay  
Can't breathe like I'm living in space  
I'mma... With ace  
I'mma being mistakes  
Cause my life is a chase  
And I'm in the race  
See that you wanna to taste  
... My hand won't waste  
I don't care what they say  
I wasn't really looking at you  
But they say you were here  
With that dude  
Is it true?  
I've been captured  
We've been running like patrol  
Don't count that  
When the... That  
It's about that  
It's a trick right there  
Little home you shout that  
Going down rewind that  
We're going up right now  
  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
  
Dance  
  
Oh look girl look some precious  
All I see is true pics and restless  
Well I guess is I have to leave  
Till I have intrigue... Something I can't believe  
Believe it's like Jesus

Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
  
Coming from my work I'm tired  
I see you get on my bus  
Here I go again, a new attraction  
And I think I know you  
Something is familiar 'bout your face  
I move through the crowd so I can get a better look  
  
Hello hello  
I got what you're looking for  
Hello hello  
Can't you see me, hello  
Hello  
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart  
Can't you see me I'm here  
Beside you  
  
Weren't you the one who  
Spilled my long drink over at a bar  
Easy come, easy go I said and laughed  
Looking like a question mark you  
Stood there wondering what to do  
And I said to you "Don't you look to happy now"  
  
Hello hello...  
Hello hello  
Here I'm standing next to you  
Hello Hello  
I am an object, nothing new  
Talk to me you're looking strange  
Let me know if my presence is bothering you  
  
Hello Hello  
Everybody's looking  
How can't you see me  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's searching  
How can't you see me  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's looking  
How can't you see  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's searching  
How can't you see me  
  
Ahh...

Can't you hear them whispering  
Around you all the time  
Can't you tell the difference between  
Things when you're in love  
I hear your voice is trembling  
Every time when he's around  
Your detached engagements  
In the things I say means love, oh  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
If he doesn't love you, you're afraid that you  
Can't go on  
Living without loving never makes a person  
Strong, no  
If he really loves you, let him show you that  
Instead  
I will be here with you 'cause I know that  
You're afraid of love  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
You'll never change my mind my friend, don't  
Let that feeling go  
This love might change your world around  
In time you'll have to know, oh yeah  
  
Whether you should go  
  
Oh yeah  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
Whether you should be happy  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
  
He decides  
Whether you  
  
I know that  
He decides

I enter your life now make no mistake  
Can you reach me can you reach me  
I enter your life now make no mistake  
Can you reach me can you touch me  
  
[Chorus]  
Can you hear me calling in the night  
My love's so strong I can't get it right  
Can you feel my longing through the night  
You've got me totally hypnotized  
  
I came in a black dress and left in a white  
Can you reach me can you reach me  
I came in a black dress and left in a white  
Can you reach me can you touch me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looking for eyes, the dream is so nice  
The rhythm of the song, where you belong  
I want is your heart and soul  
  
Hm, I'm high on emotion you're here with me  
You cam reach me you can reach me  
Hm, I'm high on emotion you're here with me  
You cam reach me you can touch me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hypnotized I am hypnotized

When I was young I dreamed about  
Oh so many places  
When I was young I never thought I'd be afraid  
The years go by and with them comes  
Oh so many changes  
You know what I mean  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
And in my youth I realized nothing lasts forever  
I find myself remembering those happy days  
Follow me, I'll show you all the colors of the rainbow  
You know what I mean  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
Don't wait, don't be late  
You don't have a second left to hesitate  
Walk, talk, do it all  
Nothing you can do will break the fall  
  
Turn and turn  
Tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind  
If you want to be free  
Be there  
Turn around expectations  
Say 'goodbye' to complications  
Be there, be there  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
I pray  
I pray  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
I pray  
I pray  
I pray there's another day  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray

Into the night of blue, into the night of blue...  
  
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Still thinking 'bout you  
Haven't seen a smile upon my face  
And I haven't slept a night for days  
I go, I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
  
In my mind are pictures of the past  
Telling me a story meant to last  
Still holding onto  
Days out on the beach out in the sun  
Nights when I was still your only one  
Now I go, I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
  
Funny how these memories  
Only lead me back to you  
They lead me back to you  
I go, I go...  
  
Into the night of blue...  
  
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Now I go, I go...  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue, into the night of blue  
  
Into the night of blue, into the night of blue

Juliet  
A girl you never should have met  
Oh, Juliet  
She acted like she's never seen your face before  
It's not funny honey when you try  
And she's not even willing to learn  
It's not funny honey when you're only after money  
Could you ever try to earn?  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Howzat!  
What's up a bright and clear new summer day  
Well, Howzat!  
Wake up and breath the air and sail away  
So, Howzat!  
What's up now, don't you worry night and day  
Always remember, don't you remember me? Yeah  
  
Juliet,  
How could she ever you forget  
Oh, Juliet  
She acted like she's never seen your face before  
It's not funny honey when you try  
And she's not even willing to learn  
It's not funny honey when you're on your own  
And the pages never turn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never meant to hurt you  
But that's just the way it went  
It's not my intention  
Pretending to be Heaven Saint  
Juliet, what's up a bright and clear new summer day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Juliet

I'm driving through the night  
I'm driving through the rain  
The engine roars I'm on my way  
Away from Mr. Pain  
  
My eyes keep seeing what  
My mind wants to forget  
Those sequences they  
Rock 'n' Roll inside my head  
  
Over and over and over again  
I concentrate harder and harder and then  
You are just an image  
(that I can't see)  
  
You are not for real  
You turn into a picture of somebody  
Someone I don't know  
Someone I don't feel  
  
(just an)  
The wolves cry out tonight  
I see your broken line  
The sun will rise without  
  
A love without a smile  
I always think about  
The way you had to leave  
I close my eyes  
  
'Cause I was with you  
By that time  
Faster and faster and faster-ahead  
As if you were waiting  
  
For my down the way  
I have never seen you  
Lying on a floor  
Crying needing more  
(just an)

La la l'amour  
Gotta a lotta la la l'amour  
La la l'amour  
  
La la l'amour all for you  
Say you want it, la la l'amour  
La la l'amour  
  
We took in the sights at the great museum  
We kissed in the garden next to our Notre Dame  
Just seconds to go to the new millenium  
Got something now to live for  
  
La la l'amour  
Gotta a lotta la la l'amour  
La la l'amour  
  
La la l'amour all for you  
Say you want it, la la l'amour  
La la l'amour  
  
We got us a good 'Eyefull' at the tower  
And down at the river we fell deep in love  
We turned out this night Now it's ours forever  
Now we've got something to die for

Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing  
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down  
  
You're living your life in peace and in harmony  
You making your own decisions  
That's how it's got to be for you and me  
So many people are running around and 'round  
Without no sense of logic  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger

Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing  
You can do what you want  
You can live in a dream  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm,get down  
  
Keep moving your feet  
Don't go wasting your time  
Everybody's moving, yeah they're getting in line  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger  
  
People are the same today as they used to be  
The same expectations  
So high no one can reach that high  
Not I nor you get satisfied today  
We'll never get enough  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa

Oh so much danger, oh so much danger  
Look into the eyes of a stranger,  
In the eyes of a stranger,  
You'll be living, in danger

Look around me, look at what I've found Credits  
Look around me, look at what I've found  
People come and people go  
And that's the way it is ,  
What does it really matter  
About twenty years after?  
Specialise, we modernise  
Make changes day to day  
One day up and one day down  
Let's call it fashion  
  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
You know the city-slicks and politics  
Now they don't bother me  
As long as there's no ration  
Of love and passion  
Be cool, be kind  
But don't be blind  
To all the love I'm giving  
Don't waist a minute  
Get into living  
  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
Don't wait, don't be late  
You don't have a second left to hesitate  
Walk, talk, do it all  
Nothing you can do will ever break the fall  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
They're looking at me  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
They're looking at me  
  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found

We had a million of days  
I know that our time has run out  
You're my everlasting groove  
Forget the past for the time to come  
In all our thoughts and will meet again  
Never leave me out here in the cold I say  
For my never ending dream  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion,  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
What's left of the magic  
  
We had a million of days  
I know that our time has run out  
You're my everlasting groove  
Forget the past for the time to come  
In all our thoughts and we will meet again  
Never leave me out here in the cold I say  
For my never ending dream  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion,  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
What's left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime  
  
Cause there's a place in the world  
I know where I rather would be  
In the fairy tales of love  
Where everything has a happy end  
A world my friend  
In fantasia-land  
We will be together all the time my dear  
In the fairytales of love  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion,  
Fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
What's left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime  
  
For a moment a touch you feel  
Like a vision of an angel  
As our love, undecided disappears forever  
Always longing to have you NEAR  
Fell the power and the passion  
Feel me slipping from your hands  
Please break my fall  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion,  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
What's left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime

Life is a paradise...whoa oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven  
I know, I know  
'Cause I've been there with you tonight  
  
I believe life could be paradise once again...  
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within  
Close your eyes it's something for you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I'm a prisoner of hope  
I know  
  
We are young and we are old  
We're fallin' like leaves, like leaves...  
And your heart's so full of soul  
It makes me believe  
Once again, it's something for you...  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
A bridge over time  
Was what you need to see the light, to see the light  
Oh yeah  
Lucky love, lucky love  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven...  
  
[Chorus x2]

My deja vu, you're my obsession  
my deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
We'll get the magic back again  
  
My deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
I want to see you dancing naked  
I want to see you touch the moon  
  
But when I try to reach your fingers  
You just vanish into air  
I want to feel you with my senses  
'Cause I'm almost sure the texture  
  
Of your skin  
is gonna tell me who you are  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
  
My deja vu  
I want to hold you like I used to  
I want to feel you in my blood  
I wonder why I do confess this  
  
To myself all the time  
I know the time is working against us  
But I'll long for you the rest of my whole life  
Like a prisoner of hope  
  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
I have tried to get to know you  
To get you off my mind  
  
It feels like going back in time  
And snap, I see your figure once again  
My deja vu everything is up to you  
If you do want me you know where to search  
  
My deja vu you're my obsession  
My deja vu it's always you  
My deja vu you're my obsession

Ah  
ah ha ha ah  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
But you're sleeping on my arm  
I'm longing to wake you up  
  
I want it simple  
I have travelled around the world  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out  
Now it's you and me  
And we take it from here and now  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
  
Would I lie, would I lie  
To something so obvious to myself  
I'm wanting you day and night  
I see your smile  
Whe you're waking up here beside me  
And your hair is a mess  
And I can't resist you  
It's heaven on earth  
How will I do  
To protect our little world  
Easy life bye bye  
  
It's heaven on earth  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
It's an ordinary day (Come, come, come to me)  
  
Come, come, come to me (ordinary day)  
Come, come, come to me  
Come, come, come to me  
  
Oh when you come to me  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out (oh, when you come to me)  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow

They call to her from across the street  
But they don't know her name  
She's in the wrong place at the wrong time  
Who's to blame  
  
She wonders how to change  
the life she's living  
She wonders if she'll ever get away  
As far as I can see, the writing's on the wall  
  
There's no return, we live, we learn  
The game goes on and on and  
Que sera  
I like you but I don't  
  
Really want to take you home  
Que sera  
It's a lonely life  
Living on my own  
  
Que sera  
What's it gonna be, what's it gonna be  
She left her home when she was seventeen  
Simply disappeared in the rain  
  
Those were bad times so it was high time  
She knows she'd do it again  
She wonders how  
she's gonna make a living  
  
She wonders if she'll make it through the day  
As far as I can see, I've seen it all before  
A lonely girl in a big bad world  
The game goes on and on and  
  
Que sera

Have you heard, have you heard,  
About this girl who was ripped up  
By her roots  
Have you heard, what she learned?  
  
Like humility, you win when you lose  
I have learned, I have learned  
The most horrifying nights have an end  
I was hurt, I was lost.  
  
In the dark I found a way to a friend  
I am standing here in my ravine.  
Once again I see a piece of the sky  
And my joy'll never be denied  
  
'Cause I was meant to be here,  
The only place on earth  
Where you are near, where you are near  
Was a flower, so frail,  
  
And I let the trees grow wild around me.  
Grew so high, hid the sky,  
Shaded everything I needed to see  
Then one night, someone came  
  
Took a knife an ripped me up by my roots  
Tossed astray, far away.  
In my darkest night I started to pray  
I am standing  
  
Why do you, why do you ask  
Why I'm not blaming my god?  
I'll tell you, I'll tell you what,  
He was the only one there  
  
I am standing

You got to believe me  
Remember the words  
Remember the words  
  
When you're down on your knees  
And without a friend  
Standing afraid at the very end  
Back on your own  
Lonely and lost again  
Try to forget what you're going through  
Think of the things that you're gonna do  
Lift up your eyes  
Like they told you to  
Told you to  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Baby say never ever  
We go up  
We go down  
But we never stop  
We're gonna work it until we drop  
Moving along  
You're gonna be on top  
Don't be afraid you are not alone  
Don't ever think you're on your own  
Lift up your eyes  
You'll make it home  
Make it home  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
You got to believe me  
There is a reason  
Why you're crying  
And what ever you may do  
Don't forget to keep on trying  
Do what you got to do  
I said believe in you  
  
(Oh Yeah) Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Just remember the words  
You are never on your own  
You're not alone  
Baby, now and forever  
Remember the words  
You are never all alone, not on your own  
Baby say never ever  
  
Remember the words  
Remember the words

Show me love  
Double up  
Won't you show me love  
  
Show me love  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
I just want to what is mine  
Your love for me wait and see

Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
  
Life will never ever be bad under my spell  
Kiss and tell

Why don't you give me just a smile  
You'd make my day in many ways  
Just a fragment of your lifetime  
'Cause the shine in my eyes will tell  
  
Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living

Won't you show me love  
  
Show me love

Double up  
  
Show me love  
Show me love (oh oh oh)  
Double up (I want to know)

But I can give you something  
No one's gonna give you  
Me, I will fight for you  
So I'll be yours  
Just give me time  
  
Show me love  
I live, I'm learning  
Life will never ever be bad under my spell  
  
Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years

n the road to nowhere, every day was just the same  
So I took my belongings, and hitchhiked no more to blame  
To California, in the warm Summer of love  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
I came to a crossroad, where a stranger gazed and spoke  
He was looking kinda peculiar,  
In a purple colored cloak  
He wore a token, never seen before  
He said: All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
Sunset in Southern California  
and the morning seems so far so far away  
Sunset in Southern California  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
  
I came to his temple at noon the second day  
It was a lot of mumbling, in the shadows did they pray  
Feeling kind of dizzy, a gong struck and people chanted  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then a kind of leader, appeared in fume and smoke  
All dressed in silver,  
An authoritarian bloke  
He turned around and talked to me  
With a demagogic voice  
All my life I been searching  
All my life I been searching  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego  
In the distance there's the light of San Diego

I've got strange ways  
But it won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone  
  
I've got strange ways but  
It won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be back  
  
Again I've got no one  
But it won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone (I'm telling you someday I'll be gone)  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me you've got  
Internet gateways through my world  
God bless you I'm feeling all the  
  
Force you're closing in  
Take it easy  
You dock at my side when  
I'm on fire  
I've got strange ways  
  
Sometimes I lose it (I lose)  
Don't know where I'm going (don't know)  
But I do hope you follow  
All the way  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me  
You've got Internet gateways  
Through my world  
You don't know it  
You're turning all this stone into a heart  
I can see you  
As you're fighting the fire  
When I burn  
I've got (I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone, back)

Summer days (Summer days)  
Lost in another way (uh yeah)  
I was lost in another way (oh yeah)  
  
Who was the man behind the mask  
Exploring your secrets is no easy task  
'Cause it happened long ago (oh yeah)  
You told me the secrets of living large  
And how to behave with my friend in the dark  
Our story lingers on (oh yeah)  
  
How I'm longing for you to give  
Me some magic for us to live  
If you told me it could be done  
I'd believe  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me  
I was lost in another way  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
A teardrop of rain is where you are  
My perfect and gentle star of the stars  
Our story lingers on (oh yeah)  
  
How I'm longing for you to give  
Me some magic for us to live  
If you told me it could be done  
I'd believe  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me  
I was lost in another way  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
I just want to find a way  
'Cause I want to be with you again  
That's the way it ought to be  
Aha aha aha aha  
  
Summer days  
Summer days  
Why did you have to go?  
  
Summer days  
At the sea (Let me know)  
It was just you and me (Have to go)  
I was lost in another way  
Every day (Tell me why did you have to go?)  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me (Every day)  
I was lost in another way (I was lost in another way yeah)  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
Why did you have to go?

The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
  
Why don't we do it, like we used to do it all so long ago?  
They kept together till the bitter end (all the young)  
Today we don't care, even 'bout the youth above the old  
They cannot rise their voice yet  
But later they will do  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
  
No education, we don't need no education telling us  
The right to choose, if we have no choice (no, no, no)  
It's so explosive, any day will burst into a fire  
All come down and guide us  
Before it is too late  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
Whoa who  
  
Always and always and always believe in  
Always believe in  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend

I, I got a new life, you would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad  
How can a person like me care for you?  
I, why do I bother, when you're not the one for me?  
Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo  
Is enough enough?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong?  
  
I, under the pale moon, for so many years I wondered who you are  
How could a person like you bring me joy?  
Under the pale moon, where I see a lot of stars  
Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo  
Is enough enough?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind  
And I am happy now living without you  
I've left you  
Oh, oh-oh-oh  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
  
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-ign) I saw the sign  
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-i-ee-ign)  
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign

Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
You've got the moves to rule the world  
That cute inscru-tability  
Tokyo girl, you're a mystery  
  
Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
Shaking up hearts around the world  
You can't forget that stunning face  
Smiling at you it's your destiny  
  
She's got the face sweet as a baby  
Elegant taste and money to burn  
Her "yes" is "no", "no" is a "maybe"  
Her language is so hard to learn  
  
Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
You've got the moves to rule the world  
That cute inscru-tability  
Tokyo girl, you're a mystery  
  
In Tokyo  
  
Though there's a fire burns inside here  
Outside is ivory, silk and ice  
Nothing she wants is denied her  
You'd better take my advice  
  
Many has tried to get near her  
Deep in the heart of Tokyo  
Found nothing there but a mirror  
She's no one you'll ever know  
  
Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
You've got the moves to rule the world  
That cute inscru-tability  
Tokyo girl, you're a mystery  
  
In Tokyo  
  
She's got the face sweet as a baby  
Elegant taste and money to burn  
Her "yes" is "no", "no" is a "maybe"  
Her language is so hard to learn  
  
Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
You've got the moves to rule the world  
That cute inscru-tability  
Tokyo girl, you're a mystery  
  
Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl  
Shaking up hearts around the world  
You can't forget that stunning face  
Smiling at you it's your destiny  
  
In Tokyo, sweet as a baby  
In Tokyo, sweet as a baby  
In Tokyo, sweet as a baby  
Sweet as a baby  
Sweet as a baby  
Sweet as a baby

Funny how everything changes for me  
Memories take me away  
Each time I open the door to my room  
Where I must stay in all day  
  
I don't want to be here, I'm much too tired  
So I close my eyes and, 'snap', I'm with you  
We are on vacation, you and me together  
Lying in the sunshine  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
One day I'll give you myself in a ring  
Bounded by law and by heart  
(Bounded by law and by heart)  
It's you and me against the world  
That is the way it should be  
(That is the way it should be)  
  
I don't want to be here, I'm much too tired  
So I close my eyes and, 'snap', I'm with you  
We are on vacation you and me together  
Lying in the sunshine  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
Give me my life back  
  
You are the best  
You are the best that has happened to me  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
You are the best that has happened to me  
Please, God, let it be  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
(I travel to Romantis)  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
I travel to Romantis

Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies

All I want to say to you  
Oh yeah!  
  
I was unfeeling  
When you discovered me  
Give me a reason  
To not deny my needs  
I was unwilling  
To give my love away  
But you decided  
To give yours anyway  
  
Oh I can't express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't define  
Unspeakable  
  
Mm, oh yeah  
  
Never thought I needed  
Someone to call my own  
But now that you've got me  
Don't ever let me go  
You leave me unwanting  
Your silence every need  
Nothing is missing  
No love is so complete  
  
Oh I can't express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't define  
Unspeakable  
  
Never had this feeling  
That brings me to my knees  
You helped me to recover  
What's been eluding me  
You're a sensation  
That makes my love run free  
And now I'm speechless  
It's all so clear to me  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable

I knew you before about five years ago  
Then you seemed to be like a person  
Who didn't act like the people I knew  
Yes something was special about you  
A bit insecure but still kind of cute  
At the same time easy to talk to  
And now I see you again  
And you're looking so good  
  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir  
  
I look in the mirror and what do I see  
You're the same kind of person you're like me  
And I can't run away I'm so attracted by you  
  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir  
  
No more hesitation  
You're what I've been searching for  
So stay close to me  
I want to give you a better life  
  
L'amour eternel  
L'amour eternel  
Voulez-vous danser

Kiss me baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin  
Waiting for you - waiting for magic  
Baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin  
Waiting for you - waiting for magic  
  
A man of the world but lost in a dream  
You look at something from a different angle  
But I exist I'm waiting for you  
In a coffin made of glass  
  
Kiss me baby I'm attractive  
Baby get to know me  
Show who you are  
Give me that magic  
Baby I'm eternal  
Lying in a coffin  
Waiting for you  
  
In your dream a girl is dancing close to you (that girl is me)  
Once a witch made her sleep but a prince will wake her up that's you  
  
Kiss me baby  
In the tale is the place to find her  
Reach out to get to know her  
It means so much to me  
The meaning of the book  
  
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up  
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up  
Join the story of the fairytale  
Believe the dream you will not fail  
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up  
  
Kiss me baby  
Waiting for magic it's what I do  
Waiting for magic for me and you  
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up  
  
Caught in a dream how lucky you are  
You can see me I'm the girl behind you  
So open your eyes and turn around  
And watch me dancing join the fairy tales  
  
Kiss me baby  
You cannot reach her on the planet  
That scientist want to call earth  
But if you use your imagination  
You will see her  
You will find her in your dreams  
  
I see no shadows in my dreams  
It is something so romantic  
I can tell it's for real you'll see

You are as reliable as a painting  
In wave wet sand.  
Look in your eyes and I can't see a thing,  
That usually means attraction to me  
  
I've read all the books about love I could find,  
And I've found not one, no,  
Not one word about mine,  
'Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
You're coming and you're going:  
Like the water you never end.  
'Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
And I am just another piece of an island  
In reach for your hands  
feel my doubts when you are in my arms.  
  
Darling: If you know that it's love  
And not charm  
You must tell me so or go elsewhere to hunt.  
'Cause you are  
  
Your love  
I am just another piece of an island  
I can't close my ears when I hear that you call.  
I don't want to fear every tear that could fall  
  
I'll go on my own, and pass people with doubts.  
My goal is to find just a piece of your love.  
Your love is, your love is like the water  
  
You are like the water.  
You are like the water.  
You, you are my shore, and you know  
You are my shore.  
  
'Cause you are reliable like a painting  
I am just another piece of an island

Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
When every race is run and the day is closing in  
I feel the need to hold you  
Let the night begin  
Come softly to me  
Show me why

I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in

They're just keeping us apart  
Come softly to me  
Show me why  
  
Whenever you're near me  
I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
Whenever you're near me  
  
Love is the reason  
We can feel this way inside  
Oh oh  
Turning the world around and making us wild  
Love is the music  
Beating in our hearts tonight  
Oh oh, lighting the way  
To take us deeper inside

Darling you were looking good  
When you came to me  
And asked for a dance  
And I said "we can dance"  
  
Felt like a queen  
Swedish summer nights are hot  
And the trees can talk  
We lay on the grass  
  
So easily, so blessed  
Whispers in blindness  
And I didn't hold you back  
I'm talking about it babe  
  
'Cause you've been teasing me  
I'm talking about it  
'Cause you are bad right through  
Stay with me and I shall want  
  
No other love  
Stay with me another love another lie  
Stay with me and I shall want  
No other love  
  
You were talking so sweet  
But you were touching  
And teasing  
I can hear the soft bells ring  
  
Through a thousand years  
They call out to me  
They say it's only once in a life we love  
Now I've had the honor too  
  
You were holding my hand  
You were kissing my skin  
Stay with me  
Trees are whispering  
Only once my dear

Here I go  
Out to the sea again  
The sunshine fills my hair  
And dreams hang in the air  
Gulls in the sky  
And in my blue eyes  
I know it feels unfair  
There is magic everywhere  
  
Look at me standing here  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
Sun's in your eyes  
The heat is in your hair  
They seem to hate you  
Because you are there  
And I need a friend  
Oh, oh, I need a friend  
To make me happy  
I stand here on my own  
  
Oh oh oh ooh,  
Look at me standing here  
I'm here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
I need a friend  
Oh, I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not so alone  
  
Look at me standing here  
I'm here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

I believe in there's a world down under  
Yeah yeah hey  
I believe in there's a world down under  
  
Wave after wave  
There's no wall for emotions now for me  
Infinity all day long  
Dream after dream  
Had to live in the presence not in the past  
At least a part will last  
  
All I need is love but love's not easy to find  
'Cause I'm saying all the time to all like this  
  
I believe in there's a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey  
  
I know, it's hard  
To be seen as a person when you play  
Alice in Wonderland  
Are kind of figures  
That speak to them  
You don't understand  
What's driven me to that land  
  
All I need is love but love's not easy to find  
All in all I'm saying all the time to all  
  
I believe in there's a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone

We're much too young and life's so big  
We don't know yet what the future brings  
In its hands for us  
What tomorrow brings the future knows  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
We are united  
Young and proud  
  
Young and proud  
We're marching on the same side of destiny  
On the same side of destiny  
Anyway anyway you do it wrong  
  
I'm calling out your name  
But you never hear me  
Anyway anyway you do it wrong  
I'm giving you my love  
  
Though it's never for sale  
Anyway anyway...
