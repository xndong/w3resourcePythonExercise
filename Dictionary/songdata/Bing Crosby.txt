You always stir my imagination  
Sometimes it borders on fantasy  
And sometimes I find visions flash  
Through my mind close to reality  
  
Night a soft guitar a hidden lane  
A moon and here and there a star  
For a man and his dream  
Night a crickets' cry a whispered word  
A kiss and now and then a sigh  
  
For a man and his dream  
And their eyes when they meet  
Seem to say it's sublime  
And their hearts proudly beat  
  
To a tune that is older than time  
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love  
So all the world will say  
There's a man and his dream  
  
And their eyes when they meet  
Seem to say it's sublime  
And their hearts proudly beat  
  
To a tune that is older than time  
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love  
So all the world will say  
There's a man and his dream

You've got to accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
Have faith or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate his last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they do  
Just when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better, accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, do not mess with Mister In-Between  
Do you hear me?  
  
Oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear  
About the elininatin' of the negative  
And the accent on the positive  
And gather 'round me children if you're willin'  
And sit tight while I start reviewin'  
The attitude of doin' right  
  
You've gotta accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom, down to the minimum  
Otherwise pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they say  
Say when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, don't mess with Mister In-Between

After you've gone and left me crying  
After you've gone there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time and I don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
  
After you've gone  
After you've gone  
  
After you've gone and left me crying  
After you've gone there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time and I don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
  
After you've gone  
After you've gone away, so far away  
After you've gone  
After you've gone away

Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band  
Come on and hear, come on and hear 'bout the best band in the land  
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before  
So natural that you want to go to war  
  
That's just the bestest band what am, oh Honey Lamb  
Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, up to the man who's the leader of the band  
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime  
Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band

Caroling, caroling, now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
And the bells rang and the children sang  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
They took some holly, took some mistletoe  
Found a wind free night, sprinkled it with snow  
Found some reindeer's and a reindeer sleigh  
And a shiny start to show the way  
  
They found some tinsel, bright and glittery  
Where the candy came on a tiny tree  
All the happy songs the children sing  
And some jingle bells that ring, ring, ring  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
(And the bells rang)  
They found some stories children love to hear  
(And the children sang)  
Filled with stockings, full of Christmas cheer  
  
Found three wise men all traveling  
Found the wise wise men and a new born king  
  
(And the bells rang)  
And when they finished, trimming every tree each  
(And the children sang)  
The bells begin to ring, oh, so merrily  
(It was Christmas everywhere)  
Tell the world we found a way  
To put together merry Christmas day  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
It was Christmas everywhere

(verse)  
do you make the most of your five senses,  
Or is your life like Old Mother Hubbard's shelf?  
Well, mark this on your slate,  
Life is not an empty plate.  
That's if you appreciate yourself.  
  
(refrain)  
Ev'ry time you're near a rose,  
Aren't you glad you've got a nose?  
And if the dawn is fresh with dew,  
Aren't you glad you're you?  
When a meadowlark appears,  
Aren't you glad you've got two ears?  
And if your heart is singing, too,  
Aren't you glad you're you?  
You can see a summer sky,  
Or touch a friendly hand,  
Or taste an apple pie.  
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?  
And when you wake up each morn,  
Aren't you glad that you were born?  
Think what you've got the whole day through,  
Aren't you glad you're you?

Ev'ry morning mem'ries stray  
Across the sea where flying fishes play  
And as the night is falling  
I find that I'm recalling  
That blissful all enthralling day  
  
Just be-fore I sailed away  
She said the word I longed to hear her say,  
I tenderly caressed her  
Close to my heart I pressed her  
Upon that golden yesterday  
  
I found my love in Avalon  
Beside the bay  
I left my love in Avalon and sailed away  
I dream of her and Avalon  
From dusk 'til dawn  
And so I think I'll travel on  
To Avalon

Night and you and Blue Hawaii  
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me  
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii  
With all this loveliness there should be love  
  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea  
The night is young and so are we, so are we  
  
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you  
  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)  
The night is young and so are we (so are we)  
  
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

Blue skies smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies do I see  
Bluebirds singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds all day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my, how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies from now on  
(Blue skies smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies do I see)  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my, how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies from now on  
Nothing but blue skies from now on

I was talkin' to the whippoorwill  
He says you got a corny trill  
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?  
I was talkin' to the mocking bird  
He says you are the worst he's heard,  
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?  
  
Even the owl-tells me you're foul  
Singin' those lullaby notes,  
Don't be a bring down  
If you can swing down  
Gimme those high notes  
  
There's a lotta talk about you, Bob  
And they're sayin' you're "off the cob"  
Fake it, Mister B  
Take it, follow me, Bob white  
We're gonna break it up tonight

They used to tell me I was building a dream  
And so I followed the mob  
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear  
I was always their right on the job  
  
They used to tell me I was building a dream  
With peace and glory ahead  
Why should I be standing in line  
Just waiting for bread?  
  
Once I built a railroad, I made it run  
Made it race against time  
Once I built a railroad, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once I built a tower up to the sun  
Brick and rivet and lime  
Once I built a tower, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dumb  
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell  
And I was the kid with the drum  
  
Say, don't you remember, they called me "Al"  
It was "Al" all the time  
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal  
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once in khaki suits, ah gee we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dumb  
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell  
And I was the kid with the drum  
  
Oh, say, don't you remember, they called me "Al"  
It was "Al" all the time  
Say, don't you remember, I'm your pal  
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

We were so in love the day love started  
Who would think that we would soon be parted?  
I just can't believe it's true  
I make this appeal to you  
  
Can't we talk it over? Let's talk it over  
Before you tell me you're through  
Can't we sit together and figure whether  
This is the right thing to do  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone  
Missing the thrill of nights that we've known  
Can't we talk it over before it's over  
Before you whisper goodbye forever, let's talk it over, dear  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone  
Missing the thrill of nights that we've known  
Can't we talk it over before it's over  
Before you whisper goodbye forever, let's talk it over, dear

Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
(Come on and) Dance with me  
I want my arm(s) about you  
That (Those) charm(s) about you  
Will carry me through  
  
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

The holly green, the ivy green  
The prettiest picture you've ever seen  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home  
  
It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau  
While cuddling under the mistletoe  
And Santa Claus you know, of course  
Is one of the boys from home  
  
The door is always open  
The neighbors pay a call  
And Father John before he's gone  
Will bless the house and all  
  
How grand it feels to click your heels  
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels  
I'm handing you no blarney  
The likes you've never known  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home

This is Christmas  
This is Christmas  
This is Christmas time

Deck the halls and give a cheer  
For all the things that Christmas is each year  
  
Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true

All the world is tinsel bright  
So glad to know that Christmas is tonight  
  
Ah, Christmas

Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true

Christmas is memories, the kind you always keep  
Deck the halls and give a cheer  
For all the things that Christmas is each year  
  
Oh, Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
When all your wishes come true  
  
Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true

Christmas is sharing  
(Christmas is holly)  
Christmas is caring

How'd ja like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ja like to spend the Holiday away across the sea?  
How'd ja like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ja like to hang your stockin' on a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ja like to stay up late, like the islanders do  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray, for ev'ry day  
Your Christmas dreams come true

We'll be close as pages in a book  
My love and I  
So close, we can share a single look  
Share every sigh  
  
So close that before I hear your laugh  
My laugh breaks through  
And when a tear starts to appear  
My eyes grow misty too  
  
Our dreams won't come tumbling to the ground  
We'll hold them fast  
Darling as the strongest book is bound  
We're bound to last  
  
Your life is my life  
And while life beats away in my heart  
We'll be close as pages in a book  
Never to part  
  
Your life is my life  
And while life beats away in my heart  
We'll be close as pages in a book  
Never to part

When I'm worried and I can't sleep  
I count my blessings instead of sheep  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
When my bankroll is getting small  
I think of when I had none at all  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
  
I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads  
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds  
If you're worried and you can't sleep  
Just count your blessings instead of sheep  
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings  
  
I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads  
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds  
If you're worried and you can't sleep  
Just count your blessings instead of sheep  
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

All day tomorrow  
I'll be whispering your name  
And the day after forever  
I know I'll do the same  
  
May time or winter  
I won't let you out of sight  
And the day after forever  
We'll talk about tonight  
  
Your laughter is a melody  
That I'll remember long  
It plays upon my heartstrings  
It's my favorite song  
  
All through a lifetime  
I'll be loving you and then  
On the day after forever  
I'll just begin again

I love those dear hearts and gentle people  
Who live in my home town  
Because those dear hearts and gentle people  
Will never ever let you down  
  
They read the good book  
From Fri till Monday  
That's how the weekend goes  
I've got a dream house  
I'll build there one day  
With picket fence and rambling rose  
  
I feel so welcome each time I return  
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown  
I love the dear hearts and gentle people  
Who live and love in my home town  
  
There's a place I'd like to go  
And it's back in Idaho  
Where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello  
It's a pleasure and a treat  
To meander down the street  
That's why I want the whole wide world to know  
(I love those dear hearts)  
I love the gentle people  
(Who live in my home town)  
Because those dear hearts and gentle people  
Will never ever let you down  
  
They read the good book  
From Fri till Monday

(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)

It seems like only yesterday  
I sailed from out of Cork  
A wanderer from Erin's isle  
I landed in New York  
There wasn't a soul to greet me there  
A stranger on your shore  
But Irish luck was with me here  
And riches came galore  
And now that I'm going back again  
To dear old Erin's isle  
My friends will meet me on the pier  
And greet me with a smile  
Their faces, sure, I've almost forgot  
I've been so long away  
But me mother will introduce them all  
And this to me will say  
  
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy  
And here is your sister, Kate  
And there's the girl you used to swing  
Down by the garden gate  
Shake hands with all of the neighbours  
And kiss the colleens all  
You're as welcome as the flowers in May  
To dear old Donnegal  
  
They'll give a party when I go home  
They'll come from near and far  
They'll line the roads for miles and miles  
With Irish jauntin' cars  
The spirits'll flow and we'll be gay  
We'll fill your hearts with joy  
The piper'll play an Irish reel  
To greet the Yankee boy  
We'll dance and sing the whole night long  
Such fun as never seen  
The lads'll be decked in corduroy  
The colleens wearin' green  
There'll be thousands there that I never saw  
I've been so long away  
But me mother will introduce them all  
And this to me will say  
  
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy  
And here is your sister, Kate  
And there's the girl you used to swing  
Down by the garden gate  
Shake hands with all of the neighbors  
And kiss the colleens all  
You're as welcome as the flowers in May  
To dear old Donnegal  
  
Meet Branigan, Fannigan, Milligan, Gilligan  
Duffy, McCuffy, Malachy, Mahone  
Rafferty, Lafferty, Donnelly, Connelly  
Dooley, O'Hooley, Muldowney, Malone  
Madigan, Cadigan, Lanihan, Flanihan  
Fagan, O'Hagan, O'Hoolihan, Flynn

Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy  
And here is your sister, Kate  
And there's the girl you used to swing  
Down by the garden gate  
Shake hands with all of the neighbors  
And kiss the colleens all  
You're as welcome as the flowers in May  
To dear old Donnegal

Dinah  
Is there anyone finer  
In the state of Carolina?  
If there is and you know her  
Show her to me.  
Dinah  
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'  
How I love to sit and gazin'  
To the eyes of Dinah Lee.  
Every night why do I  
Shake with fright?  
Cause my Dinah might  
Change her mind about me.  
Oh, Dinah  
Should you wander to China  
I would hop an ocean liner  
Just to be with Dinah Lee.  
  
Mills bros repeat verse.  
Bing scats.  
  
Every night why do I  
Shake with fright?  
Cause my Dinah might  
Change her mind about me.  
  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Said it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Snag it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
Ah, Tell it.  
The name of this song is Dinah.  
  
Dinah  
Wander to China,  
The state of Carolina  
Listen, and you know her  
I would like to have you show her to me.  
Dinah  
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'  
How I love to sit and gazin'  
To the eyes of Dinah Lee.  
  
Oh, Dinah  
Should you wander to China  
I would get me an ocean liner  
Just to be with Dinah Lee.

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze  
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze  
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
Ba boo ba ba boo  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
No  
Poppa, don't you fence me in

In a sparkling moment,  
I loved you, you loved me.  
Oh, how sweet fate can he.  
In that happy moment  
I forgot all my past.  
Now I realize the way  
The spell was cast,  
At last,  
Refrain  
Once we walked alone  
Down by the river ,  
All the world our own  
Down by the river.  
Maybe the river made our love song start.  
Full was the river, yet more full my heart.  
So I love you two,  
You and the river ,  
I'll he there for you,  
I and the river  
You will remember when you hear my song  
Down when the river rolls along

There's a famous thoroughfare  
I've heard collegiates say  
I'm not referring to Piccadilly  
It's not 42nd Street  
  
It's not the rue de la Paix  
Nor is it Market Street in Philly  
Ask most any college Romeo  
To complete your education you must go....  
  
Down the old ox road  
Though you'll never find where it is  
By looking in maps  
With a little investigation you'll discover perhaps  
  
That this old tradition's not a place  
But just a proposition called  
The old ox road  
The old ox road  
  
Ox road could be any romantic spot  
A country highway or a moonlit yacht  
It could be in the parlor  
When the lights are burning low  
  
It could be in the movie  
In the very last row  
  
Down the old ox road  
In the magic of the moonlight  
You are filled with delight  
While the leaves that flutter o'er you  
  
Whisper lover tonight  
Why keep waiting, and debating  
When you know it's time for mating  
  
On the old ox road  
On the old ox road

Ohhh  
Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you  
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say night-ie night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear  
Still cravin' your ki-iss  
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear  
Just sayin' this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Yeah-eah Bob, you ain't just dreamin'  
You is awake  
Mm  
  
Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear  
Still cravin' your ki-iss  
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear  
All I keep sayin' is this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little drea-eam of me  
  
Drea-eam a little drea-eam of me

There's something strange in the old corral  
There's a breeze, though the wind has died  
Though I'm alone in the old corral  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do you ride tonight?  
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago  
Are you on the trail of buffalo?  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do you ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo  
Are you headin' for the Alamo?  
  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do you talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do you walk tonight?  
  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
My tears will be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,  
There's no song, still I hear guitars,  
There is no dust, still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars

Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Cheeks like the roses,  
Teeth like the pearl,  
Eyes with the heaven's blue)  
  
You made me love you  
I'm in a whirl,  
  
(You wonderful, marvelous, beautiful girl)  
  
Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Children love you they seem to know)  
  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(The whole world says "hello")  
  
"Hello"  
  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Everywhere you go)

Far away places with strange-sounding names  
Far away over the sea  
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names  
Are callin', callin' me  
  
Goin' to China or maybe Siam  
I want to see for myself  
Those far away places I've been readin' about  
In a book that I took from the shelf  
  
I start getting restless whenever I hear  
The whistle of a train  
I pray for the day I can get underway  
And look for those castles in Spain  
  
They call me a dreamer, well, maybe I am  
But I know that I'm burnin' to see  
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names  
Callin', callin' me

Gettin' to know you,  
Gettin' to know all about you.  
Gettin' to like you,  
Gettin' to hope you like me.  
  
Gettin' to know you,  
Putting it my way but nicely.  
You are precisely,  
My cup of tea.  
  
Gettin' to know you,  
Gettin' to feel free and easy.  
When I am with you,  
Gettin' to to know what to say.  
Haven't you noticed,  
Suddenly I 'm bright and breezy,  
Because of all the beautiful and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day by day.  
  
Gettin' to know you,  
Gettin' to know all about you.  
When I am with you,  
Gettin' to to know what to say.  
Haven't you noticed,  
Suddenly I 'm bright and breezy,  
Because of all the beautiful and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day by day.

I need your love so badly  
I love you, oh, so madly  
But I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you!  
I thought at last I'd found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender  
Just for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover  
that I'm the lover, meant for you  
And I'd be true  
But what's the good of scheming  
I Know I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand a  
Ghost of a chance with you!

Gigi, am I a fool without a mind  
Or have I merely been to blind to realize?  
Oh Gigi, why you've been growin' up  
Before my very eyes!  
  
Gigi, you're not at all the funny  
Awkward little girl I knew  
Oh no, overnight there's been a breathless  
Change in you!  
  
Gigi, why you were tremblin' on the brink  
Was I out yonder somewhere blinkin' at a star?  
Oh Gigi, have I been standin' up to close  
Or back too far?  
  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire?  
Oh, what miracle  
Has made you the way you are?  
  
Oh Gigi, have I been standin' up to close  
Or back too far?  
  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire?  
Oh, what miracle  
Has made you the way you are?

Go fly a kite and tie your troubles to the tail  
They'll be blown away by a merry gale,  
Go fly a kite and toss your worries to the wind  
And they won't come back, they'll be too chagrined.  
Go on make friends with the sky  
Have a talk with the sun  
It's the bright way to live, if you'll pardon the pun  
Go fly a kite and you'll imagine you're a king  
Cause you've got your world on a piece of string

Goodnight sweetheart, all my prayers are for you  
Goodnight sweetheart, I'll be watching o'er you  
Tears and parting may make us forlorn  
But with the dawn a new day is born  
So I'll say goodnight sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow  
Goodnight Sweetheart, when we meet tomorrow  
Dreams enfold you, in them, dear, I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart goodnight.

Happy Holiday  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
While the merry bells keep ringing  
May your ev'ry wish come true  
  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
May the calendar keep bringing  
Happy holidays to you  
  
Come To Holiday Inn  
If you're burdened down with trouble  
If your nerves are wearing thin  
Park your load down the road  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If the traffic noise affects you  
Like a squeaky violin  
Kick your cares down the stairs  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If you can't find someone who  
Would set your heart a-whirl  
Take your car and motor to  
The home of boy meets girl  
  
If you're laid-up with a breakdown  
Throw away your vitamin  
Don't get worse, grab your nurse  
And come to Holiday Inn  

I saw the harbor lights  
They only told me we were parting  
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me  
I watched the harbor lights  
How could I help if tears were starting  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silv'ry sea  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
  
Have I told you lately that I miss you  
When the stars are shinin' in the sky  
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleepin'  
Every dream I dream is you somehow  
Have I told you who I'd like to share my love forever  
Well darlin' I'm telling you now  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.

It happened  
I felt it happened  
I was awake  
I wasn't blind  
I didn't think  
I felt it happened  
Now I believe in matter over mind.  
  
And now you see we mustn't wait  
The nearest moment that we marry is too late!  
  
Have you met Miss Jones  
Someone said as we shook hands  
She was just Miss Jones to me  
  
Then I said Miss Jones  
You're a girl who understand  
I'm a boy who must be free.  
  
And all at once I lost my breath  
And all at once was scared to death  
And all at once I hold the earth and sky!  
  
Now I met Miss Jones  
And well keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I

An American landed on Erin's green isle  
He gazed at Killarney with rapturous smile  
"How can I buy it?" he said to his guide  
"I'll tell you how" with a smile he replied.  
  
How can you buy all the stars in the skies?  
How can you buy two blue Irish eyes?  
How can you purchase a fond mother's sighs?  
How can you buy Killarney?  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald, the shamrock, the Blarney.  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney.  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald, the shamrock, the Blarney.  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney.

How lovely is Christmas  
With boughs in the hall  
When bells ringle jingle  
And friends come to call  
  
How lovely is Christmas  
With joy on the wing  
While under your window  
The carolers sing  
  
God rest ye, be merry  
Give peace while you may  
Remember the child  
Who was born on this day  
  
How lovely is Christmas  
With songs in the air  
A bright merry Christmas  
Dear friends everywhere

There's been a sayin' goin' round  
And I begin to think it's true  
It's awful hard to love someone  
When they don't care about you  
  
Once I had a lovin' gal  
The sweetest little thing in town  
But now she's gone and left me  
She done turn me down  
  
Now I ain't got nobody, and nobody cares for me!  
That's why I'm sad and lonely,  
Won't somebody come and take a chance with me?  
  
I'll sing you love songs, honey, all the time,  
If you'll only say you'll be sweet gal of mine,  
Oh, I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me!  
  
I'll sing you love songs, honey, all the time,  
If you'll only say you'll be sweet gal of mine,  
Oh, I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me!

I can't begin to tell you  
How much you mean to me  
My world would end  
If ever we were through  
  
I can't begin to tell you  
How happy I would be  
If I could speak my mind  
Like others do  
  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever we're apart  
But when you're near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart  
  
So take the sweetest phrases  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
I've said them all to you  
  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever we're apart  
But when you're near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart  
  
So take the sweetest phrases  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
I've said them all to you

I'm free as a wondering breeze  
I'm free to wander any place I please and yet  
I can't escape from you  
I'm free as the birds in the trees  
I'm even free to sail the seven seas and yet  
I can't escape from you  
I could ride away and hide away,  
Where we were miles apart  
But when I got there I'd find you there  
Right in my heart  
And so you see that I'm really not free  
I'm so afraid you might escape from me  
And yet I can't escape from you

Why did you let me love you?  
Why did you let me fall?  
Why should it be when it's plain to see  
That you can't see me at all?  
  
I need your love so badly  
I love you, oh, so madly  
But I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
I thought at last I'd found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender just for a tender  
Kiss or two  
You might discover that I'm the lover  
Meant for you, I'd be true  
  
But what's the good of scheming  
I know, I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
And I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender just for a tender  
Kiss or two  
You might discover that I'm the lover  
Meant for you, I'd be true  
  
But what's the good of scheming  
I know, I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you

It was a lovely April shower,  
It was a most convenient door,  
I found a million dollar baby  
In a five and ten cent store.  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hung around for three or four  
Around the million dollar baby  
In the five and ten cent store.  
  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes,  
I kept buying china  
Until the crowd got wise.  
  
Incidentally,  
If you should run into a shower,  
Well step inside my cottage door,  
And meet the million dollar baby  
From the five and ten cent store  
  
Love comes along like a popular song  
Anytime or anywhere at all,  
Rain or sunshine,  
Spring or fall.  
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello  
In a very unexpected place,  
For example, take my case.  
  
[Repeat]

I love you  
Hums the April breeze.  
I love you  
Echo the hills.  
I love you  
The golden dawn agrees  
As once more she sees  
Daffodils.  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melody.  
I love you,  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me.  
  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melody.  
I love you,  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me.

I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas Day  
On Christmas Day  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
In the morning  
And all the bells  
On Earth  
Shall ring  
On Christmas Day  
  
In the morning  
Let us all  
Rejoice again  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas day  
Let us all  
Rejoice again  
On Christmas Day  
In the morning  
  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas Day  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
In the morning

Some children see Him lily white  
The baby Jesus born this night  
Some children see Him lily white  
With dresses of their faith  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all little children who have no Christmas tree  
I sing Noel, Noel, Noel  
For little girls who have no pretty dress to wear  
Little boys who have no teddy bears  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all lonely children who cry on Christmas Eve  
I sing Noel, Noel, Noel  
For little girls whose hands are trembling in the cold  
Little boys whose eyes are too slow  
May the new born Savior  
Turn His tender face to you  
May He help us all  
To make this world a better place for you  
I sing Noel, I sing Noel for children  
For all little children who have no Christmas tree  
Let's all sing Noel, rings the bells of Christmas  
For all lonely children wherever they may be  
Noel, Noel, come spend Christmas with me  
Noel, Noel, come spend Christmas with me  
I sing Noel  
I sing Noel  
I sing Noel  

I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande  
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan  
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer cause I don't know how  
Sure ain't a fixing to start in now  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande  
And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand  
I'm a riding fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the Lone Star State  
Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande  
And we come to town just to hear the band  
We know all the songs that the cowboys know  
'Bout the big corral where the doggies go  
We learned them all on the radio  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm an old cowhand  
Oh yes, Mr. Bing.  
Too hot for you, Uncle Fudd?  
Down from the Rio Grande  
Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
and the Injuns run up a rug or two  
and the old Bar X is just a barbecue, yeah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm a pioneer who began from scratch  
I don't bat an eye in a shootin' match.  
They don't call me Elmer, they call me Satch.  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Get along little horsy  
Get along little horsy  
Yippie yi yo kayah, oh!

I have given you my true love,  
But you love a new love.  
What am I supposed to do now  
With you now, you're through?  
You'll be on your merry way  
And there's only this to say:  
I'm through with love  
I'll never fall again.  
Said adieu to love  
Don't ever call again.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
I've locked my heart  
I'll keep my feelings there.  
I have stocked my heart  
With icy, frigid air.  
And I mean to care for no one  
Because I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you  
To hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me for you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.

Feat. The Buddy Cole Trio  
  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
Twas on a night like this  
  
I whispered, be true to me  
And she sighed, si, si  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Save your pappy a chair  
  
When the party's getting a glow on  
And singin' fills the air  
In the shank of the night  
When the doin's are right  
  
Well you can tell em I'll be there  
I like a barbecue  
I like to boil a ham  
And I vote for bola baste stew  
  
What's that?  
I like a weenie bake, steak and a layer cake  
And you'll get a tummy ache too  
We'll rent a tent or a teepee  
  
Let the town crier cry  
"All's well!"  
And if it's RSVP  
This is what I'll reply  
  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em we'll be there  
If you need a pair of freeloaders  
To fracture your affair  
  
I may even give them Pagliacci  
Now stand back and give him air  
If one can relax and we'll have a few yaks  
And you can tell them we'll be there  
  
"Oui," said the bumblebee  
"Let's have jubilee."  
"When?" said the prairie hen, "Soon?"  
"Sure," said the dinosaur  
  
"Where?" said the grisly bear  
"Under the light of the moon."  
"How about your brother, jackass?"  
Everyone gaily cried  
  
"Are you coming to the fracas?"  
Ain't gonna blow it  
"And all the respects," he sighed  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Stick 'em on my hair  
If perchance we look a bit peeked  
  
Remember se la guerre  
If we're still on our feet  
And there's something to eat  
Well you can tell them we'll be there  
  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening  
Better save a chair  
  
When the party's getting a glow on  
And singin' fills the air  
If there's gas in my hack  
And my laundry is back  
  
If there's room for one more  
And you need me  
Why sure  
If you need a new face or a tenor or base  
  
If I can climb out of bed and put a head on my head  
Well you can tell 'em we'll be there.

't Was on the Isle of Capri that I found her  
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree  
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her  
Where we met on the Isle of Capri  
  
She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning  
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me  
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning  
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said "Lady, I'm a rover,  
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"  
  
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger  
't Was goodbye at the Villa Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said "Lady, I'm a rover,  
Can you spare a fine word of love?"  
  
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger  
't Was goodbye on the Isle of Capri (3x)

It came upon the midnight clear  
That glorious song of old  
From Angels playing near the earth  
To touch their harps of gold  
  
Peace on the earth could will two men  
From Heaven's all-gracious King  
The world in solemn stillness lay  
To hear the Angels sing  
  
And I hear them singing  
Sing, I do hear them singing  
  
The first Noel the Angel did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
Haven't felt like this, my dear  
Since I can't remember when.  
It's been a long, long time  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I've dreamed about you.  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.  
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
  
Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long time.  
Haven't felt like this my dear  
Since I can't remember when  
It's been a long, long time.  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I dreamed about you.  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.  
So kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
Long, long time.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
Take a look in the five and ten  
Glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight to see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And mom and dad can hardly wait  
For school to start again  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel  
One in the park as well  
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring  
Is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight to see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
Sure it's Christmas once more

Your sweet expression  
The smile you gave me  
The way you looked when we met  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
I hear you whisper  
"I'll always love you"  
I know it's over, and yet  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
So I must dream  
To have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream  
Than have that lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
  
Each little moment  
Is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget

Was in a Paris cafe that first I found him  
He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war  
But war was over  
And here's how peace had crowned him  
A few cheap medals to wear and nothing more  
Now every night in the same cafe he shows up  
And as he strolls by ladies hear him say  
If you admire me, hire me  
A gigolo who knew a better day  
  
Just a gigolo, everywhere I go  
People know the part I'm playing  
Paid for every dance  
Selling each romance  
Every night some heart betraying  
There will come a day  
Youth will pass away  
Then what will they say about me  
When the end comes I know  
They'll say just a gigolo  
As life goes on without me  
  
Just a gigolo, everywhere I go  
People know the part I'm playing  
Paid for every dance  
Selling each romance

Youth will pass away  
Then what will they say about me  
When the end comes I know  
They'll say just a gigolo  
As life goes on without me

Just one more chance  
To prove it's you alone I care for  
Each night I say a little prayer for  
Just one more chance  
  
Just one more night  
To taste the kisses that enchant me  
I'd want no others if you'd grant me  
Just one more chance  
  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still, I'm hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance  
  
We spend our lives in groping for happiness  
I found it once and tossed it aside  
I paid for it with hours of loneliness  
I've nothing to hide  
I'd bury my pride for...  
(mmm-bo-ba-ba-boo)  
Just one more chance  
(mmm-bo-ba-ba-boo)  
Just one more chance  
  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still, I'm hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day

sway

The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night

The moon was yellow and the night was young  
A smile brought us together, a  
And I was wond'ring whether  
We'd meet again some day  
  
The moon was yellow and a song was sung  
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination  
To give my heart away!  
  
Her we are is our romance to continue?  
Will it be my luck to win you?  
May I look that far?  
  
Ah! My love is mellow and my hopes are strung  
Around that cupid fellow  
Behold! The moon is yellow  
And the night is young

Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair  
You certainly know the right thing to wear  
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight  
And I could get so romantic tonight  
  
You're all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now don't tell me I'm wrong  
And what a night to go dreaming  
Mind if I tag along  
  
If I say I love you  
I want you to know  
It's not just because there's moonlight  
Although, moonlight becomes you so  
  
You're all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now don't tell me I'm wrong

It's not just because there's moonlight  
Although, moonlight becomes you so

On the first of May, it is moving day,  
Spring is here, so blow your job,  
Throw your job away!  
Now's the time to trust,  
To your wanderlust,  
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait  
Just you wait!  
  
In a mountain greenery,  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together.  
While you love your lover,  
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,  
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.  
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,  
So you can cook... while I stand looking  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery home!  
  
Simple cooking means  
More than French Cuisines  
I've a banquet planned which is  
Sandwiches and beans  
Coffee's just as grand  
With a little sand  
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy  
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! 'Atta boy.  
  
In a mountain greenery,  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together.  
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering  
Where no pests are pestering  
No dear momma holds us in tether  
Mosquitoes here,  
Won't bite you dear,  
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery,  
Far from life's machinery  
Bless our mountain greenery home!

I feel so happy, I wanna shout  
Well, tell me Bing  
Tell me what it?s all about?  
I found my one idea  
And this time I'm sure it?s real  
  
Yip yip de hootie  
Got me a beauty  
She sure is a dream  
My baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
She didn't say no  
  
Cock cock-a-doodle  
You're off your noodle  
You're way off the beam  
'Cause baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
She couldn't say go  
  
Knock me a daisy  
Now what would I do  
With a daisy, all day?  
You wear it and bear it  
There, you sound kinda crazy  
I'm happy that way  
  
Hi diddle diddle  
March down the middle  
And now we're a team  
'Cause baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
Yes, she couldn't say no

She said yes, she said yes

Life is a book that we study  
Some of its leaves bring a sigh  
There it was written by a buddy  
That we must part, you and I  
  
Nights are long since you went away  
I think about you all through the day  
My buddy, my buddy  
Nobody quite so true  
  
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand  
Just long to know that you understand  
My buddy, my buddy  
Your buddy misses you  
  
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand  
Just long to know that you understand  
My buddy, my buddy  
Your buddy misses you  
  
Your buddy misses you, yes I do

Oh, you can kiss her on a Monday  
A Monday, a Monday, very, very good  
Or you can kiss her on a Tuesday  
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, she rather hopes you would  
  
Or you can kiss her on a Wednesday, a Thursday  
A Friday, a Saturday is best  
But never, never on a Sunday, a Sunday, a Sunday  
'Cause that's her day of rest  
  
Come any day and you be her guest  
Any day you say but her day of rest  
Just name the day that you like the best  
Only stay away on her day of rest  
  
Oh, you can kiss her on a cool day, a hot day, a wet day  
Which ever one you choose  
Or try to kiss her on a gray day, a May day, a pay day  
She'll never will refuse  
  
And if you make it on a bleak day, a freak day, a week day  
While you can be her guest  
But never, never on a Sunday, a Sunday  
A one day she needs a little rest  
  
Just name the day that you like the best  
Only stay away on her day of rest  
  
Oh, you can kiss her on a cool day, a hot day, a wet day  
Which ever one you choose

And if you make it on a bleak day, a freak day, a week day  
While you can be her guest  
But never, never on a Sunday, a Sunday  
The one day she's got to get her rest

Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts get the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes, woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-woo  
Hey Jim, you better get out the rig, woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-woo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause lots of them been travellin' for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadelphia  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
  
If I never have a cent  
I'll be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street

Do I want to be with you  
As the years come and go?  
Only forever  
If you care to know.  
Would I grant all your wishes  
And be proud of the task  
Only forever  
If someone should ask.  
How long would it take me  
To be near if you beckon?  
Off hand I would figure  
Less than a second.  
Do you think I'll remember  
How you looked when you smile?  
Only forever  
That's puttin' it mild.

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true  
  
Someday, I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, why can't I?  
If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh, why can't I?

Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven  
Don'tcha know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?  
(You'll find your fortune fallin' all over town)  
(Be sure that your umbrella)  
Is upside down  
  
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers  
If you want the things you love, you must have showers  
(So when you hear it thunder) Don't run under a tree  
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me  
  
(Every time it rains, it rains) Pennies from heaven

Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
And your eyes mustn't glow like mine  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove  
  
Well, sweetheart, they're suspecting things  
People will say we're in love

When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor  
Said all the gentlemen "Obviously,"  
"The madam has the cutest personality"  
  
And think of all the books about do Barry's looks  
What was it made her the toast of Paree?  
She had a well-developed personality  
  
What did Romeo see in Juliet?  
Or Figaro in Figarette?  
Or Jupiter in Juno?  
You know!  
  
And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced  
No doubt it must have been easy to see  
That she knew how to use her personality  
  
A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well  
And never sit on the boss's left knee  
Unless she's got a perfect personality  
  
A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair  
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee  
If she can show a faultless personality  
  
Why are certain girls offered certain things  
Like sable coats and wedding rings?  
By men who wear their spats right?  
(That's right!)  
  
So don'tcha say "I'm smart and have the kindest heart"  
Or "what a wonderful sister I'd be"  
Just tell me how you like my  
"Rufff!  
(Personality)  
  
Baby, you've got the cutest  
Personality!!

Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, drinking beer in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night she caught me right  
And now I'm on the run  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, I'll sing you every night Bing  
And I'll woo you every day  
I'll be your regular mama  
And I'll put that gun away  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody  
  
oh, she kicked out my windshield  
And she hit me over the head  
She cussed and cried and said I lied  
And she wished that I was dead  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
We're three tough gals  
From deep down Texas way  
We got no pals  
They don't like the way we play  
We're a rough rooting tooting shooting trio  
But you ought to see my sister Cleo  
She's a terror make no error  
But there ain't no nicer terror  
Here's what we tell her  
  
Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Pappy made a batch of corn  
The revenuers came  
The drought was slow  
So now they know  
You can't do that to Mame  
  
Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, singing songs in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night it didn't seem right  
And now I'm on the run  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down

Oh, please.  
Lend your little ear to my pleas  
Lend a ray of cheer to my pleas  
Tell me that you love me too.  
Please  
Let me hold you tight in my arms  
I could find delight in your charms  
Every night my whole life through.  
Your eyes reveal that you have the soul of  
An angel white as snow.  
How long must I play the role of  
A gloomy Romeo?  
Oh, please.  
Say you're not intending to please  
Speed that happy ending and please  
Tell me that you love me too.  
  
(Bing whistles and da da dees)  
  
Your eyes reveal that you have the soul of  
An angel white as snow.  
How long must I play the role of  
A gloomy Romeo?  
Oh, please  
Say you're not intending to tease  
Speed that happy ending and please,  
Tell me that you love me too.

I don't care where I'm going  
Just as long as I'm with you  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
I'll be just like your horses  
And I'll stick to you like glue  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
I'm glad you're fooling Pepsodent (oh, that happy snow)  
Stealing all that cash  
I hear your show on Thursdays (nice, huh?)  
What a lot of eggs you smash  
  
Well at least I don't depend upon  
Cologne's big moustache (oh, he gave me the brush)  
You're faithful and you're fair  
Put it there (skin me Dad, skin me)  
  
You've got that something in your voice  
So right for selling cheese (hustle a lot of the stuff)  
Put it there, pal. Put it there (put that back in the bowl)  
  
You know, I think your jokes are great (really?)  
It's just that folks are hard to please (they're just snobs, that all)  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
Your face could make a fortune  
Just your nose should make a lot (how do you siphon?)  
I like the way you wear those gaudy-colored shirts you've got, boy  
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot  
You're such a perfect square (oh-oh, is that on the paper?)  
(Where? Where?)  
  
Shall we dance  
Sorry, I have my heavy underwear on  
Oh, just to once around, to the adrenalin, huh  
Well, OK, if I lead  
  
My colleague, my crony, my cohort, my friend  
Companions, confederates, chums to the end  
Like meat and potatoes, or salt and tomatoes  
Boy, what a blend  
  
Don't put it in the paper (don't worry about me)  
Don't put it on the air (I'll finish it)  
Don't put it in your pipe  
Put it there  
  
Confidentially, do you like this as well as singing  
Leave your name with the girl when you go out  
We may get to you for some crowd noises  
Be sure and call me  
All right

Do you remember one September afternoon  
I stood with you and listened to a wedding tune,  
And didn't I go with you on your honeymoon?  
Remember me?  
  
Do you recall a cottage small upon a hill  
Where ev'ry day I had to pay another bill?  
And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still  
Remember me?  
  
I can see that little angel on your knee  
Can't you see, He kinda sorta looks like me  
For I'm the boy whose only joy is loving you  
Who worries till he hurries home when day is through  
And I'm the guy you give you goodnight kisses to  
Remember me?

Here's a happy tune you'll love to croon  
They call it Sam's song  
It's catchy as can be, the melody  
They call it Sam's song  
Nothing on your mind  
And then you'll find you're humming Sam's Song  
Why, it makes you grin  
Gets under your skin as only a song can do  
  
People that you meet out on the street  
All whistling Sam's Song  
Everyone you see will soon agree that it's a grand song  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
You'll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon this happy tune  
They call it Sam's song  
  
"And now another treatment of this  
Classic American Theme  
Brought to you by, Mr. Gary Crosby"  
  
Here's a happy tune  
(That'll bring you a smile all the while)  
(When you croon it you're really in style)  
And the title is Sam's Song  
It's catchy as can be  
(With a sly little beat)  
(And the melody sweet keeps you tapping your feet)  
And the title is Sam's Song  
  
Nothing on your mind  
(But the news of the day)  
(And the bills you must pay keep your hair turning gray)  
(But you're still humming Sam's Song)  
"Are you alright"  
"How's your brace"  
(Why, it makes you grin)  
(Gets under your skin as only a song can do)  
  
People that you meet  
(Hello Joe, what you know)  
(And remind me to Moe, tell him business is slow)  
(But I'm whistling)  
Sam's Song  
Everyone you see  
(Has a story to tell or a gimmick to sell)  
(But agree that it's swell)  
(And it's really)  
A grand song  
  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
You'll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon  
Like a lark in the park  
Who is making his mark serenading the dark  
With a chorus of Sam's song  
  
If you learn to croon the happy tune  
They call it Sam's song

You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why, why?  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice  
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice

So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Little tin horns, little toy drums  
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo  
Elephants, boats and kiddy cars too  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
The kids and girls in boy land  
Will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a toy land town  
All around the Christmas tree  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

You mean the big fat man  
With the long white beard  
He's coming to town

In the shadows, let me come and sing to you  
Let me dream a song that I can bring to you  
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you  
Let me linger long  
Let me live my song  
  
In the winter, let me bring the spring to you  
Let me feel that I mean everything to you  
Love's old song will be new  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you  
  
Shadows on the wall  
I can see them fall  
Here and there  
Everywhere  
Silhouettes in blue  
Dancing in the dew  
Here am I  
Where are you?  
  
In the winter, let me bring the spring to you  
Let me feel that I mean everything to you  
Love's old song will be new  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you, dear  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you

The singing hills (mmmmm)  
Are singing tonight (mmmmm)  
  
And echoing a song of long ago  
The singing hills (mmmmm)  
  
Were singing that night (mmmmm)  
That lovely night you said, "I love you so"  
The wind in the valley joined in our sweet refrain  
But now the wind and I  
Each night we cry "Come back again."  
  
Though you are gone (mmmmm)  
The song lingers on (mmmmm)  
  
Still echoing among the singing hills

Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue,  
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue  
I'd swap my horse and dog for you, oh  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue  
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.  
  
I drove a herd of cattle out  
From old Nebraska way  
That's how I come to be in the state of I-o-way.  
I met a gal and asked her how  
She said "Indeed I do"  
I asked her what her name was and she said  
"Sioux City Sue"  
  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue,  
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue  
I'd swap my horse and dog for you, oh  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue  
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go  
Let's look at the snow  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
(We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land)  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
(There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray)  
(It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day)  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts  
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Whoo, whoo there now  
Steady, easy, whoo, everybody out

Snow  
It won't be long before we'll all be there with snow  
Snow  
I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow  
  
Snow  
I long to clear a path and lift a spade of snow  
Snow  
Oh, to see a great big man entirely made of snow  
  
Where it's snowing  
All winter through  
That's where I want to be  
Snowball throwing  
That's what I'll do  
How I'm longing to ski  
Through the snow-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Those glist'ning houses that seem to be built of snow  
Snow  
Oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow  
  
What is Christmas with no snow  
No white Christmas with no snow  
Snow  
  
I'll soon be there with snow  
I'll wash my hair with snow  
And with a spade of snow  
I'll build a man that's made of snow  
I'd love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye  
Go to sleep  
And dream  
Of snow  

Soon, the lonely nights will be ended,  
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended.  
I've found the happiness I've waited for,  
The only girl that I was fated for.  
  
Oh! Soon, a little cottage will find us  
Safe with all our cares far behind us.  
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,  
Let's make that day come soon.  
  
Soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely,  
Soon, you'll find I live for you only.  
When I'm with you who cares what time it is  
Or what the place or the climate is?  
  
Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing  
Home through every storm, never failing,  
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,  
Let's make that day come soon.

And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadow of my heart.  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by.  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights  
Dreaming of a song.  
The melody haunts my reverie.  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new.  
And each kiss, an inspiration.  
  
But that was long ago.  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song.  
  
Beside a garden wall where stars are bright  
You are in my arms.  
A nightingale sings its fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses bloom.  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
That stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain.

Fore!  
  
Straight down the middle  
It went straight down the middle  
Then it started to hook just a wee, wee bit  
That's when my caddie lost sight of it  
That little white pellet has never been found to this day  
But it went straight down the middle like they say  
  
Whack down the fairway  
It went smack down the fairway  
Then it started to slice just a smidge off line  
It headed for two then it bounced off nine  
My caddie says long as you're still in the state you're okay  
Yes it went straight down the middle quite a ways  
  
The sun was never brighter  
The greens were never greener  
And I was never keener to play  
I heard it came down the middle  
It went zing down the middle  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
There's always the lies in the locker room  
And I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle today  
  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
Though they should charge just for listening in the locker room  
But I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle  
Where it wound up is a riddle  
But it went straight down the middle far away

A lot of cobwebs in your head,  
You're getting rusty, so you say,  
You feeling bad, and everything looks gray, and say,  
You're getting worried, yes indeed,  
I know exactly what you need:  
A little sunshine will make you feel okay!  
Now lookie here:  
Give the blues a chase,  
Find a sunny place,  
Go and change your face  
With sunshine!  
With sunshine!  
Pay your doctor bills,  
Throw away his pills,  
You can cure your ills  
With sunshine!  
Why don't you take your tear drops one by one,  
Before it gets too late,  
Hang them up out in the sun,  
And they'll evaporate!  
When the trouble starts  
Pounding at your heart,  
Trouble will depart  
With sunshine

When you see land  
(Out of the window of a train)  
Kinda green and grassy,  
(How in the world can you complain?)  
Beneath a moon  
(You ought to see the way it shines)  
Bright beyond compare,  
(The way it shines upon the pines)  
When you hear blue jays chirping high and sassy,  
And catch one sniff of southern cooking  
Hanging on the evening air  
(Supper's waiting on the table)  
When you see folks  
(Having their after dinner chats)  
All polite and classy  
(Gentlemen all remove their hats)  
And every smile  
(Perfect harmony and peace)  
Bids you stay and rest,  
(Hand the porter your valise)  
Get off that train,  
(Sit down and rest your chassis,)  
You're in Tallahassee  
(The Cap8ital City of Florida and)  
The Southland at its best!  
(But Dixie at its very best!)

When two guys pull together its teamwork  
In foul or sunny weather it's teamwork  
What does it take to make any business climb  
You'll find it takes teamwork every time  
  
Incidentally, your jokes will kill the yokels its teamwork  
I love your hokey vocals its teamwork  
Like Fred Astaire and Ginger yet twice as chic  
We'll give them that teamwork, cheek to cheek  
  
Here we are, just like in Zanzibar  
Still nothing, still a star  
That's quite a stab from old flab  
They always pay us plenty for teamwork  
We split it 80-20 that's teamwork  
(Yours is tax free)  
When others start to part and go off the beam  
Like Siamese brothers we'll be on each other's team  
  
No fuss about the billing it's teamwork  
The smallest type is thrilling its teamwork  
Although we hold each other in low esteem  
We're loaded with teamwork  
Hey now  
What's life without teamwork  
Go boy  
Unless you got teamwork there's no team

You came, I was alone  
I should have known you were temptation  
You smiled, luring me on  
My heart was gone, you were temptation  
It would be thrilling  
If you were willing  
If it can never be  
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours  
  
Here is my heart, take it and say  
We'll never part  
I'm just a slave  
Only a slave to you, temptation  
You were born to be kissed  
I can't resist.  
  
You are temptation and I am yours  
Here is my heart, take it and say  
We'll never part  
I'm just a slave  
Only a slave to you, temptation

The Bells of St. Mary's  
Ah, hear they are calling  
The young loves, the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out, ring out  
For you and me  
  
The Bells of St. Mary's  
Ah, hear they are calling  
The young loves, the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out, ring out  
For you and me

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Noel, Noel  
  
The first Noel  
The angel did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
  
In fields where they  
Lay a keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the east  
Beyond them far  
  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
This by the light  
Of that same star  
Three wise men came  
From country far  
  
To seek for a King  
Was their intent  
And to follow the star  
Wherever it went  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
Born Noel

The day is ended little drummer boy  
Lights out was sounded long ago  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And dream of the ones that you love so  
  
Reveille will sound in the morning  
Once more on parade you will go  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And say goodnight to all your friends and foes.  
  
So close your eyes my little drummer boy  
And say goodnight to all your friends and foes.

We're off on the road to Morocco  
This camel is tough on the spine (hit me with a band-aid, Dad)  
Where they're going, why we're going, how can we be sure  
I'll lay you eight to five that we'll meet Dorothy Lamour  
(Yeah, get in line)  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hang on till the end of the line (I like your jockey. Quiet)  
I hear this country's where they do the dance of the seven veils  
We'd tell you more (uh-ah) but we would have the censor on our tails  
(Good boy)  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound  
  
We're off on the road to Morocco  
Well look out, well clear the way, 'cause here we come  
Stand by for a concussion  
The men eat fire, sleep on nails and saw their wives in half  
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh  
(Shall I slip on my big shoes?)  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hooray! Well blow a horn, everybody duck  
Yeah. It's a green light, come on boys  
  
We may run into villains but we're not afraid to roam  
Because we read the story and we end up safe at home (yeah)  
Certainly do get around  
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get  
In the corner drugstore for a dollar ninety-eight  
We're Morocco bound  
  
Or, like a volume of Omar Khayyam that you buy in the  
Department store at Christmas time for your cousin Julia  
We're Morocco bound  
(We could be arrested)
