Here I go again, my heart's on the line.  
I'm willing to pretend, one more time  
I got some life to spend, on even rhymes  
But when I reach the end, will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I know you're not the answer to my prayer  
And I have grown with each disappointment through the years  
And as bad as I am, and as bad as I am  
I'm still here  
  
On the road again  
I've paid a fine  
Where now is the friend  
I leave (I leave) I leave behind?  
  
I'm goin' 'round the bend  
One more climb  
But when I reach the end  
Will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still

A noblemen's fair daughter  
Came down a narrow lane.  
And met with Captain Wedderburn,  
The keeper of the game  
Now my pretty fair miss  
If it wasn't for the law,  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
Now, my dear good man, she said  
Do not be perplexed  
Before that you might bed with me  
You must answer questions six.  
Six questions you must answer me,  
And I will ask them all  
And you and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
What is rounder than a ring,  
And higher than the trees?  
And what is worse than a woman's curse,  
And what is deeper than the sea?  
What bird sings first, which one's best?  
Where does the dew first fall  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
The earth is rounder than a ring,  
And heaven is higher than the trees,  
The devil curse is worse than a woman's curse,  
And hell in deeper than the sea  
The lark sings first, the thrush sings best,  
Earth is where the dew falls  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
He takes her by her lily-white hand  
And leads her down the hall  
And he takes her by her slender waist  
For fear that she might fall  
And he lays her on a bed of down  
Without a doubt at all  
And he and she lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
And she and he lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall

You left in the morning  
You left without a word  
Did you get what you came for?  
Is this what I deserve?  
  
Oh I know  
The silence was the loudest thing  
I've ever heard  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication  
I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Did we have all we wanted  
And let it slip away in time?  
Like a country divided  
Fifty one to forty nine.  
  
Years ago  
I suppose we just can't seem to make up our minds  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Oh times like these it's hard to see  
With any kind of clarity  
What's the point of wondering anymore?  
So much I just can't figure out  
I'd love to know without a doubt  
For sure, for sure  
Where do we stand?  
What am I supposed to do?  
Give me the clearest indication I'm not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you (x4)  
From you.

I'm a young married man and I'm tired of life  
Ten years I've been wed to a pale sickly wife  
She's nothing to do, only sit there and cry  
Praying and praying to God she would die  
A friend of my own came to see me one day  
He told me my wife, she was pining away  
He afterwards told me that she would get strong  
If I get a bottle from dear Dr John  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh doctor, oh doctor, oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
I'm afraid of my life, I'll go down in the soil  
If me wife don't stop drinking your cod liver oil  
  
I bought her a bottle, well just for to try  
And the way that she drank it  
You'd think she might die  
I bought her another, it vanished the same  
And then she got cod liver oil on the brain  
I bought her another, she drank it no doubt  
And then she began to get terrible stout  
And when she got stout  
Well of course she got strong  
And I became jealous of dear Dr John  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My house it resembles a great doctor's shop  
It's covered in bottles from bottom to top  
Well early the morning the kettle does boil  
You would swear it was singing of cod liver oil  
  
Oh doctor, oh doctor, oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
I'm afraid of my life, I'll go down in the soil  
If me wife don't stop drinking  
  
[Chorus]

Many a truest word  
Has been spoken by the Jester  
Standing against the tide  
Is the noblest of gestures  
It's the little pearls of wisdom  
That tumble from the light  
That makes us laugh until we cry  
Because we know that they are right  
Within the strangest people  
Truth can find the strangest home  
So meet me in the village  
Where all we idiots go  
Bring on the Clowns  
The Jokers and Buffoons  
I've had the Time of my Life  
And the Life of my Times  
In the Company of Fools  
I'm wading through the quicksand  
In the gardens of the gentry  
Blooming vacuity  
Leaves mind and pockets empty  
In the Social Order  
I accept the bottom rung  
Until the wine is pouring  
And the Lord commands a song  
Meet me at the staff door  
When the posers all go home  
We'll gather with the other Fools  
And put on a proper show  
So here's to the Poorest Poet  
Who always pens the truth  
Players Writers and Gypsies  
The Minstrels and their tunes  
I'd rather live an honest lifetime  
With those with nothing to lose  
Than waste a night  
Knee deep in shite  
That's polished slick  
To look just right  
I'd rather live a lifetime in the  
Company of Fools  
Within the strangest people  
Truth can find the strangest home  
So meet me in the village  
Where all we idiots go  

Come all ye friends, I'll sit you down  
And sing an oleful ditty  
T'was on a day in April month  
We started from the city  
We planned a day or two at Mahers  
We stalwart men were chosen  
To remove old Charlie from Angle Pond  
Who fell in when the pond was frozen  
  
We seven men came roaring down  
On the road to Roaches Line  
We might have stopped in Avondale  
Or Brigus might have been fine  
We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in  
Nor took any time to park us  
We all of us knew that we must get through  
To remove old Charlie's carcass  
  
[Chorus]  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
Here's to Shave the Master  
No better horse ne'er ran the course  
Nor pulled the logs more faster  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
And I want ye all to know  
Charlie's gone to the big corral  
Where all good horses go  
  
In the car was Ol' Pocket Comb  
And beside him Old Moose Coosten  
And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark  
In the back seat he was roostin'  
There was Smiley Stubborn and the Mounted Police  
It wasn't hard to find him  
And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam  
Was sitting right in beside him  
Kevin and Buck was also there  
But they brought some brawn and brains  
They was aiming to help as best they could  
To remove old Chuck's remains  
Charlie was like a brother to Shave  
And he loved him well of course  
Charlie was a very good man you see  
Although he'd been a horse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'll spare you all the gruesome details  
And just relate the end  
With two stout doors and a few strong ropes  
We removed old Shady's friend  
We gave him a decent sendoff  
With all our hats removed  
So long as we helped old Shave and his friend  
Our loyalty was proved  
Somewhere up in the great beyond  
His eyes are shining bright  
Charlie nods an approving nod  
'Cause he knows we did him right  
Shave will join him there one day  
And he'll bring the harness leather  
And so for all of eternity  
They'll pull the logs together  
  
[Chorus]

Wouldn't it be great  
If no one ever got offended  
Wouldn't it be great  
To say what's really on your mind  
I've always said  
That all the rules are made for bending  
And if I let my hair down  
Would that be such a crime  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be  
Consequence free  
I want to be  
Where nothing needs to matter  
I want to be  
Consequence free  
Just sing  
Nananananananana  
Oh, nananananananana  
  
I could really use  
To lose my Catholic conscience  
Cause I'm getting sick  
Of feeling guilty all the time  
I won't abuse it  
Yeah, I've got the best intentions  
For a little bit of anarchy  
But not the hurting kind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I couldn't sleep at all last night  
Cause I had so much on my mind  
I'd like to leave it all behind  
But you know it's not that easy  
Oh, for just one night  
  
Wouldn't it be great  
If the band just never ended  
We could stay out late  
And we would never hear last call  
We wouldn't need to worry  
About approval or permission  
We could slip off the edge  
And never worry about the fall  
  
[Chorus]

Friday night, seventeen  
Got my hands on the wheel  
But my mind is on Jeen  
Her silhouette  
I can't forget  
I'm gonna ask her yet  
My brothers truck, my Sunday slacks  
I've been working all week  
And I've got five bucks for gas  
And just for luck  
My grandfathers flask  
It's gonna take some nerve to ask  
Dance, Dance with me one more time,  
One more time  
Dance, Dance with me one more time  
Before the band is done  
Before your Daddy comes  
Dance, Dance with me one more time  
She's the apple of his eye  
And there's no way in hell  
He'll let her out of his sight  
There'll be trouble  
Maybe a fight  
If he knew what I had in mind  
I see it now, as plain as day  
A church and a chaplain  
On our wedding day  
Dressed in white  
She looks so fine  
You never know, she just might  
I'm gonna have to ask her tonight

Hey, come this May,  
We'll be running in the sun again, your time will come.  
You're just a young broken heart.  
Been out sleepin' in the yard, how could you be so dumb?  
  
[CHORUS:]  
All we losers stand in line just waiting for our time.  
Broken angel take that plane and finger paint the sky,  
'Til everything shines,  
Everything shines,  
Everything shines,  
Everything shines.  
Hey broken clock,  
Hhaven't heard your old tick tocking man for much too long,  
And lonely jukebox,

(I need your song)  
  
[CHORUS]

Well it was on this Monday morning  
And the day be calm and fine  
A harbor grace excursion  
With the boys who had the time  
And just before the sailor  
Took the gangway from the pier  
I saw some fellow haul me wife  
Aboard as a volunteer  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry  
Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die!  
Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,  
"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"  
  
We had fourteen hundred souls aboard, oh what a splendid sight!  
Left strong and regimental to make our spirits bright  
And meself being in the double, when a funny things they'd say  
They choke themselves from laughing when they'd see us in the bay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green  
I fed her cake and candy, fat pork and kerosene  
Castor Oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed pure oil on her face  
And I said she'll be a dandy when we reaches Harbor Grace!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My wife she got no better, my wife me darling dear  
The screeches from her trolley could hear in Carbonear  
I tried every place in Harbor Grace,  
Tried every store and shop,  
To get her something for a cure or take her to the hop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She died below the brandy's as we were coming back  
We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in a Union Jack  
So now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face  
And the woman that says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbor Grace!  
  
[Chorus]

I had a dream I was moving forward  
Floating gently to the sun  
I've come to see my world rewarded  
A new day has begun  
  
A lost bird caught in mid migration  
Far away to a foreign land  
Offspring of a secret nation  
A new day has begun  
  
[Chorus]  
I can see the earth below me  
And I can  
Feel it turn  
  
Fog lifts to reveal potential  
For generations prophesied  
Our growth to be exponential  
Our promise finally realized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel it turn  
Across the sky  
The world it learns  
So must I  
  
Cut steel wired into water  
Fixed link, circumnavigate  
Old men see your sons and daughters  
No longer, no longer hesitate  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I stand in my doorway as the moon rises high  
Over glorious ocean, reflects the bright sky  
My heart it is aching, so much I could die  
I've known only the ocean, since I was a boy  
Chorus:  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to hide  
I fished with my father, so long long ago  
We were proud of our trade, and in us it did show  
We held our heads high, there was lots of fish then  
That was the time, when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster, we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled, we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people, will we ere be again?  
Chorus  
My father is gone now, and the fish are gone too.  
Abused and mis-managed, oh what can we do?  
I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,  
How will they know that we weren't the ones?  
Dfo regulations permitted the rape  
Of our beautiful ocean, from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers, they tore up our twine  
Politians don't care for what's yours or what's mine!  
Chorus  
You brave Newfoundlanders, now listen to me  
Shove the package to hell, go back to the sea  
If we don't stand our ground, we will fade away  
And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to die.  
Back to the sea.

(Traditional - Arr. Gbs)  
  
Well, they call me Hangin' Johnny  
Away boys, away  
Well, I never hanged nobody

Away boys, away  
Well, I never hanged nobody  
And it's hang boys, hang

As I rode ashore from my schooner close by  
A girl on the beach sir I chanced to espy  
Her hair it was red and her bonnet was blue  
Her place of abode was in Harbour LeCou  
Oh boldly I asked her to walk on the sand  
She smiled like an angel and held out her hand  
So I buttoned me guernsey and hoved way me chew  
In the dark rolling waters of Harbour LeCou  
  
My ship she lay anchored far out on the tide  
As I stroll along with that maid at my side  
I told her I loved her, I said I'll be true  
And I winked at the moon over Harbour LeCou  
As we walked on the sands at the close of the day  
I thought of my wife who was home in Torbay  
I knew that she'd kill me if she only knew  
I was courting this lassie in Harbour LeCou  
  
As we passed a log cabin that stood on the shore  
I met an old comrade I'd sailed with before  
He treated me kindly saying, Jack how are you  
It's seldom I see you in Harbour LeCou  
And as I was parting, this maiden in tow  
He broke up my party with one single blow  
He said, regards to your missus  
And your wee kiddies too  
I remember her well, she's from Harbour LeCou  
  
I looked at this damsel, a-standing 'long side  
Her jaw, it just dropped and her mouth opened wide  
And then like a she-cat upon me she flew  
And I fled from the furies of Harbour LeCou  
  
So come all you young sailors who walk on the shore  
Beware of old comrades you sailed with before  
Beware of the maidens with the bonnets of blue  
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour LeCou  
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour LeCou

I was just seventeen, when I made the AHL  
I couldn't skate in junior, but my fists rang like a bell.  
I'll never win a title, and I'll never win the cup,  
But when it comes to ladies, I've had the best of luck.  
  
My first one was a sly one, hanging round the rink,  
But they sent me off to Cornwall, as fast as you could blink,  
In Moose Jaw I was right in love, the daughter of the coach -  
He traded me for nothing, didn't take to my approach.  
  
So good-bye, fare thee well,  
There's no time for delay,  
You'll see me at the face-off, or catch the play-by-play  
So good-bye, fare thee well,  
I'm glad you shared my bed,  
But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head.  
  
Chantal was from Moncton, elle a jouer avec moi.  
A tongue as sharp as razors, but she had a fancy car.  
Her husband was a bruiser, played senior in Quebec,  
If he'd had the rights of it, it would have been my neck.  
  
Nancy couldn't watch me fight, she'd always be in tears,  
Waving from the bleachers, and screaming in my ears,  
Dee I should have married, and we had a dandy fling,  
But I had a one way contract, blew the money for the ring.  
  
I should have sent a letter, and it would have been polite,  
But I'm cleaning out my locker, and time is getting tight.  
I'm calling from the station, perhaps another day,  
Cause they're calling up a rookie, and they're trading me away.

In the midnight moon light hour  
I keep walking along that lonely mile  
And everytime I do  
I keep seeing this picture of you  
  
Chorus:  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now  
And it comes as no surprise to me  
With another guy  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now  
Walking with a love with a love that's oh so fine  
Never to be mine no matter how I try  
  
Oh you never walk alone  
And you're forever talking on the phone  
I try to call your name  
But everytime it comes out the same  
  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now (x4)

"It's a cold day for September", was all I thought to say  
When I saw you on the street the other day  
I knew something changed between us, all the talk we made was small  
But what do you say to someone when they've heard you say it all?  
It's an awkward conversation, in a most peculiar way...  
Chorus:  
How did we get from saying "I love you" to "I'll see you around  
Someday? "  
It seemed like only days ago, we had so much to say  
Did we take it all for granted?, did it all gets thrown away?  
"It calls for rain this afternoon", she finally replied  
Then there was such a stuttering silence, that I felt my mouth go dry  
We'll talk about the weather, cause there's not much more to say...  
Chorus x 2  
Has all the ice been broken,  
All our surfaces been scratched  
Have all the words been spoken,  
Have we finally met our match?  
Cause it's an awkward conversation,  
In a most peculiar way  
Chorus x 3

Though the night be dark as dungeon, not a star to be seen above  
I will be guided without a stumble, into the arms of me only love.  
I went up to her bedroom window, kneeling gently upon a stone  
I rapped on her bedroom window "My darling dear, do you lie alone"?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a rover , seldom sober  
I'm a rover of high degree  
Ans when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking  
How to gain my love's company.  
  
She raised her head up from her feather pillow, raised her arms up around her
breast,  
Saying "Who's at me bedroom window, disturbing me at me long night's rest?  
"It's only me, your own true lover, open the door and please let me in.  
For I have come on a long night's journey. I am near drenched to the skin".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She opened the door with the greatest pleasure, opened the door and she let me
in  
We both shook hands and embraced each other. 'Til the morning we lay as one.  
"Well now me love, I must go and leave you, though the mountains be high above  
Well, I will climb them with greater pleasure that I have been with me only
love".

Hey man, you don't know what you're missing  
You count your curses and forget about the blessings  
Don't you think you should learn a little lesson  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Hey man, what makes you so special  
Can't seem to find the angels for the devils  
Don't you think that if you learned to love a little  
You'd live a whole lot more  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it go, let it go  
This is smaller than you know  
No bigger than a pebble lying on a gravel road  
Let it go, let it go  
Got to leave it all behind you  
Give the sun a chance to find you  
Let it go  
  
Lift you head, there's no time for crying  
You made your bed but don't think its fit to lie in  
Wasted on the ground when you know you should be flying  
What are you waiting for?  
  
How can a man not see  
It seems so clear to me  
You've just got to live and learn  
Smile at the simple stuff  
This road ain't long enough  
To miss a single turn

(Traditional - Arr. Gbs)  
  
Well, I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been  
For three score or more in the little isle of green  
All over the Liffey and down to Segue  
I'm known by the name of auld Johnny Dhu  
  
Of all the trades a going, begging is the best  
When a man gets tired he can sit down and rest  
Singin' for his supper when there's nothing else to do  
When I come around the corner with me old rigadoo  
  
I went to a barn, went down to Currabawn  
Got down on the floor and I slept till the dawn  
Holes in the roof and the rain seeping thru  
Me toes froze together in me little beggar shoes  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie  
A nice old lady you will find by and by  
Buy a pair of leggings and I'll color them blue  
For a foxy old lady I'll make her too  
  
I met a little flaxen haired girl one day  
Good morning little flaxen haired girl, I did say  
Good morning little beggarman how do you do  
With your bags and your rags and your auld rigadoo  
  
Who should I waken but the woman of the house  
With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten so I said boo  
Sure, don't be afraid, it's only Johnny Dhu  
  
Over the road with me pack on me back  
Over all the fields with me big heavy sack  
Over the hills with the moon peeking through  
Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle on me auld rigadoo  
  
I must be going to bed, it's getting late at night  
The fire is all out, so out goes the light  
Now you've heard the story of the auld rigadoo  
So good night and God be with you, this is auld Johnny Dhu

Love Lalalala Love  
  
When we're together why does something always start  
Are we both better off when we are apart  
Someday's you hate me I can see it in your eyes  
It seems like lately you can't wait to criticize me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's alright, we don't have to fight tonight  
No, it's alright (repeat)  
  
Everyday I can hear the rockets fly  
Over the graves of too many who have died  
Fighting for land, or some ancient holy shrine  
I bet your blood runs red, just the same as mine, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bridge  
Love lalalala Love  
  
How many more of our children have to fall  
Just how high do we have to build these walls  
In fighting there's no dignity  
It's such a waste of time  
Take my hand,  
I don't think God will mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love

We've waited all this time  
This long and lonely time  
The light that trickles down  
It soaks into your eyes  
All I can send her  
The awkward pretender in this life  
I wonder if you'll love me tonight  
So delicate and lovely  
Wonder if you love me  
Are you on my side  
My dark and lonely side  
I'll make it worth your while  
I'll give you every reason why  
All we'll remember  
The simple surrender just in time  
You and I could wait and see  
A single note don't make a melody  
All together you and me  
A single note don't make a melody  
All I've been saying  
The one thing that's been weighing on my mind  

I see you in the front row, dancing up and down  
You're ripped and ready for the night downtown  
And all the pretty boys are chasing you around  
Cause they all wanna win your affections  
  
You spent three hours getting ready for the show  
Nothing on underneath and everybody knows  
Mama said wear a coat or catch your death of cold  
What's wrong with a little flirtation?  
  
[Chorus]  
And then you smile at me  
Is that a wink I see?  
Did I catch your eye?  
Should I even try?  
Oh, My Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need you (Margarita)  
  
Take your time, dance real slow  
Remember that song from the radio  
Got your old man's, got a place to go  
Cause we all need a little temptation  
  
Those two big fellas are looking for a fight  
It's what they like to do on a Saturday night  
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the lights  
But they just want to get your attention  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talk to me , baby, it's all right  
I might look strange, but I don't bite  
And if you let me hold your hand  
I can find a way to make you understand  
  
Called last call, now it's time to go  
But I'm not the guy who gets to walk you home  
We could have made history, I guess we'll never know  
I'll see you in dreams  
  
Oh, my Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need you (Margarita)  
Oh, my Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need You (Margarita)

There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari-Mac  
And make no mistake she's the girl I'm gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on the back.  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early.  
  
[Chorus]  
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me  
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac  
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.  
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.  
  
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together  
In fact you hardly see the one without the other  
And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother  
Or both of them together I'm courting  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Well I had a Bonnie lass sittin' on my knee  
A bumble bee stung me right above the knee  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I said to bonnie lass how we gonna pass the day  
She said among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wedding's on a Wednesday, everything's arranged  
Soon you'll never change your mind unless your mind is changed  
Of making the arrangements and feelings lots of rage  
Marriage is an awful undertaking  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sure to be a grand for grand of that a fair  
Gonna be a fork and plate for every man that's there  
And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share  
Although I may be very much mistaken  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac  
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on her back  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early  
  
[Chorus]

It's not the way that I intended this  
I didn't realize, how much I would miss  
But with every parting of our company  
I hate to think, what it has done to me  
  
[Chorus]  
You didn't see, that I was sorry  
This has to be, my apology  
  
When cruelty comes with blind indifference  
My humanity becomes my best defense  
But if you consider the alternative  
I really didn't have that much to give  
  
A tragic victim of my circumstance  
Never give the devil a second chance  
If you do you know that you never will  
Probably best to forget and begin again

Left my home and family by the ocean  
Out on my own, to seek my fortune  
But there is no work to occupy these young hands  
So look out boy you're heading for the mainland  
  
[Chorus]  
What do you do? You can't make nothing out of nothing  
Everybody needs a start  
What do you do? You can't make nothing our of nothing  
In my country back is heart.  
  
Well, I was born on a St.John's street  
Where all my hopes could meet with defeat  
I hide my fear in higher education  
Now I am so smart I could rule this content-nation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm alone but I'm working everyday  
I'm getting stoned and I'm blowing all my pay  
Just to survive I'll do whatever I can  
Now, I'm alive, but how can I be a real man?  
  
[Chorus]

There is an ancient party at the other end of town  
And he keeps a little grocery store, the ancients name is Brown  
And he has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw  
Oh I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law.  
  
Well, Old Brown he sells from off his shelf most anything you please  
He's got juice tarts for the little boys, lollipops and cheese  
And his daughter minds the store, and it's a treat just to see her serve  
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's old Brown's daughter is a proper sort of girl,  
Old Brown's daughter is a fair as any pearl  
I wish I were a Lord Mayor, a Marquis or and Earl  
And blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
Blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
  
Well, poor old Brown now has trouble with the gout,  
He grumbles in his little parlor when he can't get out  
Oh and when I make a purchase, lord, and she hands me the change  
That girl she makes pulverized, I feel so very strange  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word  
Ah but old brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord,  
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be  
But by jingo next election I will run for Trinity  
  
[Chorus]

There's a noble fleet of whalers  
They're sailing from Dundee  
Manned by British sailors  
That take them o'er the sea  
On a western ocean passage  
We started on the trip  
We flew along just like a song  
On a gallant whaling ship  
Was the second Sunday morning  
Just after leaving port  
We met a heavy sou'west gale  
And washed away our boat  
It washed away our quarterdeck  
Our stanchions just as well  
And so we set the whole shebang  
A-floatin' in the gale  
  
[Chorus]  
For the wind was on our quarter  
The engines working free  
There's not another whaler  
That sails the arctic sea  
Can't beat the Old Polina  
You need not try my sons  
We challenged all both great and small  
From Dundee to St John's  
  
Art Jackman set his canvas  
Fair Weather galloped steam  
And Captain Guy, the daring boy  
Came plunging through the stream  
And Mullins in the Husky  
Tried to beat the bloody lot  
But to beat the Old Polina boys  
Was something he could not  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's the noble terra Nova  
A model without doubt  
The Arctic and Aurora  
They talk so much about  
Art Jackman's model mail boat  
The terror of the sea  
Tried to beat the Old Polina  
On a passage from Dundee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're back in old St John's  
Where rum is very cheap  
We'll drink a health of Captain Guy  
Who brought us o'er the deep  
A health to all our sweethearts  
And to our wives so fair  
Not another ship could make the trip  
The Polina I declare  
  
[Chorus: x2]

It's takes a lot to get to the top  
And a little just to fall off quick  
And I think I've seen you here before  
  
Sometimes you fly so high  
So fast it makes you sick  
You won the battle, lost the war  
  
But I don't mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
[Chorus:]  
We came, we saw  
We conquered and crumbled  
In our own true way  
We loved, we fought  
We rocked and we tumbled  
In our own true way  
  
Well, I believe in brotherhood  
And the good of all mankind  
Though I admit it's hard to find  
  
But if you want to talk, just come and knock  
It don't matter what the time  
Solitude is no friend of mine  
  
And I don't mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mind  
It's hard to be from a rock in the sea  
Livin' in a big steel town  
Finding unfamiliar faces all around  
  
You heard 'em tell stupid jokes  
You heard 'em laugh every time you spoke  
But you don't let nobody put you down  
  
But I don't mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In our own true way  
And I don't mind  
If you say

Penelope works in the market  
Down in the coconut trees  
She's saving up all her money  
To go to America across the sea  
She once had an uncle  
He lived in Detroit town  
They got all his post cards  
But his body has never been found  
To this day  
To this day  
She got a job as a domestic  
Workin' for the minimum wage  
All her friends back home in Jamaica  
They say, 'You really got it made in the shade'  
But they don't see her sweat and grind  
And her bended on her knees  
She wishes she was back in Jamaica  
Beneath the coconut trees  
[Chorus]  
Everyday, Everyday  
Everyday, Everyday  
[Solo]  
[Chorus]  
Penelope's back in the market  
She found what it was all about  
Oh no, she doesn't regret it  
She's just glad that she got out  
But others aren't so lucky  
They're there till the day they die  
Trapped in steel and concrete  
No beach No moon No sky  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
[Chorus]  
  

Two recruiting sergeants came to the clb,  
For the sons of the merchants, to join the Blue Puttees  
So all the hands enlisted, five hundred young men...  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
They crossed the broad Atlantic in the brave Florizel,  
And on the sands of Suvla, they entered into hell  
And on those bloody beaches, the first of them fell...  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus:  
So it's over the mountains, and over the sea  
Come brave Newfoundlanders and join the Blue Puttees  
You'll fight the Hun in Flanders, and at Galipoli  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
The call came from London, for the last July drive  
"To the trenches with the regiment, prepare yourselves to die"  
The roll call next morning, just a handful survived.  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus  
  
The stone men on Water Street still cry for the day  
When the pride of the city went marching away  
A thousand men slaughtered, to hear the King say  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me  
  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me

I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
See chameleon lying there in the sun  
All things to everyone  
Run runaway  
  
If your in the swing  
Money ain't everything  
If your in the swing  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you got it sussed (to figure out)  
Don't beat around the bush  
If you got it sussed  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Oh now can't she wait?  
No no come on and wait  
Oh now can't she wait?  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

All eyes on Her from dawn till dusk  
Hanging on Her every word  
Kings and Queens never saw such a fuss  
Her Servants are waiting to serve  
  
Sally Ann Sally Ann  
Oh when you dance  
Every move that you make is amazing.  
Take my Heart Take my Hand  
Hey Sally Ann  
Life will be all that you make it.  
  
I must have got caught in your hair so bright  
Got lost in your eyes so blue  
I followed around in circles all night  
For a chance to dance with you  
  
It breaks my heart to hear her cry  
I'm a Fool for Her for sure  
See me swallowing my pride  
She got me crawling on the floor

When you're in love there's no time and no space  
There's a permanent smile on your face  
Your friends all complain that you're going insane  
But the truth is they're just afraid  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
When you decide that what counts is inside  
Your friends all say "It's a lie"  
But there's no brighter light than the look in her eyes  
When you're walking her home through the night  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
Let yourself go with the tide  
There's an angel by your side  
Tonight  
  
Back at the bar getting cynically stoned  
Your friends are drinking alone  
But it's funny, they don't even cross your mind  
When she asks you into her home  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares

She left St.John's one day in May  
Dressed in her Sunday best  
A kind man sat beside her  
While she cried her way out West  
She moved in with her cousin  
Found a job down in the mall  
Her friends at home were jealous  
Said they'd see her in the fall  
Chorus:  
You know that she wants to try, never lets you see her cry  
You know that she wants to try, she's got seagulls in her eyes  
The people here seem really nice  
But the winter's way too long  
New friends, they don't understand  
Her mother wrote "be strong"  
She made some decent money  
But nothing comes for free  
The windy street, just can't compete  
With the sky, the rocks and sea  
Chorus  
Her parents came at Eastertime  
They wanted her to stay  
But she bought a panel van  
Moved home on her birthday  
Her friends were pretty cynical  
"Couldn't make it on your own..."  
Now the sky's a little smaller  
And it doesn't seem like home  

Am I leaving you tomorrow,  
I can't see  
Is this how it's going to be?  
In the morning must I go,  
So let's take a little time,  
See what's on your mind  
Is there something I should know?  
  
I thought we went through all this yesterday  
You said you were OK,  
You just had to take it slow  
I'm tired of these little games you play,  
Are you here to stay  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there something I should know?  
  
I think everything we've seen,  
It was just a dream  
How did we get so low?  
To leave it all behind would be obscene  
Where's your self-esteem?  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can keep on talking,  
You know I've got all night  
But don't keep telling me,  
That everything's all right  
It's not all right.  
  
I'm leaving you tomorrow,  
Can't you see  
This is how it's got to be,  
In the morning I must go  
So let's take a little time,  
See what's on your mind  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]

I'm sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
  
My father phoned me yesterday  
Your time has come, well done my son  
Tried to think of what to say  
When words can heed already gone  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how I got here  
There must be something to it  
I think I need some time alone  
To work my way through it  
  
The moon is in the sky tonight  
Not very warm but it sheds some light  
Ask me now and I just might  
Let the morning come and tell me if its right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soon initial bliss will pass  
This precious time might be your last  
Like dew upon the morning grass,  
Good intentions can vanish with the sun  
  
I'm sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land

I don't mind confiding  
That I make stupid mistakes  
Been misled and misguided  
And I'm easily led astray  
  
But you can dance with disaster  
Never missing a step  
Spinning faster and faster  
Long after I've already slipped  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Over and over, again and again  
You float through the door and I'm stumbling in  
I'm twisted and tangled and soaked to the skin  
You float through the door and I'm stumbling in again  
  
Pulled in every direction  
I've a million regrets  
You're the perfect protection  
When I'm diving in over my head  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's bones in my closet,  
I've collected quite a few  
God knows what causes an angel to love a fool  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it  
  
[Chorus]

Chorus:  
And it's go boys go  
They'll time your every breath  
And every day you're in this place your two days nearer death  
But you go...  
  
Well, a process man am I and I am tellin' you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, I've worked among the spitters and I breathe the oily smoke  
I've shovelled up the gypsum and it neigh 'on makes you choke  
I've stood knee deep cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn  
Been working rough, I've seen enough to make your stomach turn  
  
Chorus  
  
There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore  
The young men like their money and they all come back for more  
But soon your knocking on and you look older than you should  
For every bob made on the job, you pay with flesh and blood  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, a process man am I and I am telling you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair  
  
Chorus (x2)

CHORUS:  
Oh won't you come along with me love  
Come along with me!  
Come for one night and be my wife  
And come along with me  
Well it is of the jolly butcher as you might plainly see  
As he roved out one morning in search of company  
He went into a tavern and a fair girl he did see  
Ah come for one night, be my wife, oh come along with me  
He called for liquor of the best  
And he makes such fortune play  
Come have a drink, it will make us think  
That it is our wedding day  
CHORUS  
Well he called for a candle to light their way to bed  
And when he had her in the room these words to her he said,  
"A sovereign I will give to you, for to embrace your charms"  
And all that night, that fair young maid, lied in the butchers' arms  
CHORUS  
Oh, Early the next morning be sure it went his way  
He looked unto that fair young maid and unto her did say,  
"That sovereign that I gave to you, do not think me strange,  
Well that sovereign that I gave to you will you give me back me change!"  
CHORUS  
Well about a 12 months later he roved out once more  
And he went into the tavern where he'd often been before  
He wasn't in there very long when his fair maid he did see  
And she brought forth a baby three months old and placed it on his knee  
When he saw the baby, he began to curse and swear  
And he said unto that fair young maid, "Why did you bring him here?!"  
"Well he is your own, kind sir", she said, "Do not think me strange,  
Well that sovereign that you gave to me, I gives you back your change!!"  
CHORUS x 2  

When I was a lad in a fishing town  
Me old man said to me  
You can spend your life, your jolly life  
Just sailing on the sea  
You can search the world for pretty girls  
Til your eyes are weak and dim  
But don't go searching for a mermaid, son  
If you don't know how to swim  
  
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her face it was a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
But I only like the upper part  
I did not like the tail  
  
I signed onto a sailing ship  
My very first day at sea  
I seen a mermaid in the waves  
A-reaching out to me  
Come live with me in the sea, said she  
Down on the ocean floor  
And I'll show you a million wondrous things  
You've never seen before  
  
So over I jumped and she pulled me down  
Down to her seaweed bed  
And a pillow made of a tortoise shell  
She placed beneath my head  
She fed me shrimp and caviar  
Upon a silver dish  
From her head to her waist  
It was just my taste  
But the rest of her was a fish  
  
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her face it was a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
But I only like the upper part  
I did not like the tail  
  
But then one day she swam away  
So I sang to the clams and the whales  
Oh, how I miss her seaweed hair  
And the silver shine of her scales  
But then her sister, she swam by  
Set my heart awhirl  
'Cause her upper part was an ugly fish  
But her bottom part was a girl  
  
Yes her hair was green as seaweed  
Her skin was blue and pale  
Her legs they are a work of art  
I love that girl with all my heart  
And I don't give a damn about the upper part  
'Cause that's how I get my tail

Hark, what's the noise out by the porch door?  
Dear Granny, there's mummers, there's twenty or more.  
Her old weathered face lightens up with a grin.  
Any mummers, nice mummers 'lowed in?  
  
Ah, come in lovely mummers, don't bother the snow,  
We'll wipe up the water sure after you go.  
And sit if you can upon some mummer's knee.  
We'll see if we knows who ye be.  
  
Ah, there's big ones and small ones, tall ones and thin,  
There's boys dressed as women and girls dressed as men,  
With humps on their backs and mitts on their feet,  
My blessed we'll die with the heat.  
  
Well, there's only one here that I think that I know,  
That tall fellow standing alongside the stove.  
He's shaking his fist for to make me not tell.  
Must be Willy from out on the hill.  
  
Ah, but that one's a stranger, if ever was one  
With his underwear stuffed and his trapdoor undone.  
Is he wearing his mother's big forty-two bra?  
I knows, but I'm not going to say.  
  
Well, I suppose you fine mummers would turn down a drop  
Of home brew or alky, whatever you got.  
That one with his rubber boots on the wrong feet  
Ate enough for to do him all week.  
  
Now I suppose you can dance? Sure they all nod their heads.  
They've been tapping their feet ever since they came in.  
And now that the drinks have been all passed around,  
Sure the mummers are plankin' 'er down.  
  
(Instrumental break - Bob plays one verse of Deck the Halls on the fiddle)  
  
Ah, be careful the lamp! Now hold on to the stove.  
Don't you swing Granny hard, 'cause you know that she's old.  
And never you mind how you buckles the floor  
'Cause the mummers have danced here before.  
  
Oh my God, how hot is it? We'll never know.  
Allows that we'll all get the devil's own cold.  
Good night and good Christmas, mummers me dears  
Please God, we will see you next year  
  
Ah, good night and good Christmas, mummers me dears  
Please God, we will see you next year  
  
Please God, we will see you next year.

I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one  
Trying to find the courage to talk to one  
I asked her for a dance  
Not a second glance  
My night had just begun  
  
Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost  
I'm kneeling at the alter of my nightly post  
So I'll raise a glass, not the first nor last  
Come join me in this toast  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because the old black rum's got a hold on me  
Like a dog wrapped round my leg  
And the old black rum's got a hold on me  
Will I live for another day?  
Hey, Will I live for another day?  
  
Well the queen of George street just went walking on by  
Walking on by with some guy who don't care  
That she stood in line  
Since half past nine  
And spent three hours on her hair (On her hair!)  
  
Well her friend is looking at me with an evil grin  
I think the bloody racket might soon begin  
I must have said some thing  
To the George street queen  
The boys are joining in!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So I drank all of my money  
And I slept out in the rain  
Everyday is different but the nights they're all the same  
You never see the sun on the old black rum  
But I know I'm gonna do it again!  
  
[Chorus:] 2x

I was just the age of sixteen  
When I first went on the drive  
After six months hard labor  
At home I did arrive  
I courted with a pretty girl  
T'was her caused me to roam  
Now I'm just a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll eat when I am hungry  
And I'll drink when I am dry  
Get drunk whenever I'm ready  
Get sober by and by  
And if this river don't drown me  
It's down I'll mean to roam  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
I'll build a lonesome castle  
Upon some mountain high  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go passing by  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go marching on  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I am old and feeble  
And in my sickness lie  
Just wrap me up in a blanket  
And lay me down to die  
Just get a little bluebird  
To sing for me alone  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home

Well I came into a scolding wife a few short years ago  
And ever since I lead a life of misery and woe  
My wife she is a tyrant around the ??  
Ah I'd sell her to the devil for a glass or two of gin  
  
Sure I'll get up and go to work as mild as any man  
And she'll get up and dress herself and go and have her dram  
And I chance to say a word it's well I know my due  
She'll follow me with the fire shovel up and down the room  
  
[Chorus]  
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain  
I swear to God I'll hang myself if I get married again  
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain  
Though I swear to God I'll hang myself if I get married again  
  
When I get up at breakfast time she'll tap me on the head  
When I come home at dinner time I'll find her drunk in bed  
When I come home at supper time at patience I must stop  
Cause she drinks what's in the teapot and I must drink the slop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well once I asked me scolding wife if I could go to bed  
She scare gave me an hour on the pillow to lay me head  
When like a roarin' lion she came bustin' down the door  
She caught me by the middle and threw me naked on the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now me and my companions go to a public place  
She'll search around the neighborhood until she finds my face  
She'll hoist me up in ridicule before the company  
Sayin' 'Petticoats is your master and forever more shall be'  
  
[Chorus:Repeatx3]

In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow  
We're up against troubles that few people know  
It's only by courage and patience and grit  
And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit  
The hard and the easy we take as they come  
And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs  
To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on  
I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
I knew that the ice grew weaker each day  
But still took the risk and kept haulin' away  
One evening in April, bound home with a load  
My mare showed some halting against the ice road  
She knew more than I did as matters turned out  
Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt  
She turned round her head with tears in her eyes  
As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives  
  
All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow  
For man is a stupid dumb creature you know  
And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh  
And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice  
I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice  
Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone  
I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond  
  
I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile  
And neighbors showed up in a very short while  
You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites  
To render assistance in all your bad plights  
To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives  
The same can be said for their children and wives  
And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast  
William White for a shanty song made a request  
There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay  
Straight from his heart came this song right away  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond

Hearken to me both high and low  
I'll sing for you a song  
Of Kings and Queens, and rose-lipped maidens  
Courting light foot lads  
  
Now love is grand, when love is new  
The heart blood, it runs strong  
There's nothing a doting lad won't do  
To keep his princess warm  
  
He'll tease her with poems and promises  
He'll ask her out to dance  
He'll cajole and he'll beg  
And he'll always win  
In bitter-sweet romance  
  
[Chorus]  
For time it comes, and time it goes  
It makes the strongest tree to bend  
Kings and Queens have no defence  
Time brings all things to an end.  
  
But he goes out, with his drinking pals  
His eyes begin to roam  
He forgets all about the brown-eyed beauty  
Who now, sits home alone  
  
There's no more walks, down lover's lane  
There's no more wine in the sun  
All that's left is a hollow pain  
Time, alas you've won  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now all who wish for love to stay  
And last your whole life through  
Keep ahead of time me boys  
And never be untrue  
  
[Chorus]

Tishialuk girls are neat and tidy, Tishialuk girls it won't last long,  
Tishialuk girls they will be useful when Sam Cove is dead and gone.  
  
Aunt Rae wants me to wed her daughter, takes me from my heart's delight,  
Give me a girl from down in Tishialuk , shines in the eyes like diamonds
bright.  
  
Tishialuk girls are neat and tidy, Tishialuk girls it won't last long,  
Tishialuk girls they will be useful when Sam Cove is dead and gone.

Is it just me, or a message from above?  
Bells are ringing, push has finally come to shove.  
The door before me now is open just enough.  
And I'm sick and tired of waiting for dreams that never come,  
And games I never played in, but still wish that I had won...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step, this is my walk on the moon.  
Don't you think their hands were shaking as that rocket ship touched down?  
I'm sure they shivered when they finally touched the ground.  
And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound...  
But it must have been amazing what a world they got to see.  
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now  
I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step this is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.  
Oh it must have been amazing, what a world they got to see!  
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize, not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step,  
This is my one small step,  
This is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.  

Only name Table Rogers a share man am I  
On a three-masted schooner from Twelingate Isle  
I've been the world over North, South, East and West  
But the middle of nowhere's where I likes it best  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year  
For she built me a home and raised my children D'ere  
She never come out to bid farewell to me  
Or can why a sailor must sail the salt sea  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Oh the work it is hard and the hours are long  
But my spirit is willing my back it is strong  
And when the works over the whisky will pour  
We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore  
  
I've sailed the world over for decades or more  
And oft times I wonder what I do it for  
I don't know the answer it's pleasure and pain  
But with life to live over I'd do it again  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
Ohh ohhhh

Well I was walking in the main land city  
And I was feeling so alone  
I was looking for someone or thing to remind me of my home  
What I wouldn't give to have somebody nod or wink at me  
Cause that's the way we say hello in my home down by the sea  
We never say "hello" or "how's it going?", "good day" or any of that  
We just look at them and nod our heads and wink say 'Whadd'ya At?'  
CHORUS:  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
But then I walked into a shopping mall and much to my surprise  
An old friend from my hometown was a sight for my sore eyes  
And of all the people I met down in the city or in the mall  
I think I like my hometown friend the best one of them all  
Because he didn't say "hello" or "how's it going today?" or any of that  
My old friend he just looked at me and smiled said "Whadd'ya At?"  
CHORUS x 2  
Let this be a lesson to all our people who go away  
Remember if you meet someone the special words we say  
We don't ever say "hello" or "how's it going?", "good day"  
Or any of that.  
You just look at them and nod your head now wink say "Whadd'ya At?"  
CHORUS  

Originally performed by Oysterband  
  
I am the fountain of affection  
I'm the instrument of joy  
And to keep the good times rolling  
I'm the boy, I'm the boy,  
You know the world could be our oyster,  
If you just put your trust in me,  
'Cause we'll keep the good times rollin'  
Wait and see, wait and see... Oh wait and see!  
  
There's exaltations, a sweet disintegrations  
There's a few discolourations, then it comes along  
You know up is what he chooses, the kisses and the bruises  
There ain't nothing he refuses, then it comes along  
It comes along, and I am lifted, I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus:  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Can't get down, can't get level  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Can't get down, can't get level  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
  
He just needs, something to bind him  
Something to wind him up  
It won't take long to find him  
When it comes on strong.  
  
Black skies are grinning, street lights are spinning  
The night is just beginning, and then it comes on strong  
It comes on strong, and I am lifted, I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh it comes on strong, and I am lifted.  
It comes on strong, and I am lifted.  
I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, I can't get down  
Oh no, no, no, no, no, I can't get down  
Oh-oh-oh I can't get down
