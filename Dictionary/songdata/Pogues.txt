Voici une histoire d'un homme cajun  
Amadie Adouin etat son nom  
Avec sa guitare et avec sa voix  
Amadie Adouin etait le roi  
In a town separated by railroad tracks  
When one side's white the other side must be black  
La sueur brulait dans ses yeux  
Les blancs ont crie n' arrete pas  
Quand Amadie pouvait plus jouer  
Il demandait a Celine son mouchoir  
Black were the tears Amadie Adouin cried  
Tears a white handkerchief just could not hide  
Les bois d'Arcadia Ils sont morts  
Au fond de la terre Amadie s'endort  
Mais si vous voulez ecouter sa voix  
Demande aux Ricains de la chercher d'en bas  
They ran right over Amadie's vocal cords  
Good old boys in a good ol' Model T Ford  
Amadie took a walk by the railroad track  
To the other side and he won't be coming back  
They ran right over Amadie's vocal cords  
Those good old boys in a good old Model T Ford  
Amadie took a walk by the railroad track  
To the other side and he won't be coming back  

The dawn shines her light to scare off the night  
The sun from his slumber is woken  
And the bells are ringing out as the town crier shouts  
Words too strong to be spoken  
There's a rumble in the ground and the air fills with sound  
Trumpets in the wind are a blowing  
And the townsfolk peep through the curtains of sleep  
To the sound of the cocks all a crowin'  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
The sun wears a smile and the clock winks its dial  
Clouds in the sky are unfolding  
And the birds on the wing like angels they sing  
The heavens are glowing all golden  
The crowds all spill out, they cheer and they shout  
Banners and flags are a waving  
And the flowers all a bloom, blow kisses to the moon  
As blossom falls on the paving  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
The whole world roars a chorus of applause  
Strangers from Delhi to Dublin  
Are swept off their feet as they kiss on the street  
And the waters like champagne are bubbling  
The winds may blow  
Come rain, come snow  
Today's for you and me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  
I gave my heart to you my love  
You gave your heart to me  

In the big city, where the lights are low  
Cold dirty ground, where the rivers don't flow  
Nothing's gonna change so throw it all away  
In the big city, where the kids will come cheap  
And monsters prowl and never sleep  
Don't cross the road if you haven't got the time of day  
Well, I lost my girl waitin' for the train from Ride  
I know she's out there somewhere  
Selling all we got but I don't mind  
In the big city, you can walk a thin line  
And your mother won't know that you do a bit of crime  
Your father's on the dole and he really hasn't got the time  
In the big city, where it's hard to see the sky  
Black earth trembles when the trains go by  
Bums on the corner tell you gently crawl up and die  
Well, I lost my girl and I missed my train to Ride  
And I'm stuck here sellin' papers  
And spittin' on the ground when you walk by  
Break  
In the big city, you can dance all night  
Only if you're clean and the lads are not uptight  
Or you may as well forget it until the broad daylight  
In the big city, where the suits don't look you in the eye  
Learn how to laugh, you'll be plannin' when to die  
Don't expect favours when the cars go passing by  
I lost my girl waitin' for the train from Ride  
Well, I don't mind matching colours or parkin' people's cars  
And telling little lies if that's alright  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city  

Billy ran around with the rare old crew  
And he knew an arsenal from Tottenham blue  
We'd be a darn sight better of if we knew  
Where Billy's bones are resting now  
Billy saw a copper and he hit him in the knee  
And he took him down from six foot to five foot three  
Then he hit him fair and square in the do-re-mi  
That copper won't be having any family  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
Billy went away with the peace-keeping force  
Cause he liked a bloody good fight of course  
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river Jordan  
Billy saw the Arabs and he had 'em on the run  
When he got 'em in the range of his sub-machine gun  
Then he had the Israelis in his sights, went a ra-ta-ta  
And they ran like Shiites  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
One night Billy had a rare old time,  
Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line  
Came back to camp not looking too pretty  
Never even got to see the holy city  
Now Billy's out there in the desert sun  
And his mother cries when the morning comes  
And there's mothers crying all over this world  
For their poor dead darling boys and girls  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
Have a Billy holiday  
Born on a Monday  
Married on a Tuesday  
Drunk on a Wednesday  
Got plugged on a Thursday  
Sick on a Friday  
Died on a Saturday  
Buried on a Sunday

Alligators snap at your ankles  
And branches snap at your brain  
If I ever get through this swamp alive  
I'll nevermore pray for rain  
This must be the place  
And still it somehow don't seem right  
Something in the moon could change  
These endless days to lonely nights  
I take a stroll down by the sea  
And walk along the pier  
Then I slip and hit my head  
Now's the time to fear  
I see the surface, see the rocks  
See my past fly swiftly by  
I feel the water in my lungs  
And wake up screaming for my life  
In my blue heaven  
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Card sharks and blue harps  
And dolphins who leap  
In my blue heaven  
Where I can laugh and I can weep  
Black shapes zip into corners  
The big lads start to crawl  
To holes of their own making  
In the cracks within the wall  
Snakes and rats and spiders  
I know that they're still there  
I pray to God that I may sleep  
Without a hope, without a care  
In my blue heaven  
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Felines and sea lions  
And rain on the beach  
In my blue heaven  
With angels who aren't out of reach  
In my blue heaven  
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Nightingales sing  
And the bells they will ring  
In my blue heaven  
The bells of Hell  
Go ding a ling a ling  

Thanks and praises  
Thanks to Jesus  
I bet on the Bottle of Smoke  
I went to hell  
And to the races  
To bet on the Bottle of Smoke  
  
The day being clear  
The sky being bright  
He came up on the left  
Like a streak of light  
Like a drunken fuck  
On a Saturday night  
Up came the Bottle of Smoke  
  
Twenty fucking five to one  
Me gambling days are done  
I bet on a horse called the Bottle of Smoke  
And my horse won  
  
Stewards inquiries  
Swift and fiery  
I had the Bottle of Smoke  
Inquisitions and suppositions  
I had the Bottle of Smoke  
  
Fuck the stewards  
A trip to Lourdes  
Might give the old fuckers  
The power of sight  
Screaming springers and stoppers  
And call out coppers  
But the money still gleams in my hand like a light  
  
Bookies cursing  
Cars reversing  
I had the Bottle of Smoke  
Glasses steaming  
Vessels bursting  
I had the Bottle of Smoke  
Slip a fifty to the wife  
And for each brat a crisp new five  
To give me a break on a Saturday night  
When I had the Bottle of Smoke  
Priests and maidens  
Drunk as pagans  
They had the Bottle of Smoke  
Sins forgiven and celebrations  
They had the Bottle of Smoke  
  
Fuck the Yanks  
And drink their wives  
The moon is clear  
The sky is bright  
I'm happy as the horses shite  
Up came the Bottle of Smoke

On the first day of March it was raining  
It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen  
I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there  
And I wish that all this raining would stop falling down on me  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
At the time I was working for a landlord  
And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen  
And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore  
And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
I recall we took care of him one Sunday  
We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls  
And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real  
But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
But now I've the most charming of verandahs  
I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores  
Five green bottles sitting on the floor  
I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ  
That I had fifteen more  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
The boys and me are drunk and looking for you  
We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn  
Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam  
And my brother earned his medals at Mai Lei in Vietnam  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
On the first day of March it was raining  
It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen  
Stay on the other side of the road  
'Cause you can never tell  
We've a thirst like a gang of devils  
We're the boys of the county hell  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning

The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
As the world is round, road is long  
Trouble on my mind  
I'll just keep on moving  
Till the day comes 'round  
Wind a' blowing on my back  
And my feet a' flying  
Flying down the road  
Where the bright lights shine  
Monday's in a pigtown  
Tuesday's in a truck  
Wednesday's a field of mud  
And Thursday's out of luck  
Friday's rain clouds  
Saturday flies by  
Sunday comes shining  
From a blue, blue sky  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some towns are golden  
Some towns are stained  
Some towns are shadows  
Fading in the rain  
Some towns are rust  
And some towns they gleam  
Some towns are mad dogs  
Some towns are a dream  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some dreams are hollow  
Some dreams are cold  
Some dreams are crazy  
And some dreams are bold  
Some dreams are bought  
And other dreams are sold  
Some dreams lie waiting  
At the end of the road  
Where the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
I said the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  

Now the party's over  
And the money's all gone  
You remember feeling like  
Jesus' son  
Your girl has left your side  
And now you're gonna get crucified  
  
They're gonna crucify you  
Crucify you  
Crucify you  
Crucify you  
In those old cotton fields back home  
  
Too late to joke or crack a smile  
You gotta carry  
That shit up that drunken mile  
When they put the electrodes  
In your brain  
Even your Mother won't know you're sane  
First Lord Nelson's sunken ships  
Now Steve Lillywhite's drunken mix

I've seen those signs a million times  
The chill that clouds your eyes  
The light that shines black as a coal  
Deep down in the mind  
And I'm hungry, and I'm dying of thirst  
Just suffering from a lover's curse  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
I've walked the line, stood by your side,  
I've kept you company  
And all those times you felt like crying,  
I've held you close to me  
Now someone's put a spell on me,  
All my worst dreams are coming true  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me  
  
Around the tent, the storm was raging,  
The gypsy's eyes were wild and blazing  
Should have listened when she said  
You'd slip away from me  
  
The bottle's empty, I've drunk it dry,  
And still I feel the pain  
Well, all we had is lost now,  
Like teardrops in the rain  
The night is long, I'm tired and weary,  
But I don't know where this road will lead me,  
I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me

Christy Brown  
A clown around town  
Now man of renown  
From Dingle to Down  
I can type with me toes  
Suck stout through me nose  
And where it's gonna end  
God only knows  
Down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
I have often had to depend upon  
The kindness of strangers  
But I've never been asked and I never replied  
If I supported the Glasgow Rangers  
And down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
Down all the days  
The tap-tap-tapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
And down all the days  

In search of a good life the Pilgrims set sail  
Then all through the new land they blazed their brave trails  
The iron horse speeding down freshly-laid rails  
Brought settlers determined to prosper  
  
From the far corners they made it their home  
The ities and germans, the paddies the poles  
Goin' down in the dirt comin' up with the gold  
Like Bill Fuller, the Kennedys and Corleones  
  
Life is so good in the us of A  
Live out you dreams in Amerikay  
If you've gut the guts and the bucks, it is said  
Every man is a king in the us of A  
Every man is a king in Amerikay  
  
The pilgrims these days they are called astronauts  
They seek new battlefields on the moon and beyond  
To wage their star wars in the sky by-and-by  
And to shit on us all from on high  
  
Then when it's all over and the world is no more  
When the White House and Kremlin have settled their score  
The stars and stripes flag will fly high, proud out there in space  
And that's why we all love the United States  
  
In the land of Republican automatons  
Uncle Sam's forces so gung-ho and bronzed  
Just waiting their orders from Washington  
To fight for your peace and your freedom  
  
Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador  
How foolish of you not to open your doors  
To the Hersheys, Budweisers, Mcdonalds and more.....  
This wonderful life could be yours

It was Christmas Eve babe  
In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me, won't see another one  
And then he sang a song  
The Rare Old Mountain Dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you  
  
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen to one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you  
So happy Christmas  
I love you baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true  
  
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas Eve  
You promised me  
Broadway was waiting for me  
  
You were handsome  
You were pretty  
Queen of New York City  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging,  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Were singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
You're a bum  
You're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  
You scumbag, you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy Christmas your arse  
I pray God it's our last  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
I could have been someone  
Well so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When I first found you  
I kept them with me babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells are ringing out  
For Christmas day

I recall the moment  
Before it slipped away  
When 5 green queens  
On a black bin bag  
Meant all the world to me  
  
And I recall the moment  
More distant than it seems  
When 5 green queens  
On a black bin bag  
Meant all the world to me  
  
And I recall the moment  
Much closer than it seems  
When 5 green queens  
On a black bin bag  
Meant all the world to me  
  
And I recall the moment  
Before it slipped away  
When 5 green queens  
On a black bin bag  
Meant all the world to me  
  
5 green queens and Jean

Four o'clock in the morning  
When the ambulance arrived  
Four o'clock in the morning  
When the ambulance arrived  
Blue light was flashing  
As they lay my baby down inside  
They took her to the hospital  
In the darkest hour of the night  
They took her to the hospital  
In the darkest hour of the night  
It was silent as the grave  
As my baby lay beneath the light  
They turned on the gas and cut her open  
She didn't feel no pain  
They turned on the gas and cut her open  
She didn't feel no more pain  
Daylight was breaking  
And down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  

The boys from the village were festering sore  
For a day on the rant with some music and more  
They'd drink porter in Maura's way over in fore  
And they never get drunk but stay sober  
There was Harry the banjo and Dunne of the swan  
With whose bone from the wing he'd beat the bodhran  
And the song that he'd sing was of ganders and all  
And they never get drunk but stay sober  
There was woods on the guitar and auld squeeze box too  
Who came from a time before aeroplanes flew  
He'd sit in a corner and mule quite a few  
And they never get drunk but stay sober  
There was Mahon the singer who knew all the songs  
And never was known to put a foot wrong  
He'd sing through the night till the break o' the morn  
And he'd never get drunk but stay sober  
Then Harry the banjo now there was a man  
A bottomless pit if ever there was one  
More porter he'd lower that there was in the land  
He'd never get drunk but stay sober  
The Gartloney Rats they play away  
They'd play for the pints and not for the pay  
And the pints they'd go down in the usual way  
And they'd never get drunk but stay sober  

Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream  
The girl from the wadi hammamat  
Lovely as a green parakeet  
I awake alone again  
In the desert of my dreams  
A fertile oasis i have seen  
  
I cast my voice to the burning winds  
Across the dunes khamsin khamsin  
Bring her to me on desire's wings  
On the burning desert wind  
  
She means the world to me  
In a single grain of sand  
Bring a camel to this man  
Perched on a bough her tresses hang down  
The girl from the wadi hammamat  
She is as sweet as a green parakeet  
  
Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream  
The girl from the wadi hammamat

Do you remember that sunny day?  
Somewhere in London  
In the middle of nowhere  
Didn't have nothing to do that day  
Didn't wanna do nothing anyway  
  
You got a way of walking  
You got a way of talking  
And there's something about you  
And now I know I never ever  
Want to be without you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
Of your precious love  
Of your precious love  
  
The first time I saw you,  
Standing in the street  
You were so cool,  
You could have put out Vietnam  
My girlfriends ask me, "What's he like?"  
I say, "He's kind of shy,  
But that's the kind of girl I am,  
He's my kind of guy"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll build my world around you  
I'll bless the day that I found you  
I'll stand beside you, I'll never leave  
Or tell you all those lies  
That you'd never believe

Sit down on that stool, hear the can't of a fool  
And a strange tale I'll tell to ye  
Of a time that I lived at the buff of a hill  
'Neath the burial chambers you see  
One Saturday night, I get up on me bike  
For to go to a dance in the town  
I set off at seven to be there for eleven  
No thought of the rain comin' down  
I pushed up the hill, the rain started to spill  
So for shelter I had to resort  
Helter-skelter I went as downhill I sped  
To the trees at the old fairy fort  
I pulled up me bike, be a tree in the gripe  
To find shelter out of the storm  
The rain it came down and like stones beat the ground  
It was grand to be dry in that storm  
I was dreamin' away about better days  
When a voice, it says, "Dirty old night"  
I fell over me bike, I got such a fright  
When the ghostly voice bid me the night  
But you jumped up with a start, gave the storm not a thought  
As the hail beat a rhythm on me  
And I stared at the tree that had spoken to me  
Not a body was there I could see  
I trembled and shook the tree, twisted and booked  
As the wind got into a scream  
And I grabed for me bike in that devil's owned night  
Expecting to wake from a dream  
The voice I had heard, not another word said  
As the hair on the head stood on me  
And I said an "Our Father" as I peddled much faster  
Away from that ghost haunted tree  
For weeks and weeks after with nerves a disaster  
Nowhere near that road would I go  
And from dusk through the night I would shake with the fright  
Of the tree that had haunted me so  
Now, whenever I go to a dance in the town  
I make sure not to stop on the way  
To be there for eleven, I still leave at seven  
But I go be a different way  

As Dorothy Parker once said to her boy friend,  
"Fare thee well,"  
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced,  
"It was swell, Isabelle, swell,"  
As Abelard said to Heloise,  
"Don't forget to drop a line to me, please,"  
As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear,  
"Romeo, why not face that fact, dear?"  
  
It was just one of those things,  
Just one of those crazy flings,  
One of those bells that now and then rings,  
Just one of those things.  
  
It was just one of those nights,  
Just one of those fabulous flights,  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings,  
Just one of those things  
  
If we'd thought a bit  
Of the end of it,  
When we started painting the town,  
We'd have been aware  
That our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down.  
So goodbye, Dear, and Amen.  
Here's hoping we meet now and then,  
It was great fun,  
But it was just one of those things

Oh Kitty, My Darling, remember  
That the doom will be mine if I stay  
'Tis far better to part, though it's hard to  
Than to rot in their prison away  
'Tis far better to part, though it's hard to  
Than to rot in their prison away  
  
So softly he kissed her pale lips  
'Twas the same story over an o'er  
Hush mavourneen, the police are watching  
And you know that I must go ashore  
Hush mavourneen, the police are watching  
And you know that I must go ashore  
  
In a day now I'll be over the mountain  
There'll be time enough left for to cry  
So good night and God guard you forever  
And write to me once you get by  
So good night and God guard you forever  
And write to me once you get by

My girl could break my heart  
And tear my soul apart  
Couldn't see myself living in a world  
Without her  
She's a tear, she's a scream  
Takes me high but my worst dream  
Could I survive living in a world  
Without her?  
My mommy said open the door  
I didn't want to be that boy  
All my friends told me I'd pull through  
But all that's said and all that's done  
Won't persuade me that I'm wrong  
I know I'd die living in a world  
Without her  
All my hopes and all my dreams  
Rest with her or so it seems  
I never want to see the world  
Without her  
She's a saint, she's a clown  
Picks me up when I'm down  
There'd be so much missing from the world  
Without her  
Tangled up in falling vines  
She took my hand, I know she's mine  
Pickin' up the pieces of the past  
Well, I awoke before the dawn  
Dreamed we'd fought and she had gone  
Now I know how it feels  
Without her  
An empty club, when we first met  
Sharing our last cigarette  
How could I have lived in a world  
Without her  
The sweetest girl I ever had  
She's the best, she must be mad  
There's no way I living in a world  
Without her  
We walked four miles to get back home  
Through the crowds we walked alone  
She told me all about her last stand  
The sun came up and lit the scene  
She looked so fine, so I see  
There's no way I'm living in a world  
Without her  
There ain't no way I am living in a world  
Without her  
There's just no way I am living in a world  
Without her  

The devil moon took me through the alley  
Down by the Kardomah and the Centrale  
To the mews running through the backstreets  
Where the Blacks sold fire and sleep  
The devil moon took me out of Soho  
Up to Camden where the cold north winds blow  
Sucked along by a winter shower  
To stand beside your shining tower  
This could be our final dance  
This could be our very last chance  
Just the sound of your voice  
Wherever I may be changes everything  
And then the world's all right with me  
You're my London girl  
The way that you walk  
You're my London girl  
The way that you talk  
Just the sound of your voice  
And I ain't got no choice  
The light was going out, the moon was dying  
The night was turning to a fine spring morning  
The dogs were barking and the kids were shouting  
The sun was splashing in a crystal fountain  
When the cold winds come and find you  
Blowing down from the top of the high rise  
I'll come and take you back down to Soho  
Away from all those mad men's eyes  
This could be our final dance  
This could be our very last chance  
And if you cut me, don't you think I feel  
Is this body made of clay, is this heart made of steel  
You're my London girl  
The way that you walk  
You're my London girl  
The way that you talk  
Just the sound of your voice  
And I ain't got no choice  
This could be our final dance  
This could be our very last chance  
And if you cut me, don't you think I feel  
Is this body made of clay, is this heart made of steel  
You're my London girl  
The way that you walk  
You're my London girl  
The way that you talk  
Just the sound of your voice  
And I ain't got no choice  

Ah London you're a lady  
Laid out before my eyes  
Your heart of gold it pulses  
Between your scarred up thighs  
Your eyes are full of sadness  
Red busses skirt your hem  
Your head-dress is a ring of lights  
But I would not follow them  
Your architects were madmen  
Your builders sane but drunk  
Among your faded jewels  
Shine acid house and punk  
  
You are a scarlet lady  
Your streets run red with blood  
Oh my darling they have used you  
And covered you with mud  
It was deep down in your womb my love  
I drank my quart of sin  
While chinamen played cards and draughts  
And knocked back mickey finns  
  
Your piss is like a river  
Its scent is beer and gin  
Your hell is in the summer  
And you blossom in the spring  
September is your purgatory  
Christmas is your heaven  
And when the stinking streets of summer  
Are washed away by rain  
At the dark end of a lonely street  
That's where you lose your pain  
'Tis then your eyes light up my love  
And sparkle once again

Ignacio lay dying in the sand  
A single red rose clutched in a dying hand  
The women wept to see their hero die  
And the big black birds gathered in the sky  
Mother of all our joys  
Mother of all our sorrows  
Intercede with him tonight  
For all of our tomorrows  
The years went by and then the killers came  
And took the men and marched them up the hill of pain  
And Lorca, the faggot poet they left till last  
Blew his brains out with a pistol up his arse  
Mother of all our joys  
Mother of all our sorrows  
Intercede with him tonight  
For all of our tomorrows  
The killers came to mutilate the dead  
But ran away in terror to search the town instead  
But Lorca's corpse, as he had prophesied, just walked away  
And the only sound was the women in the chapel praying  
Mother of all our joys  
Mother of all our sorrows  
Intercede with him tonight  
For all of our tomorrows  

POGUES - LORELEI  
  
You told me tales of love and glory  
Same old sad songs, same old story  
The sirens sing no lullaby  
And no-one knows but Lorelei.  
  
By castles out of fairytales  
Timbers shivered where once there sailed  
The lovesick men who caught her eye  
And no-one knew but Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see...  
  
I've thought of you in far-off places  
I've puzzled over lipstick traces  
So help me god, I will not cry  
And then I think of Lorelei.  
  
I travel far and wander wide  
No photograph of you beside me  
Ol' man river's not so shy  
And he remembers Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see.  
  
If I should float upon this stream  
And see you in my madman's dream  
I'd sink into your troubled eyes  
And none would know 'cept Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see.  
  
But if my ship, which sails tomorrow  
Should crash against these rocks,  
My sorrows I will drown before I die  
It's you I'll see, not Lorelei

I just want to see you  
When you're all alone  
I just want to catch you if I can  
I just want to be there  
When the morning light explodes  
On your face it radiates  
I can't escape  
I love you 'till the end  
  
I just want to tell you nothing  
You don't want to hear  
All I want is for you to say  
Oh why don't you just take me  
Where I've never been before  
I know you want to hear me  
Catch my breath  
I love you 'till the end  
I love you 'till the end  
  
I just want to be there  
When we're caught in the rain  
I just want to see you laugh, not cry  
I just want to feel you  
When the night puts on it's cloak  
I'm lost for words, don't tell me  
'Cause all I can say  
I love you 'till the end  
  
All I can say  
I love you 'till the end

As I walked down by the riverside  
One evening in the spring  
Heard a long gone song  
From days gone by  
Blown in on the great North wind  
  
Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry  
Of sorrow and delight  
You can hear the cars  
And the shouts from bars  
And the laughter and the fights  
  
May the ghosts that howled  
Round the house at night  
Never keep you from your sleep  
May they all sleep tight  
Down in hell tonight  
Or wherever they may be  
  
As I walked on with a heavy heart  
Then a stone danced on the tide  
And the song went on  
Though the lights were gone  
And the North wind gently sighed  
  
And an evening breeze coming from the East  
That kissed the riverside  
So I pray now child that you sleep tonight  
When you hear this lullaby  
  
May the wind that blows from haunted graves  
Never bring you misery  
May the angels bright  
Watch you tonight  
And keep you while you sleep

As I was walking down the road  
A feeling fine and larky oh  
A recruiting sergeant came up to me  
Says he you'd look fine in khaki oh  
  
For the King he is in need of men  
Come read this proclamation oh  
A life in Flanders for you then  
Would be a fine vacation now  
  
That maybe so says I to him  
But tell me sergeant dearie-oh  
If I had a pack stuck upon my back  
Would I look fine and cheerie oh  
  
For they'd have you train and drill until  
They had you one of Frenchies oh  
It may be warm in Flanders  
But it's draughty in the trenches oh  
  
The sergeant smiled and winked his eye  
His smile was most provoking oh  
He twiddled and twirled his wee moustache  
Says he I know you're only joking oh  
  
For the sandbags are so warm and high  
The wind you won't feel blowing oh  
Well I winked at a cailin passing by  
Says I what if it's snowing oh  
  
Come rain or hail or wind or snow  
I'm not going out to Flanders oh  
There's fighting in Dublin to be done  
Let your Sergeants and your Commanders go  
  
Let Englishmen fight English wars  
It's nearly time they started oh  
I saluted the Sergeant a very good night  
And there and then we parted oh  
  
As I went down to Galway Town  
To seek for recreation on the 17th of August  
Me mind being elevated  
There were passengers assembled  
  
With their tickets at the station  
And me eyes began to dazzle  
And they off to see the races  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
There were passengers from Limerick  
And passengers from Nenagh  
The boys of Connemara  
And the Clare unmarried maiden  
  
There were people from Cork City  
Who were loyal, true and faithful  
Who brought home the Fenian prisoners  
From dying in foreign nations  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
And it's there you'll see the pipers  
And the fiddlers competing  
And the sporting wheel of fortune  
And the four and twenty quarters  
  
And there's others without scruple  
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie  
And her father well contented  
And he gazing at his daughter  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
And it's there you'll see  
The jockeys and  
They mounted on so stably  
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green  
  
The colours of our nation  
The time it came for starting  
All the horses seemed impatient  
Their feet they hardly touched the ground  
The speed was so amazing!  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
There was half a million people there  
Of all dominations  
The Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew  
The Presbyterian  
  
Yet no animosity  
Not matter what persuasion  
But failte hospitality  
Inducing fresh acquaintance  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day

Mary's sellin' flowers on a stall in EC1  
Tonight she'll be out lookin' for some fun  
Her mate, Gerry's in the basement, he hasn't got a home  
But prides himself that he's got most things done  
Meanwhile, I'm up on the roof  
Waitin' for the sun to shine  
I haven't got an excuse  
So, I'll just keep my head down  
David's in the city, he's just made a deal  
And the boys they want to take his trousers down  
So they buy some little pills which will make poor David ill  
And they find themselves in some club downtown  
Meanwhile, I got off the roof  
'cause the rain keeps pouring down  
And I haven't got a clue  
Why there's faith in all these clowns  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
Jim and Jane hit the grapevine 'cause they're lookin' for a party  
A secret number knows where it can be found  
So they pick up Pete and Sheila, then they head down the M40  
But someone said they closed the country down  
Meanwhile, I've locked myself in the kitchen  
Waitin' for the storm to pass  
And if there's too much damage  
I think I'll get the fuck out fast  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  

It was 1962 and I was  
Two years out of school  
When I got on board a boat  
That was bound for Liverpool  
The day we sailed away  
I remember it so well  
Took one look at the North Wall  
And bid a fond farewell  
  
It's a hard thing to leave the land  
Of your childhood  
Touched by the rivers  
And kissed by the sea  
The places you played  
With your childhood companions  
To leave dear old Ireland and  
Mother Mo Chroi  
  
Though I'm going far away  
And I may never return here  
There is always one thing  
That I'll keep within me  
Deep in my heart a furious devotion  
The love of old Ireland  
And Mother Mo Chroi  
  
At the top of Pentonville Road  
I saw the sun setting  
The town laid out before me  
Looked beautiful to me  
Away from all the sighing  
The suffering and dying  
I dreamed of the future  
The young and the free  
  
But the years they go by quickly  
Now I know I can't remain here  
Where each day brings me closer  
To that final misery  
My kids will never scrape shit round here  
And I won't die crying in a pint of beer  
I'm going back to Ireland  
And my Mother Mo Chroi

In the days when I was courtin'  
I was seldom done resortin'  
In the ale house and the playhouse  
And many's the house between  
I told me brother Seamus  
I'll go off and get right famous  
And when I come back home again  
I'll have seen the whole wide world  
And it's goodbye, Muirshin Durkin  
I'm sick and tired of workin'  
I'll no more dig the praties  
I'll no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
I'll go off to California  
And instead of digging praties  
I'll be digging lumps of gold  
Farewell to all the girls at home  
I'm bound away across the foam  
Off to seek me fortune  
In far Amerikay  
There's silver there a-plenty  
For the poor and for the gentry  
And when I come back home again  
I never more will say  
Goodbye, Muirshin Durkin  
I'm sick and tired of workin'  
I'll no more dig the praties  
I'll no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
I'll go off to California  
Where instead of diggin' praties  
I'll be digging lumps of gold  
And goodbye, Muirshin Durkin  
I'm sick and tired of workin'  
I'll no more dig the praties  
I'll no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
I'll go off to California  
Where instead of diggin' praties  
I'll be digging lumps of gold  
Goodbye, Muirshin Durkin  
I'm sick and tired of workin'  
I'll no more dig the praties  
No more be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
I'll go off to California  
Where instead of diggin' praties  
I'll be diggin' lumps of gold  

The night stank of diesel  
A stranger came to town  
A cold wind blowing  
And the rain pouring down  
Street lights flicker  
And the power lines moan  
The moon beat down  
On a river of bone  
Someone put the lights out  
No one make a sound  
You won't find a thing  
Down in Oretown  
Foundry spits fire and smoke  
Air's foul and choking  
Sky is full of sulphur  
Hills flat and broken  
Black fogs and whirlwinds  
The thunder and rain  
Open drink madness  
Purple mad pain  
The circus is over  
Exit the clowns  
Nobody's laughing  
Down in Oretown  
The ship's in the harbor  
Cargo's been pawned  
Barrooms spilling sailors  
All shipwrecked at dawn  
Smelling of salt and rust  
Uniform's torn  
Came looking for flowers  
Only found thorns  
Dreaming of mermaids  
In pearly white gowns  
Captain is sleeping  
Down in Oretown  
There's a man down on mainstreet  
Eyes all aflame  
Laughing in the thunder  
Of the Number 9 train  
Selling old postcards in rusty frames  
A thousand views of Oretown  
And they all look the same  
Dressed up in sandals  
A barbed wire crown  
A lot of people lost their minds  
Down in Oretown  
Lock up the lawman  
Let go the thief  
Round up the grey men  
Nail them to a tree  
This town was a palace  
This town was aglow  
Well, the sky burned orange  
And the iron river flowed  
The night stank of diesel  
A stranger came to town  
The night folded over  
Down in Oretown  

The City of Light is dimmed now by the winter,  
No gut full of wine could keep out this frost  
We'll shiver and sigh by the ice on the river  
Ask the dull heavens, "The hell have we lost?"  
  
My heart's too empty to speak true of sorrow  
What's dust is but dust and as dust shall remain  
If only I could, I would make it tomorrow,  
I'd make it tomorrow where you'd live again  
  
I'll lay myself down in the mist and the heather  
I'll lay myself down and I'll wait for your call  
The bell rings last orders, we're walking together  
While the boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
  
My heart's too empty to speak true of sorrow  
What's dust is but dust and as dust shall we fall  
The bell rings last orders, we're walking together  
While the boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall

In eighteen hundred and forty-one  
The corduroy breeches I put on  
Me corduroy breeches I put on  
To work upon the railway, the railway  
I'm weary of the railway  
Poor Paddy works on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-two  
From Hartlepool I moved to Crewe  
Found myself a job to do  
A working on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches, pulling switches  
Dodging pitches, as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-three  
I broke the shovel across me knee  
I went to work for the company  
On the Leeds to Selby railway  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches, pulling switches  
Dodging pitches, as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-four  
I landed on the Liverpool shore  
My belly was empty me hands were raw  
With working on the railway, the railway  
I'm sick to my guts of the railway  
Poor Paddy works on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-five  
When Daniel O'Connell he was alive  
When Daniel O'Connell he was alive  
And working on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches, pulling switches  
Dodging pitches, as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-six  
I changed my trade to carrying bricks  
I changed my trade to carrying bricks  
To work upon the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches, pulling switches  
Dodging pitches, as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and forty-seven  
Poor Paddy was thinking of going to heaven  
The old bugger was thinking of going to heaven  
To work upon the railway, the railway  
I'm sick to my death of the railway  
Poor paddy works on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches, pulling switches  
Dodging pitches, as I was  
Working on the railway

I'll be with them asleep and dreaming  
I'll be there when they wake with screaming  
At the hour of death then I will nurse them  
To have a moment more to curse them  
Watch the maggots crawl out of them  
Hear the angels call above them  
Watch them as the cold air sucks them  
Down to hell, goodnight, God love them  
If any should escape above me  
Beg and cheat until they trust me  
Drag them down to be damned with me  
Laugh at them as they forgive me  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds,  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight  
Yigh!  
  
I wish that they could walk forever,  
On the earth, alone, unfettered  
Til they pray for consolation,  
Til they beg for sweet damnation  
Then I'll come and bring them water,  
Bring them hope, bring them laughter  
Raise their hopes so sad and sunken  
Slash them up as they lie there drunken  
Push them down into the foul mud  
'Til they choke up on their own blood  
Drag them out before their last breath  
To take away the mercy of death  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight  
Yigh!  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the Gates of Hell tonight  
  
Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds  
Still the moon shows no light  
This rose is withered, may God deliver  
The rake at the gates of hell tonight

As I was walking down the road  
A feeling fine and larky oh  
A recruiting sergeant came up to me  
Says he, you'd look fine in khaki oh  
For the King he is in need of men  
Come read this proclamation oh  
A life in Flanders for you then  
Would be a fine vacation oh  
  
That may be so says I to him  
But tell me sergeant dearie-oh  
If I had a pack stuck upon my back  
Would I look fine and cheerie oh  
For they'd have you train and drill until  
They had you one of the Frenchies oh  
It may be warm in Flanders  
But it's draughty in the trenches oh  
  
The sergeant smiled and winked his eye  
His smile was most provoking oh  
He twiddled and twirled his wee mustache  
Says he, I know you're only joking oh  
For the sandbags are so warm and high  
The wind you won't feel blowing oh  
Well I winked at a cailin passing by  
Says I, what if it's snowing oh  
  
Come rain or hail or wind or snow  
I'm not going out to Flanders oh  
There's fighting in Dublin to be done  
Let your sergeants and your commanders go  
Let Englishmen fight English wars  
It's nearly time they started oh  
I saluted the sergeant a very good night  
And there and then we parted oh

Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born  
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn  
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn  
And they all looked very happy in the morning  
  
Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours  
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks  
When he'd had too many powers  
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving  
And he took the road for god knows in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man  
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane  
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn  
And ended up a barman in the morning  
  
I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down  
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown  
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away  
And some people left for heaven without warning  
  
We walked them to the station in the rain  
We kissed them as we put him on the train  
And we sang them a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing them again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone  
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on  
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked  
And he took the road for heaven in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane

OK, it's time for Sayonara  
So long yankee break my heart  
Now there's nothing left but sorrow  
Even the best friends they must part  
  
I walked into the nearest bar  
I sat and gazed across the sea  
I wandered lonely on the beach  
The waves just whispered misery  
  
She had a red red scarf  
Around her neck  
Her eyes were green  
Her hair was black  
She had a red red scarf  
Around her neck  
Her eyes were green  
Her hair was black  
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey  
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu  
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey  
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu  
  
(Som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)  
  
I got new papers in a bordello  
With some luckies and my I.D.  
My heart was pounding like a hammer  
Thai Thai Thai Thai Thai! I am free  
  
She kissed me softly on the lips  
She took my hand without a sound  
This was our happy ever after  
So motherfucker kiss the ground

Dear dirty London in the pouring rain  
I wish to God I was back on the sea again  
Though that belongs to the world of never will be  
There was never a wilder bastard than me on the sea  
I could fuck all the whores in damnation me boys  
Though they wriggled and hollered and made a great noise  
Then I'd drink till I stank and then drink plenty more  
And I won't go down to the sea any more  
But if I had ten pounds then I'd raise a loud cheer  
And I'd toast all me neighbours both distant and dear  
And I'd shoot back great belly-crippling buckets of beer  
And a pox and a curse on the people round here  
Wouldn't give you me the price of a half pint of beer  
Wouldn't give you me the price of a cup of good cheer  
A pox and a curse on the people round here  
  
A man's ambition must indeed be small  
To write his name upon a shithouse wall  
But before I die I'll add my regal scrawl  
To show the world I'm left with sweet fuck all  
And when all of us bold shithouse poets do die  
A monument grand they will raise to the sky  
A monument made just to mark our great wit  
A monument of solid shit now me boys  
I met with Bill James we fought over crusts  
I called him a whore and he booted me crotch  
Then we shared out the jack and we thought it a treat  
The compliments pass when the quality meet  
The compliments pass when the quality meet  
The compliments pass when the quality meet  
The compliments pass when the quality meet

Sit down by the fire  
And I'll tell you a story  
To send you away to your bed  
Of the things you hear creeping  
When everyone's sleeping  
And you wish you were out here instead  
  
It isn't the mice in the wall  
It isn't the wind in the well  
But each night they march  
Out of that hole in the wall  
Passing through on their way  
Out of hell  
  
They're the things that you see  
When you wake up and scream  
The cold things that follow you  
Down the boreen  
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill  
Up at the top of the field  
  
And they dance on the rain  
And they dance on the wind  
They tap on the window  
When no-one is in  
And if ever you see them  
  
Pretend that you're dead  
Or they'll bite off your head  
They'll rip out your liver  
And dance on your neck  
They dance on your head  
They dance on your chest  
They give you the cramp  
And the cholic for jest  
  
They're the things that you see  
When you wake up and scream  
The cold things that follow you  
Down the boreen  
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill  
Up at the top of the field  
  
They play on the wind  
They sing on the rain  
They dance on your eyes  
They dance in your brain  
  
Remember this place  
It is damp and it's cold  
The best place on earth  
But it's dark and it's old  
So lie near the wall  
And cover your head  
Good night and God bless,  
Now fuck off to bed

Well it's been a long day but i don't like to moan  
It's the middle of summer and i'm chilled to the bone  
There's holes in my shoes where the rain comes in  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks  
I was talking to a stranger and he's on the rocks  
Down on the pavement living in a box  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no can't anybody see  
It's been a bad day and i want a little peace  
  
Oh no won't you please help me  
I want to lie down but there's no beds free  
  
Down on the corner there's starry eyed preachers  
Rattling cans and pimping jesus  
There's madmen on boxes makig speeches  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
You can't sit in the sunshine or go out after dark  
There's dogs on the loose acting like sharks  
There's psychos on the streets burning winos in the park  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i wish i was gone  
I want to get going before too long  
  
Oh no i want to leave town  
But i can't drive my car 'cause they put it in the pound  
  
The masters of industry are killing for oil  
There's poison in the air the water and the soil  
We're all turning mutant they're counting up their spoils  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
I turn on the tv and it makes me want to cry  
There's killing and there's torture there's destruction and there's lies  
And our leaders talk rubbish and more people die  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Oh no i can't take anymore  
I'm shaking all over and my nerves are all raw  
  
Oh no my head's a little sore  
I want to get out but i can't find the door

O-we-o-o  
Six to go  
O-we-o-o  
Never gonna let go  
O-we-o-o  
Nothing new  
O-we-o-o  
Don't believe it's true  
O-we-o-o  
On a Sunday  
O-we-o-o  
All because of London  
O-we-o-o  
Hear the song  
O-we-o-o  
Right the wrong  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
Set a precedent  
O-we-o-o  
Try a little bit  
O-we-o-o  
Make a family  
O-we-o-o  
Set our fathers free  
O-we-o-o  
Hear the song  
O-we-o-o  
Right the wrong  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  

I close the door and turn the key  
And dream a world for you and me  
Beyond the walls, a city breathes  
In this room one heart beats  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
On the street, ten floors below  
The city lights are all aglow  
The corner girls, they come and go  
Dreaming of a ticket home  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
I'll have a drink and then we'll see  
If the spirit conjures your genie  
To lie beside me in my dreams  
The wind is blowing a melody  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
Close the door and turn the key  
And now that you're alone with me  
We'll sit up late and watch TV  
The neon flashes red and green  
Oh, the stars, they shine for you and me  

The shaman came a calling  
He was howling at the moon  
He offered me a vision  
On the end of a silver spoon  
He said he'd give me dreams  
That all were in his powers  
If only i would follow him  
The universe was ours  
  
Walked a thin white line to the coffin club  
Downstairs from the devils den  
Had a large double Jesus  
Chased down with a shot of zen  
The last thing i remember  
Was lying in the tank  
And when i came around again  
Everything was blank  
  
Floating high above the world  
Out on the astral plane  
I'm bouncing like a pinball  
He's busy being born again  
  
I met god on primrose hill  
That's where he came to me  
He stepped out of his saucer  
I got down on my knees  
From his lips came just one word  
He left me all aglow  
I sat down and had a smoke  
And watched the flowers grow  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The secret of the universe  
Is hidden in this song  
  
The shaman left a crawling  
As the dawn broke the gloom  
Talking in some other tongue  
And laughing like a loon  
The early morning sunlight  
Splashed colours on the wall  
And i don't know if it ever  
Really happened at all  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The molecules inside my head  
Are chiming like a gong  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The secret of the universe  
Is hidden in this song

In South Australia I was born, heave away, haul away  
In South Australia, 'round Cape Horn, we're bound for South Australia  
  
Haul away your rolling king, heave away, haul away  
Haul away, you'll hear me sing, we're bound for South Australia  
  
As I walked out one morning fair, heave away, haul away  
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair, we're bound for South Australia  
  
There's just one thing that's on my mind, heave away, haul away  
That's leaving Nancy Blair behind, we're bound for South Australia  
  
And as we wallop round Cape Horn, heave away, haul away  
You'll wish to God you've never been born, we're bound for South Australia  
  
In South Australia I was born, heave away, haul away  
In South Australia, 'round Cape Horn, we're bound for South Australia

Last night as I slept  
I dreamt I met with Behan  
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day  
When questioned on his views  
On the crux of life's philosophies  
He had but these few clear and simple words to say  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
I have cursed, bled and sworn  
Jumped bail and landed up in jail  
Life has often tried to stretch me  
But the rope always was slack  
And now that I've a pile  
I'll go down to the Chelsea  
I'll walk in on my feet  
But I'll leave there on my back  
  
Because I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
Oh the words that he spoke  
Seemed the wisest of philosophies  
There's nothing ever gained  
By a wet thing called a tear  
When the world is too dark  
And I need the light inside of me  
I'll walk into a bar  
And drink fifteen pints of beer  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

When I was a young man I carried my pack  
And I lived the free life of a rover  
From the murrays green basin to the dusty outback  
I waltzed my matilda all over  
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said son  
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be  
Done  
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun  
And they sent me away to the war  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As we sailed away from the quay  
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the  
Cheers  
We sailed off to Gallipoli  
  
How well I remember that terrible day  
When the blood stained the sand and the water  
And how in that hell that they called suvla bay  
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter  
Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well  
He showered us with bullets, he rained us with  
Shells  
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell  
Nearly blew us right back to Australia  
But the band played waltzing Matilda  
As we stopped to bury our slain  
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs  
Then it started all over again  
  
Now those who were living did their best to survive  
In that mad world of blood, death and fire  
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive  
While the corpses around me piled higher  
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit  
And when I woke up in my hospital bed  
And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was  
Dead  
Never knew there were worse things than dying  
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda  
To the green bushes so far and near  
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs  
No more waltzing Matilda for me  
  
So they collected the cripples, the wounded and  
Maimed  
And they shipped us back home to Australia  
The legless, the armless, the blind and insane  
Those proud wounded heroes of suvla  
And as our ship pulled into circular quay  
I looked at the place where me legs used to be  
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me  
To grieve and to mourn and to pity  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As they carried us down the gangway  
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared  
And they turned all their faces away  
  
And now every April I sit on my porch  
And I watch the parade pass before me  
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march  
Reliving the or their dreams of past glory  
i see the old men, all twisted and torn  
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war  
And the young people ask me, "what are they  
Marching for?"  
And I ask myself the same question  
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda  
And the old men still answer to the call  
But year after year their numbers get fewer  
Some day no one will march there at all  
  
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda  
Who'll go a-Waltzing Matilda with me?

The Cadillac stood by the house  
And the yanks they were within  
And the tinker boys they hissed advice  
'Hot-wire her with a pin'  
So we turned and shook as we had a look  
In the room where the dead men lay  
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip  
To the shores where his fathers laid  
  
But fifteen minutes later  
We had our first taste of whiskey  
There was uncles giving lectures  
On ancient Irish history  
The men all started telling jokes  
And the women they got frisky  
At five o'clock in the evening  
Every bastard there was piskey  
  
Fare thee well, gone away  
There's nothing left to say  
Farewell to New York City boys  
To Boston and PA  
He took them out  
With a well-aimed clout  
And I often heard to say  
I'm a free born man of the USA  
  
He fought the champ in Pittsburgh  
And he slashed him to the ground  
He took on Tiny Tartanella  
And it only went one round  
He never had no time for reds  
For drink or dice or whores  
But he never threw a fight  
When the fight was right  
So they sent him to the war  
  
Fare thee well  
There's nothing left to say  
With a slainte Joe and Erin go  
My love's in Amerikay  
The calling of the rosary  
Spanish wine from far away  
I'm a free born man of the USA  
  
This morning on the harbour  
When I said goodbye to you  
I remember how I swore  
That I'd come back to you one day  
And as the sunset came to meet  
The evening on the hill  
I told you I'd always love you  
I always did, I always will  
  
Fare thee well, gone away, there's nothing left to say  
Accept to say adieu  
To your eyes as blue  
As the water in the bay  
To big Jim Dwyer  
A man o'war who was often said to say  
I'm a free born man of the USA  
  
I'm a free born man of the USA  
I'm a free born man of the USA  
I'm a free born man of the USA

The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks  
There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks  
You sang me a song as pure as the breeze  
On a road leading up glenaveigh  
I sat for a while at the cross at finnoe  
Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom  
Heard the men coming home from the fair at shinrone  
Their hearts in tipperary wherever they go  
  
Take my hand, and dry your tears babe  
Take my hand, forget your fears babe  
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow  
They're all gone, gone in the years babe  
  
I sat for a while by the gap in the wall  
Found a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball  
Heard the cards being dealt, and the rosary called  
And a fiddle playing sean dun na ngall  
And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks  
There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks  
For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl  
About a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball  
  
So I walked as day was dawning  
Where small birds sang and leaves were falling  
Where we once watched the row boats landing  
By the broad majestic shannon

It's of a gentleman soldier  
As sentry he did stand  
He saluted a fair maiden  
By a waiving of his hand  
So then he boldly kissed her  
And he passed it off as a joke  
He drilled her up in the sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
All night they tossed and tumbled  
'Till the daylight did appear  
The soldier rose, put on his clothes,  
Saying, fare you well my dear  
For the drums they are a beating  
And the fifes they so sweetly play  
If it weren't for that polly my dear  
With you I'd gladly stay  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Now come you gentleman soldier,  
Won't you marry me?  
Oh no my dearest polly  
Such things can never be  
For I've a wife already  
Children i have three  
Two wives are allowed in the army  
But one's too many for me  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
If anyone comes a courting you,  
You can treat them to a glass  
If anyone comes a courting you,  
You can say you're a country lass  
You needn't ever tell them,  
Nor pass it off as a joke  
That you got drilled in a sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Oh it's come my gentleman soldier,  
Why didn't you tell me so? my parents will be angry  
When this they come to know when nine months had been and gone  
The poor girl she brought shame  
She had a little militia boy  
And she didn't know his name  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away

Farewell to you, my own true love,  
I am going far, far away  
I am bound for California,  
And I know that I'll return someday  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee  
I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship,  
Davy Crockett is her name,  
And her Captain's name was Burgess,  
And they say that she's a floating hell  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee  
Oh the sun is on the harbour, love,  
And I wish that I could remain,  
For I know that it will be a long, long time,  
Before I see you again  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee

Of all the money that e'er I spent  
I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that ever I did  
Alas, it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of wit  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
If I had money enough to spend  
And leisure to sit awhile  
There is a fair maid in the town  
That sorely has my heart beguiled  
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips  
I own she has my heart enthralled  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had  
They're sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had  
They'd wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  

McCormack and Richard Tauber are singing by the bed  
There's a glass of punch below your feet and an angel at your head  
There's devils on each side of you with bottles in their hands  
You need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign lands  
  
When you pissed yourself in Frankfurt and got syph down in cologne  
And you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all alone  
Frank Ryan brought you whiskey in a brothel in Madrid  
And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the yids  
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer  
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair  
  
And in the Euston tavern you screamed it was your shout  
But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out  
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains  
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again  
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer  
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair  
  
You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl  
There was lousy drunken bastards singing billy is in the bowl  
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch  
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church  
  
Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks  
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box  
Then they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the ground  
But you'll stick your head back out and shout "We'll have another round"  
At the graveside of Cuchulainn we'll kneel around and pray  
And god is in his heaven, and billy's down by the bay

Near Banbridge Town in the County Down  
One morning last July  
A boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair  
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself  
For to see I was really there  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head  
And I looked with a feelin' rare  
And I says, says I, to a passer-by  
"Whose the maid with the nut brown hair?"  
He smiled at me and he says's, says's he  
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown  
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann  
She's the star of the County Down"  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there  
I'll dress in my Sunday clothes  
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked  
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose  
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke  
Till my plough turns rust colored brown  
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside  
Sits the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  

Seen the carnival at Rome  
Had the women I had the booze  
All I can remember now  
Is little kids without no shoes  
  
So I saw that train  
And I got on it  
With a heartful of hate  
And a lust for vomit  
  
Now I'm walking on the sunnyside of the street  
Stepped over bodies in Bombay  
Tried to make it to the U.S.A.  
Ended up in Nepal  
  
Up on the roof with nothing at all  
And I knew that day  
I was going to stay  
Right where I am, on the sunnyside of the street  
  
Been in a palace, been in a jail  
I just don't want to be reborn a snail  
Just want to spend eternity  
Right where I am, on the sunnyside of the street  
  
As my mother wept it was then I swore  
To take my life as I would a whore  
I know I'm better than before  
I will not be reconstructed  
  
Just want to stay right here  
On the sunnyside of the street

The island it is silent now  
But the ghosts still haunt the waves  
And the torch lights up a famished man  
Who fortune could not save  
  
Did you work upon the railroad  
Did you rid the streets of crime  
Were your dollars from the white house  
Were they from the five and dime  
  
Did the old songs taunt or cheer you  
And did they still make you cry  
Did you count the months and years  
Or did your teardrops quickly dry  
  
Ah, no, says he, 'twas not to be  
On a coffin ship I came here  
And I never even got so far  
That they could change my name  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Across the western ocean  
To a land of opportunity  
That some of them will never see  
Fortune prevailing  
Across the western ocean  
Their bellies full  
Their spirits free  
They'll break the chains of poverty  
And they'll dance  
  
In Manhattan's desert twilight  
In the death of afternoon  
We stepped hand in hand on broadway  
Like the first man on the moon  
  
And "the blackbird" broke the silence  
As you whistled it so sweet  
And in Brendan Behan's footsteps  
I danced up and down the street  
  
Then we said goodnight to broadway  
Giving it our best regards  
Tipped our hats to mister Cohen  
Dear old times square's favorite bard  
  
Then we raised a glass to JFK  
And a dozen more besides  
When I got back to my empty room  
I suppose I must have cried  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Again across the ocean  
Where the hand of opportunity  
Draws tickets in a lottery  
Postcards we're mailing  
Of sky-blue skies and oceans  
From rooms the daylight never sees  
Where lights don't glow on Christmas trees  
But we dance to the music  
And we dance  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Across the western ocean  
Where the hand of opportunity  
Draws tickets in a lottery  
Where e'er we go, we celebrate  
The land that makes us refugees  
From fear of priests with empty plates  
From guilt and weeping effigies  
And we dance

In the rosy parks of England  
We'll sit and have a drink  
Of VP wine and cider 'til we can hardly think  
And we'll go where the spirits take us  
To heaven or to hell  
And kick up bloody murder in the town we love so well  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From the dear old streets of King's Cross  
To the doors of the ICA  
Going transmetropolitan  
We'll drink the rat's piss, kick the shite  
And I'm not going home tonight  
  
From Brixton's lovely boulevards  
To Hammersmith's sightly shores  
We'll scare the Camden Palace poofs  
And worry all the whores  
There's leechers up in Whitehall  
And queers in the GLC  
And when we've done those bastards in  
We'll storm the BBC  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Surrey Docks to Somers Town  
With a KMRIA  
Going transmetropolitan  
We'll drink the rat's piss, kick the shite  
And I'm not going home tonight  
  
From a 5 pound bet in William Hills  
To a Soho sex-shop dream  
From a fried egg in Valtaro's  
To a Tottenham Court Road ice cream  
We'll spew and lurch, get nicked and fixed  
On the way we'll kill and maim  
When you haven't got a penny, boys  
It's all the bloody same  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Pentonville Road on a sunset eve  
To the beauty that's Mill Lane  
Going transmetropolitan  
We'll drink the rat's piss, kick the shite  
And I'm not going home tonight  
  
This town has done us dirty  
This town has bled us dry  
We've been here for a long time  
And we'll be here 'til we die  
So we'll finish off the leavings  
Of blood and glue and beer  
And burn this bloody city down  
In the summer of the year  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Arlington House with a 2 bob bit  
To the Scottish shores today  
Going transmetropolitan  
We'll drink the rat's piss, kick the shite  
And I'm not going home tonight

Too many sad days  
Too many Tuesday mornings  
I thought of you today  
I wished it was yesterday morning  
I thought of you today  
And I dreamt you were dressed in mourning  
But I knew that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning  
I fell through the window  
And I found that I was still breathing  
I thought of tomorrow  
And the fear that you might leave me  
I thought of tomorrow  
And I wished it was Monday evening  
But I knew that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning  
Turn your face from me  
I will cover myself with sorrow  
Bring Hell down upon me  
I will surrender my heart to sorrow  
Bring Hell down upon me  
And I will say goodbye tomorrow  
But I know that you  
With your heart beating  
And your eyes shining  
Would be dreaming of me  
Lying with you  
On a Tuesday morning

I come old friend from Hell tonight  
Across the rotting sea  
Nor the nails of the cross  
Nor the blood of Christ  
Can bring you help this eve  
The dead have come to claim a debt from thee  
They stand outside your door  
Four score and three  
Did you keep a watch for the dead man's wind  
Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand  
Wailing away on the wall on the strand  
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned  
  
You remember when the ship went down  
You left me on the deck  
The captain's corpse jumped up  
And threw his arms around my neck  
For all these years I've had him on my back  
This debt cannot be paid with all your jack  
  
And as I sit and talk to you I see your face go white  
This shadow hanging over me  
Is no trick of the light  
The spectre on my back will soon be free  
The dead have come to claim a debt from thee

When I was young, I watched the cars  
When I was older, I drank in bars  
When I was young, well, I chewed the leaves  
When I was older, I drank with thieves  
I found a love, she gave me dreams  
She left me drunk in New Orleans  
So cold and lonely, so all alone  
I wished my heart was made of stone  
I took the cold bright needle  
I used it as a sword  
My eyes have seen the glory of  
The coming of the Lord  
I burned across the Delta  
I swam across the Ford  
My eyes have seen the glory of  
The coming of the Lord  
When I was a young man, standing on this road  
My empty belly, an aching hole  
An old man said to me, "Kid don't you know?"  
That it's the same wherever you go  
I gambled in two graveyards  
I won against the odds  
With the saints and with the saviors  
With the maggots and the Gods  
I cursed the things they showed me  
I could never see again  
And the howling of the wind at night  
I wrote upon the rain  
I found the thing for which I prayed  
And came back home to the USA  
With a heart of stone, so now I know  
That it's the same wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Come, come here we come  
Come, come here we come  
Come, come here we come  
...  

Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"Will ye go to the Waxies dargle?"  
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan,  
"I haven't got a farthing.  
I went up to Monto town  
To see Uncle McArdle  
But he wouldn't give me a half a crown  
For to go to the Waxies dargle."  
  
What will ya have?!  
I'll have a pint!  
I'll have a pint with you, Sir!  
And if one of ya' doesn't order soon  
We'll be chucked out of the boozer!  
  
Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"Will ye go to the Galway races?"  
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan,  
"I'll hawk me aul' man's braces.  
I went up to Capel Street  
To the Jewish moneylenders  
But he wouldn't give me a couple of bob  
For the aul' man's red suspenders."  
  
Chorus  
  
Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"We got no beef or mutton  
If we went up to Monto town  
We might get a drink for nuttin'"  
Here's a nice piece of advice  
I got from an aul' fishmonger:  
"When food is scarce and you see the hearse  
You'll know you have died of hunger."  
  
Chorus x2

Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop  
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'  
Like the stillness in the wind 'fore the hurricane begins  
The hour when the ship comes in  
Oh the seas will split and the ship will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking  
Then the tide will sound and the wind will pound  
And the morning will be breaking  
Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls they'll be smiling  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat that drifts on to the shore line  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
The foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
Jerk from their beds and think they're still dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin' we'll meet all your demands  
We'll shout from the bow your days are numbered  
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide  
And like Goliath they'll be conquered, yeah  

Sometimes I wonder who's makin' love to you now  
Now that it's been so long  
Yes, sometimes I wonder who's makin' love to you now  
Now that it's been so long  
Well, I don't know how or when you found out  
Where that love's been gone  
Remember that winter we went walkin' in the snow  
Now it's been and gone  
Yes, I remember that winter we went walkin' in the snow  
Snow that's been and gone  
And right across the country still I've got to go  
Wherever that love's been gone  
But any old way there's a smile on my face  
There's a smile that I just can't hide  
Though I'm missin' you now like I, like I never knew how  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
Don't it make you wonder but I wouldn't worry no more  
Standing by the side of the road  
Oh, don't it make you wonder but I wouldn't worry no more  
Just standing by the side of the road  
Into the night you just pick up and go  
You will see where that love's been gone  
But any old way there's a smile on my face  
There's a smile that I just couldn't hide  
Though I'm missing you now like I, like I never knew how  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  

As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains  
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting  
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier  
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver  
  
[Chorus]  
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da  
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o  
There's whiskey in the jar  
  
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny  
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder  
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water  
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell  
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier  
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling  
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling  
but I take delight in the juice of the barley  
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army  
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney  
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney  
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny  
  
[Chorus]

Now brave boys, we're on the march  
Off to Portugal and Spain  
Drums are beating, banners flying  
The Devil at home will come tonight  
  
So it's go, fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o, there's whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh, whiskey you're the devil, you're leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
You're sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh, whiskey you're my darling drunk or sober  
  
The French are fighting boldly  
Men are dying hot and coldly  
Give every man his flask of powder  
His firelock on his shoulder  
  
So its go, fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o, there's whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh, whiskey you're the devil, you're leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
You're sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh, whiskey you're my darling drunk or sober  
  
Says the old man, do not wrong me  
Don't take me daughter from me  
For if you do I will torment you  
When I'm dead my ghost will haunt you  
  
So its go, fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddie-o, there's whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh, whiskey you're the devil, you're leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
You're sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh, whiskey you're my darling drunk or sober  
  
Oh, whiskey you're the devil, you're leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
You're sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh, whiskey you're my darling drunk or sober

I loved you baby since we were at school  
I didn't show it, I was a fool  
You were burning I was cold as ice  
And baby now I realize  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
  
Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh  
Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh  
  
I gave you misery, I gave you lies  
And if I hurt you, I apologize  
I love your lips and I love your eyes  
I love your breasts, I love your thighs  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh  
  
Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh  
Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh  
  
Now all that I can do is hope and pray  
That you'll forgive me before it's too late  
There's only one thing I can say to you  
You know I love you, you know it's true  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Have you ever walked the lonesome hills  
And heard the curlews cry  
Or seen the raven black as night  
Upon a windswept sky  
To walk the purple heather  
And hear the westwind cry  
To know that's where the rapparee must die  
  
Since Cromwell pushed us westward  
To live our lowly lives  
There's some of us have deemed to fight  
From Tipperary mountains high  
Noble men with wills of iron  
Who are not afraid to die  
Who'll fight with Gaelic honour held on high  
  
A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell  
You who raped our Motherland  
I hope you're rotting down in hell  
For the horrors that you sent  
To our misfortunate forefathers  
Whom you robbed of their birthright  
"To hell or Connaught" may you burn in hell tonight  
  
Of one such man I'd like to speak  
A rapparee by name and deed  
His family dispossessed and slaughtered  
They put a price upon his head  
His name is known in song and story  
His deeds are legends still  
And murdered for blood money  
Was young Ned of the hill  
  
You have robbed our homes and fortunes  
Even drove us from our land  
You tried to break our spirit  
But you'll never understand  
The love of dear old Ireland  
That will forge an iron will  
As long as there are gallant men  
Like young Ned of the hill  
  
A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell  
You who raped our Motherland  
I hope you're rotting down in hell  
For the horrors that you sent  
To our misfortunate forefathers  
Whom you robbed of their birthright  
"To hell or Connaught" may you burn in hell tonight
