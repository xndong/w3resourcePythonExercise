Oh it's twelve o'clock  
On the old grey wall  
Yet another year  
'75 is here  
  
I hear all the people celebrating  
Another year  
Oh Darkness, darkness  
Inside my head  
  
I'm on my own again  
That's what I think I said  
This place is just a one-horse town  
So let the rain fall down  
  
Year and year again  
I'll be sitting here reflecting  
How nothing's changed  
But am I still the same  
  
People blow up all around me  
Yet I remain  
Nothing's changed  
Another day begins  
  
The same old same again  
It's like some movie scene  
I know it all frame by frame  
I'll try to figure out what it means  
  
Some other day  
Now my diary  
Is looking back at me  
Oh it's another year  
  
'76 is here  
I'm watching all the people celebrating  
Another year  
It's another year  
  
Another year  
Another year

(T. Clarke)  
  
He was working for the airline one day  
And out on the street the next  
The company always came first with him  
She came second best  
His life was aviation  
He was rising fast  
They let him go  
He became  
A victim of the past  
She lost her job the same month  
At "Fashions For You"  
She lost her chance of ever seeing Paris  
Lost the baby too  
They took all their belongings  
And managed to get a loan  
And put it all into this broken down building  
That called itself a restaurant  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
And now she is just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
Must have lost his touch  
Maybe he's out to lunch  
His life was aviation  
He was rising fast  
But who needs expert in fuel conservation  
When the planes are out of gas  
He still reads "Aviation"  
When he has the time  
And if he gets to talk to God he's gonna  
Give him a piece of his mind, yeah  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
Now she's just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
He must have lost his touch  
Maybe he's out for lunch  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
Now she is just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
Maybe he's not to blame  
Maybe he's changed his name

I'm thinking of taking  
The easy way out  
Open the window  
I'll fall to the ground  
I could do it -- wouldn't be much too it  
I gotta little place here in the city  
It's kind of small and dirty, it's a bedsitter  
And there's a lot of us living here  
Wall to wall in one big house  
And when the night comes 'round  
I can see a lot of lonely lights  
There are people in there breathing  
But it don't seem right  
In the streets way down below me  
I'm listening for just a sound  
But nobody comes around  
In bedsitter land  
And there's a man below me on the balcony  
Crying to be heard  
Screaming to be heard  
I'm haunted by his words  
And the people in the street just shrug their shoulders  
Saying he's disturbed  
He's in another world  
Screaming at the birds  
Crying to be heard  
I hear his every word  
I've slept in the gutter on a summer's day  
Oh I've bummed cigarettes in the night cafes  
I've joined the breadline  
Believe I got a deadline  
I gotta little place here in the city  
It's kind of small and dirty, it's a bedsitter  
And there's a lot of us living here  
Wall to wall in one big house  
And when the night comes 'round  
I can see a lot of lonely lights  
There are people in there breathing  
But it don't seem right  
In the streets way down below me  
I'm listening for just a sound  
But nobody comes around  
The lights are going down  
Nobody comes around  
In bedsitterland

Standin' beside of the ocea-ean, lookin' out across the water  
Everything is beautiful, but I still don't feel like I oughta  
Things we wante-ed, not so long ago  
I got 'em all now babe, but I ain't got you no more-ore  
  
Still I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
I remember everythi-ing, the dresses you used to wear-ear  
You were so light and graceful, you seemed to float right through the air-air  
And me, I looked so funny dancing but you loved me anyhow  
Now I wish I could find somebody to love me like that now  
  
But I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
Standin' beside of the ocean, lookin' out across the bay  
I should look for companionship but it just gets in my way-ay  
All the lights are flickering, out along the shore  
And I see people dancin' there but I just don't dance no more  
  
Oh I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
Let me see you dance, let me see you da-a-ance  
Ohhhh baby let me see you da-ance  
I can still see you da-ance, I remember you dancin'  
Ohhhh baby let me see you dance  
Come on let me see you dance  
Let me see you, let me see you, da-ance, da-ance, da-ance  

Well, she talks in her sleep  
About the men that she meets  
With so much passion  
In the morning i ask  
But she takes me to task  
Says i'm overreacting  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her, she looks at me like i'm strange  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no  
  
Well, she sits on the phone  
Like she's here on her own  
Making these calls to no one  
Now she slides out a ten  
Says she's seeing a friend  
She's got so much going on  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her  
She looks at me like i'm strange  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no  
  
Well, i follow her down to some part of town  
Where we've never been before  
There's a car in the drive, and a man sits inside  
I gotta stop her, before she gets in  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her  
She looks at me like i'm insane  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no

They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be  
They say we'll fall  
Like others will fall  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You know you'll break my heart  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You'll see me fall apart  
Don't tell that it's over  
Or else I, well I might fall apart  
Now, when we first met  
I was just a poor boy on the street  
And you looked at me and took me in  
Yeah, and knocked me off my feet  
Now you don't really want to break things up  
The things we've been through, boy they're enough  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Don't say that it's over  
You know you'll break my heart  
Don't tell me that it's over  
You'll see me fall apart  
Don't tell that it's over  
Or else I, well I might fall apart  
They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be

You hold my life in your hands  
You build me as if I were a king  
Your heart does not understand  
I give you my everything  
Oh the night that started with wine  
Is ending just like it was a dream  
I held her glove in my hand  
I gave her my everything  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back  
I held the cards in my hand  
They fooled me just a pack of lies  
It seems they wrecked all my plans  
  
God knows how I really tried  
Oh that night that started with wine  
It's ending just like it was a dream  
I hold her glove in my hand  
I gave her my everything  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back

It's easy to love when I love someone like you  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do  
You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast  
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last  
On the day that I met you I knew it could be  
So easy for you and so easy for me  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do, babe  
Like the stars in the night seem to shine from above  
But that's the way that you shine when you give me your love  
And your love satisfies me like a natural high  
From the sole of my feet to the top of the sky  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do  
You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast  
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last  
On the day that I met you I knew it could be  
So easy for you and so easy for me  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
Oh and I do, babe  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do, babe  
Oh and I do, babe  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
It's easy to love  
It's easy to love

Keep me steady  
Don't rock me all around  
Lord, I don't wanna fall down  
Understand me  
I wish this jet was off the ground  
Look around you  
And tell me what you see  
Are you afraid or is it me?  
I hope we make it  
I hope we don't fall in the sea  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
Make me happy  
Just let me see the light  
I hope the runaway path is near  
The look the captain gave  
Was it confidence or fear  
Oh, was it fear  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight

Oo, but love was just so hard to find  
Until you came along into my life  
Then I thought I would lose my mind  
When you said that you wanted to be mine  
And ever since that day I've been hooked  
And nothin' could turn me away  
This livin' with you's like a dream come true  
And it grows more and more every day  
  
Oo, I'm reachin' the highest of highs  
Every time I look in your eyes  
Ask how I feel I can say it out loud  
I feel like a million inside  
I never thought this could happen to me  
You got me just where you want me baby  
For your love I would do anything  
Every night I'm a fool for your love yeah  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Hey I'm just a fool for your love  
  
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town  
When my day's work is all through  
The sun and the lights  
Well I wish I could fly just to get back faster to you  
I waited all day by the telephone  
Starin' at the clock on the wall  
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms  
And I just can't wait to hold you  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Hey I'm just a fool for your love  
  
Oo, you're givin' me chills up my spine  
I'm feelin' so fine goin' out of my mind  
Then and I don't care if it never stops  
I'll love you right up until I drop  
  
You know I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love

On every corner of every avenue  
The word's been passed all around  
Better watch out, lock up your daughters  
'Cause that bad Frankie lee is back in town  
All the ladies fall for Frankie  
Sayin', Frankie Lee, how can it be  
Of all the men here, you're the only one  
Who's got the key, to set us free  
Oh, Frankie Lee  
Now there's a woman, in this neighborhood  
Who's loving Frankie in her mind  
But in fear of bein' discovered  
She keeps her secret locked up inside  
Just then a stone's thrown up at the window  
And she looks below, what does she see  
There's a man there, standing 'neath the streetlight  
It looks to be  
Like Frankie Lee  
You'd best believe  
Well, old Frankie steals through the back door  
While her old man is leavin' by the hall  
But before she hears his footsteps  
Frankie's standing at the bedroom door  
So she holds him, then she begs him  
Oh Frankie Lee, don't 'cha ever leave  
And he tells her, she's the only one  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set her free  
Then as the moon fades, into the night sky  
Frankie leaves while she's asleep  
Then he's up and out on the street again  
He's got the key that'll set you free  
That Frankie Lee  
Every kid in this ol' gang town  
They'd want to be like Frankie Lee  
Please the ladies, like a vagabond  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set them free  
Yeah, every kid in this ol' gang town  
Yeah, they'd want to be like Frankie Lee  
Casanova and Valentino  
They'd like to be as good as Frankie lee  
Every kid in this ol' gang town  
They'd like to be like Frankie Lee  
Please the ladies, like a vagabond  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set them free

Ghosts  
People that I left behind  
Wandering lonely in the night  
All in my memories  
  
Dreams  
Long forgotten flights of time  
Flashbacks flooding through my mind  
Of all the things you said to me  
  
In the shadows where I walk  
In the silence the wind talks of you  
Just like a ghost haunting the night  
So you wander through my life  
  
Ghosts  
People that I don't believe  
Just what they've got to do with me  
Oh, I can't see it, no, no  
  
Ghosts  
Long forgotten in time  
Look at these flashbacks flooding through my mind  
Of all the things you've said to me  
In the shadows where I walk  
In the silence the wind talks of you  
Just like a ghost haunting the night  
You know you wander through my life

I paid all my dues  
So I picked up my shoes  
I got up and walked away  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
I didn't know how to play  
I've worked hard and failed  
Now all I can say is  
I threw it all away  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Sail away, sail away  
Ooh, well I know better now,  
I know better now  
Giving it all away  
Oh oh, I now better now,  
I know better now  
I've given it all away  
Went out in the world  
Too much for my nerves  
Well, only myself to blame  
See, I was just a boy  
And there was nobody else to blame  
I've done all I can  
Now it's out of my hands  
Stand on my head and say  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Sail away, yeah sail away  
Oh, I know better now,  
I know better now  
Ain't gonna give it all away  
Oh oh, yeah yeah, I now better now,  
I know better now  
Ain't gonna give it all away  
Ooh, I know better now  
I know better now  
I've given it all away  
See I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Oh, I know better now  
Giving it all away  
I was just a boy

Farewell old friend  
Leave me now be gone  
My soul is weak  
My mind is never strong  
Watch my hands at night  
And see the way they're shaking  
See the endless road  
See the way it's taking  
And it's still the same old night  
And it still just don't seem right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Writing down my life  
On endless scraps of paper  
Years of hanging round  
A life of wasted labor  
And it's still the same old night  
And somehow it don't feel right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Goodnight old friend  
I'll see you once again  
The dawn will come  
And haunt me once again  
Watch my life unfold  
And see the shape it's taking  
Watch my fingers write  
And see the way they're shaking  
And it's still the same old night  
And somehow it don't feel right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Goodnight old friend  
I'll see you once again  
The dawn will come  
And haunt us once again  
And it's still the same old night  
And it's still the same old night  
And it's still the same old night  
Ah, it's still the same old night

We giving up on all the emptiness  
I fill it up with your sweet love beside me.  
Ain't no fun to be a rolling stone inside  
You buy the feeling and you pay with tears.  
For what it matters you flow with the motion  
Then out of nowhere there's a full moon rising  
And it's mine.  
And every  
Every moment is the history we make - and more  
We got a legacy of understanding  
I can love you better  
But donY let your -  
Heart stop beating in time  
Don't take me below the danger level.  
Caught up in the middle of a misery -  
Don't let me die.  
And I warn you if you let your  
Heart stop beating in time  
Don't make it a fatal combination  
I won't ever find another your love no more.  
Got to get closer  
Got to be in sight  
You make it heaven to breathe with you woman.  
Don't you get lonely in the midnight hour like me?  
And there's an angel that I follow on the wind - and more  
Within a universe of undiscovered eyes  
We found each other  
So don't let your -  
Heart stop beating  
In time  
Don't take me below the danger level.  
Caught up in the middle of a misery.  
Oh baby  
Don't let it be.  
Save my soul  
I don't want to be no chains that hold  
Gotta be a wild new world out.  
There is a plan  
I don't want to be no one night stand  
Gonna be alive for you down.  
Here is the love I can hold out in my hand  
And you can feel it I'm nothing if you let your -  
Heart stop beating in time  
. . .  
Don't let your heart stop beating in time  
. .

I live in the times  
That you left behind  
I sold 'em my mind for nickels and dimes  
I must have been blind  
  
I search for the cause  
That has no reward  
I've tried to move on  
But everyone's gone on and I  
  
Can't get it back  
No, I can't get it back  
I'm always reaching for the right track  
Where has it gone why can't I get it back  
  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no-one to hold on to  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've nothing to hold onto  
Lost in a daze  
I'll never erase  
  
When radio waves  
Would take us away  
On dreams that we've made  
Like an old song  
  
I just don't belong  
But I try to be strong  
So let the music roll on  
We can't get it back  
  
Yes, I can't get it back  
I'm always listening for the right track  
And when it's gone I want to play it back  
Where have my heroes gone  
  
I've no-one left to hold on to  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
Where have my heroes gone  
  
I've no one left to hold on to, oh  
(Don't let those heroes die  
Their songs have changed our lives  
They came they saw  
  
They conquered all  
Don't let them die  
And say goodbye  
Am I always searching for the right track  
  
Where have they have gone  
Why can't I get it back  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no-one left to hold on to  
  
I'm out here standing on a landslide  
I'm out here falling through a paper sky  
Where have my heroes gone  
I've no one left to hold on to  
They're gone  
  
(Don't let those heroes die  
Their songs have changed our lives  
They came they saw  
They conquered all  
Don't let them die  
And say goodbye)

How much love, do you need  
Before you give your love to me  
How much time, before it grows  
How much love I want to know  
  
What can I do  
What can I say  
The last thing I want  
Is to drive you away  
How much love, does it take  
How much love for heaven sake  
  
How much love, how much love  
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate  
How much love

How much love  
How much love  
How much love  
How much love  
  
Give me some kind of clue  
There must be a way to get through to you  
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate  
Do I rush right in or do I wait  
  
How much love  
How much love  
  
Can't help myself  
  
How much love  
How much love  
  
Gotta let me in baby

So you're leaving in the morning  
On the early train  
I could say everything?s alright  
I could pretend and say goodbye  
Got your ticket, got your suitcase  
Got your leaving smile  
I could say that's the way it goes  
I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  
Took a taxi to the station  
Not a word was said  
I saw you walk across the road  
Maybe the last time, I don't know  
Feeling humble, I heard a rumble  
On the railway track  
And when I hear the whistle blow  
I walk away and you don't know that I was lying  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  
?Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  

Listening to the falling rain  
Always seems to bring her back again  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
Sound of her voice, her look upon her face  
Like children playing children's games  
We joked and laughed at every passing day  
I'm so much older, things have changed  
I've realized that now it's just too late  
  
I hear the laughter echoin' through my brain  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
I tried to forget her heaven knows  
Seems there's no direction left to go  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
  
I'm alone again, alone again  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could turn this all around  
It's just my foolish fantasy  
But that won't bring your sweet love back to me  
  
I hear the laughter, somebody called my name  
I hear the laughter and I can feel the pain  
I hear the laughter echoing through my brain  
I hear the laughter then I'm alone again  
I hear the laughter, I hear the laughter

We were just two kids in high school  
Who'd never been in love before  
Just happened to be together  
We never wanted more  
We had one long crazy summer  
Life was like a honeymoon  
But we couldn't hold back our feelin's  
Guess you came along too soon  
  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
  
I was workin' my way through college  
When you wrote and told me the news  
Said you were gonna have a baby  
Yeah, I knew my college days were through  
Had to work late to make the money  
You saw more of the kid than me  
I guess I knew I failed you when  
You said that you'd rather be free  
You wanted to be free  
  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
  
Well I heard you got away to Florida  
Got a husband, took the kid  
I bet they think the whole world of you  
Just like I always did  
You were the only one I ever wanted  
But I know you can't be replaced  
If only we'd met a little later, babe  
We wouldn't of made the same mistakes  
  
Oh, no, no, no, ooh  
Darlin', yeah  
I think we fell in love too fast  
I know it now  
Ooh, darlin', darlin'  
I know we fell in love too fast, too fast  
Ooh, darlin', yeah  
I think we fell in love too fast  
I know it now  
Ooh, darlin', darlin'  
I know we fell in love too fast, too fast

You know I thought I could live without you  
I thought I could get along  
But I never realized that I could be so wrong  
Was I a fool to leave you  
Or was I a fool to let you go  
Doesn't seem to matter much now baby  
I should have never let you go  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I will never stop until I got you back  
I wander the road where we used to walk  
And lots of people pass by  
They all look like they're in love  
Everybody but me  
I see your face in the crowd  
I hear your voice everywhere I go  
And when I turn around thinking you've come back  
Ah, you're never, never, never there  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I'll keep on searchin' until you're really here  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I'll never stop until I get you back  
Back in my arms to stay[Solo]  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I will never stop until I know I've got  
You back in my heart to stay

Seen a lot of good times in my life  
Times when everything went so right  
Seen a lot of things go wrong and I just don't know why  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
Had a bit of sadness in my life  
Friend of mine went down the other night  
Tried to sort it out but now I just don't know why  
I've had a bit of sadness in my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
I've taken lots of chances in my life  
Now one of them has changed me overnight  
I've seen a glimpse of the other side  
The lights are much too bright  
I've taken lots of chances in my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put these things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
I gotta do something with my life  
Gotta make a change and put up a fight  
Stand on my own two feet and do it right  
I gotta do something with my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life

Standing by the railway station  
Waiting for your train  
But the train never comes  
No, the train never comes  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes I think I'm going out of my head  
  
Running down the track  
Trying to reach the end  
But the end never comes  
No, the end never comes  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes I think I'm going out of my head  
  
I've been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time rolls by before my eyes  
That's the story of my life  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Aaah - aaah  
Aaah  
Aaah  
  
I've been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time goes by before my eyes  
That's the story of my life  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Well I Think I'm going out of my  
  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my head

Last night I realized  
There's no point in compromise  
I guess it's time we said it's over  
'cause I been watchin' you  
Searchin' for something' new  
Go find it now 'cause it's all over  
What's the sense in bitterness  
It only leads to emptiness  
I thought that we'd find happiness  
But we've run out of track and we won't get it back  
'cause it's over, it's all over  
It's all over, it's over  
I'm gonna have to live with this  
The one thing that I will miss  
Is coming to you when my day is over  
I'll come home to loneliness  
My life all in a mess  
Just wishing we were never over  
You read about it every day  
Another love has gone astray  
But who would think we'd end this way  
We've run out of track and we won't get it back  
And it's over, it's all over  
It's over, it's all over  
I remember when you said to me  
Take care when you share your love  
Before you give it all so easily  
Be sure that you can give enough  
Look what happened to us  
It's all over, it's over  
Over, it's all over  
It's all over, it's all over  
We've run out of track and we won't get back  
'cause it's over  
No more me, no more you  
It's over  
It's all over

Don't look back, that'll get you nowhere  
A wall to wall suit and space circus hair  
One step forward, one step back  
That's what happens and that's a fact  
  
To tell the truth, you raise up your hand  
Don't write me no invitations in the sand  
And when you talk, say what you mean  
Just keep it dry, lord, and keep it clean  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
  
I don't know why and I can't explain  
Why I'm lost on a street with no name  
But that's alright, that's okay  
I just feel like I'm slipping away  
Satellite mama, if you are near  
Hey, the party's over, now just get me outa here  
Silent night, watch over me  
See that nobody writes me into the dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm on fire, inside my head  
Someone put out the light  
And they sent the world to bed  
It's not too late, but I just can't stop  
I think this time I'm going over the top  
Hey, Mr. Dogface, please let me in  
Say, don't you think that I'm worth rememberin'  
Watch your step, watch what you do  
Cause you need me much more than I need you  
  
[Chorus]

Little girl have your funtake it easyjust don't jump the gunyou don't have to
try so hardyou will always be my number oneyou got me in your bed of
rosesplease don't change the boy'cause havin' you around heaven knowsis

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om  
Let it be  
And in my hour of dar-arkness  
She's standing right in front of me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om, let it be  
  
Let it be, oh let it be-ee  
Whisper wor-ords of wisdom  
Oh let it be  
  
When the night is cloudy  
There's still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow-ow  
Let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om  
Just let it be  
  
Let it be-ee, oh let it be-ee  
And there will be an answer  
Just let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Livin' in the world agree  
There'll now be an answer  
Oh God let it be  
Though they may be parted  
There's a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer-er  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be-ee, oh let it be-ee  
Whisper words of wisdo-om  
Ah let it be  
  
Let it be (let it be, let it be)  
There will be an answer  
Just let it be  
  
(Let it be-ee, let it be-ee-ee-ee)  
There will be an answer-er  
Just le-et it be

You... you are my reason to live  
You make me shine... with all the love that you give  
And when I think of you... I keep driftin' away  
Little by little... I love you more ever day  
I lay in bed but I just can't sleep  
I close my eyes and you're all that I see  
I can't believe that it's happening to me  
  
Living in a fantasy  
Ever since you came to me  
Living in a fantasy  
Drowning in this luxury  
Ever since you came to me  
I'm living in a dream  
  
Oh, I know... there'll be storms up ahead  
We'll blow them away... bring back the sun again  
For love conquers all... the gloom and despair  
Nothin' can go wrong... just as long as you're there  
I see a light on the path up ahead  
I know you'll wait on the cliff where you said  
I'll hold you close 'till we're right on the edge  
  
Living in a fantasy  
Oh you're too much... too soon... too strong  
But I want to drown in your touch  
Don't keep me floating too long

I was travellin' down the road  
Feelin' hungry and cold  
I saw a sign down the road sayin'  
Food and drinks for everyone  
So naturally I thought  
I would take me a look inside  
I saw so much food  
There was water coming from my eyes  
  
Yeah there was ham and there was turkey  
There was caviar  
And long tall glasses  
With wine up to why'are  
And somebody grabbed me  
Threw me out on my chair  
Said before you can eat  
You gotta dance like Fred Astaire  
  
You know I can't dance you know I can't dance  
You know I can't dance you know I can't dance  
I can't dance  
  
I am a man of the road  
A hobo by name  
I don't seek entertainment  
Just poultry and game  
But if it's all the same to you  
Then yes I will try my hand  
If you were hungry as me  
Then I'm sure you will understand  
  
Now wait a minute  
  
Of course I can dance  
Of course I can dance  
I'm sure I can dance  
I'm sure I can dance  
I can dance  
I really hit the floor  
Ah it feels good  
Look at me dancing  
  
I did a two-step quick-step and a bossa nova  
A little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino  
You should have seen me moving  
Right across the floor  
Hand me down my tuxedo  
Next week I'm coming back for more  
  
I can dance  
Oh yes I can dance  
Look at me dance on the floor moving  
I feel good  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance

Well everybody knows down Ladbrook grove  
You have to leap across the street  
You can lose your life under a taxi cab  
You gotta have eyes in your feet  
  
You find a nice soft corner and you sit right down  
Take up your guitar and play  
But then the law man comes says move along  
So you move along all day  
  
Well I'm a one man band  
Nobody knows nor understands  
Is there anybody out there want to lend me a hand  
With my one man band  
  
For three days now I haven't eaten at all  
My my you must be getting so thin  
And soon my cap won't be large enough  
To drop a half a crown in  
  
So hey there mister don't you look so sad  
Don't look so ill at ease  
Well I can play you any song you like  
To cheer up that life you lead  
  
Well I'm a one man band  
Nobody knows nor understands  
Is there anybody out there want to lend me a hand  
With my one man band  
  
And oh oh oh look at the rain falling  
Oh oh oh look at it rain  
Oh look at it rain  
  
Well nobody sees the minstrel boy as he sings his tale of woe  
Nobody sees him coming  
Nobody see him go  
So hey there mister don't you look so sad  
Don't look so ill at ease  
Well I can play you any song you like  
To cheer up that life you lead  
  
Well I'm a one man band  
Nobody knows nor understands  
Is there anybody out there want to lend me a hand  
With my one man band  
  
Well I'm a one man band  
Nobody knows nor understands  
Is there anybody out there want to lend me a hand  
With my one man band  
  
Oh I'm a one man band  
Just a one man band  
Oh I'm a one man band

Oh when the night creeps  
Up over the hillside  
Oh it's so quiet up here  
You can hear your thoughts from the inside  
Oh well it took me a while  
To take in the atmosphere  
Dark clouds of evil all around  
  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
  
There is no hooded killer  
No dracula  
No frankenstein  
Oh well it's all psychological  
Oh it's all in your mind  
  
Oh when a boy  
We'd visit a haunted house  
And there were demons inside  
Of that there isn't a doubt  
And I would hide behind my hand every night  
With fear right there on my brow  
  
Oh I see danger in living  
I'm on a runaway train without wheels  
Now I'm crawling through a tunnel  
With bloodhounds at my heels  
Everywhere I turn there are screams all around  
Behind trees wolves howl

To tell the truth it's really such a sad affair  
Standing here waiting in the cold night air  
But I've got to make this call  
Cause my heart is breaking.  
  
I hear the bips drop a coin in the slot  
Has it been that long  
I thought you'd forgotten me  
Well I know that it's getting late  
But I just couldn't wait  
  
Will I have the nerve to say  
I just wanna come back  
You shouldn't just go away  
I just wanna come back  
  
Ive been struck by such a bad luck  
I need a place a little happiness and some love  
I think I can see it now  
Now let me paint the picture  
  
Its twelve o'clock and the curtains are drawn  
They're counting sheep down in orchard road  
You're hanging on the telephone line tonight  
And I wish I could be in orchard road  
  
Not much been happening here  
I think Ive got a job  
They're gonna call me next week  
And I'll be working out of town  
But it sure beats hanging around  
  
What's that? Tomorrow at two  
You're kidding me, no  
Is it alright with you  
I don't know what to say  
It'll be like a holiday  
  
When you say you're all alone  
Makes me wanna come back  
And this house is not a home  
I just gotta go back  
  
Its twelve ten when I put down the phone  
The moons shining down on orchard road  
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight  
Ill see you in my dreams of orchard road  
  
Its funny but I thought I'd never go back  
I think sometimes I might loose track  
But I remember you and the things we do  
And I want it back.  
  
In orchard road you've got my heart  
I left it in your doorway  
In orchard road a welcome back  
Is waiting there just for me  
In orchard road the sun will shine  
Again I know I know  
In orchard road you keep my love  
Just waiting there for me  
  
Its eight o'clock and the dawns arrived  
In orchard road it's breakfast time  
I climb in my car and I turn the key and I'm gone  
I am coming home  
To orchard road  
  
I'm coming home

I feel so lost and lonely  
Standing by the river Seine  
I don't know how I got here or why I came  
But everywhere I see her smiling face  
I remember  
We met somewhere in the back streets  
In this city of another age  
And talking broken English 'til the darkness came  
And in my room she called me by my name  
And she whispered  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
It disappears in the sunshine  
It's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
It's always gonna be that way  
When we made love in that hotel  
Like I never made before  
Thought I could die  
When she whispered slow  
Marai toujours  
She was wild and enchanting  
The night was like a dream  
We danced and sang the  
Sweetest harmony  
The words come back so clear  
I remember when we sang  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
[Solo]  
When I awoke in the morning  
She was nowhere to be found  
That's why I'm standing  
Waiting a t this river's edge  
I know we'll never meet again  
It was true when she said  
Paris dies in the morning  
(It ends this way)  
The moment when it steals your heart  
And then it loves you  
Paris dies I the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no no  
She disappeared in the morning light  
She said that it would end this way  
Did not believe her  
Paris dies in the morning light  
I know we'll never meet again  
[Solo]  
I know we'll never meet again  
She's gone  
Paris dies in the morning

The sun is out, the sky is blue  
There's not a cloud to spoil the view  
But it's raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
The weatherman says fine today  
He doesn't know that you've gone away  
And it's raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
Aww, aww misery, aww misery  
Aww what's gonna become of me oh woe  
I tell myself, my blues won't show but I know  
That soon all my tears will flow come a  
Raining down, raining in my heart  
  
Aww oh aww misery, oh you misery  
Aww, what's gonna become of me woah  
  
The sun is out, the sky is blue  
There's not a cloud to spoil the view  
But it's raining, oh it's raining in my heart

Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt, ooh, that you have caused  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Time after time I see reflections of you and me  
  
Reflections of  
The way life used to be  
Reflections of  
The love you took from me  
  
I'm all alone now, no love to shield me  
Back to the world of that stops at reality  
Oh that happiness, ah you took from me  
And you left me with only memories  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Through all these tears I'm cryin'  
Reflects the hurt I can't control  
  
'cause though you're gone  
I keep holdin' on  
Through the happy times  
When you were mine  
  
As I peer through the window of lost time  
Thinkin' over my yesterdays  
All the love I had in vain  
All the love I have wasted  
All the tears I have tasted, uh-huh  
  
Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt, ooh, you have caused  
Ev'rywhere I turn, ev'rything I see  
Reflects the love that used to be  
  
In you I put all my love  
My faith and trust  
And right before my eyes  
My world has turned to dust  
At drop of night I sat alone and wept  
Just a handful of promises'  
All that's left of lovin' you -- whoo  
  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
The way I used to be  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection

)  
I heard some things about you  
I can't believe it's true  
I heard the flame don't burn bright as it used to  
I heard some things about you  
I know they must be lies  
Don't turn your face away, baby  
When I need to see your eyes  
''cause I keep hearing rumors  
People telling me rumors  
I keep hearing those rumors  
Seems like everybody's my best friend  
Rumors, don't go believing rumors  
I swear it's only rumors  
Listen babe, I don't want our love to end  
(It's a shame - they talk, they talk, they talk)  
I heard some things about you  
Suspicion coming on  
I need some answers woman  
Don't tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong  
I heard some things about you  
The way you're treating me  
You give your love to someone else  
When it used to come to me  
Oh I've been hearing rumors  
Everybody's saying rumors  
I don't want to hear no rumors  
How come everybody wants to be my best friend  
I don't believe it no, oh  
(It's a shame - they talk  
They talk, they talk  
They talk, they talk  
They talk, they talk:)  
Now I've got so many friends  
I've never had before  
And you're the only friend I want  
I don't want no more  
All these rumors I hear  
I can't believe they're true  
And they're trying to tear me  
Oh no, they're trying to tear me away from you  
Rumors, I don't believe it babe  
Rumors  
They're just whispers in the wind  
They've got it all wrong  
Everybody's wants our love to end  
Rumors, I don't believe in those  
Rumors, lots of big rumors  
Rumors, it's only vicious rumors  
I don't want our love to end  
I don't want our love to end  
I don't want our love to end

Papers lie there helplessly  
In a pile outside the door  
I tried and tried, but I just can't remember  
What they're for  
The world outside is tugging  
Like a beggar at my sleep  
Ah, that's much too old  
A story to believe  
And you know  
That it's taken it's share of me  
Even though  
You take such good care of me  
Now, you say Morocco  
And that makes me smile  
I haven't seen Morocco  
For a long, long while  
The dreams are rolling down  
Across the places in my mind  
And I've just had  
A taste of something fine  
The future hides and the past just slides  
England lies between  
Floating in a silver mist  
So cold and so clean  
And California's shaking  
Like some angry child will  
Who has asked for love  
And isn't answered still  
And you know  
That I'm looking back carefully  
'Cause I know  
That there's still something there for me  
But you said Morocco  
And it made me smile  
And it hasn't been that easy  
For a long, long while  
And looking back into your eyes  
I saw them really shine  
Giving me a taste  
Of something fine, something fine  
Now, if you see Morocco  
I know you'll go in style  
I may not see Morocco  
For a little while  
But while you're there  
I was hoping you might keep it in your mind  
To save me just a taste  
Of something fine  

Sometimes you can be like a stranger  
In moments when you're so far away  
In the night when i reach out to hold you  
You just turn away, why do you turn away  
  
Oh, i love you so when you're smilin'  
But your smile has faded overnight  
Will we stay like this for a lifetime  
Gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right  
  
Why do we always have stormy weather  
Why do we have it so rough  
Is it so hard just to stay close together  
Why can't we ever have love  
  
Oh, i knew from the first time i saw you  
I just had to make you mine  
Felt so sad when you told me  
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life  
  
So here we are just a few years further  
Still tryin' to make it work  
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl  
Is just a little love, oh baby, just a little love  
  
Why should we always have stormy weather  
Why should we have it so rough  
It's not so hard just to stay close together  
Why can't we only have love

You contend  
That you'll never got back to her again  
You're as free as a night without end  
So you tell your friends  
  
Just what you had to endure  
When you told her never, never again  
And as the room about you starts to bend  
You pretend  
  
That you've taken the easy way out  
Though you know ehn you told her last night  
You were fakin' the easy way out  
With one hand reachin' fo the door  
  
But your feet weren't movin'  
They were nailed to the floor  
As she told you once more  
There's no easy way to get out  
  
She's not like you  
She'd rather stay at home  
'n' not get the blues  
And if you ever do try to intrude  
  
She's so respectfully rude  
So it was hard to believe  
Last night while you were drunk 'n'  
Threatening to leave  
  
That she walked through the door with such ease  
'n' threw you the key  
And she's takin' the easy way out  
And you're alone with no number to call  
  
She's taken the easy way out  
With one hand reachin' for the door  
And you so speechless  
Marooned on the floor  
  
She walked out of your life  
Couldn't stand it no more  
Now you're all on your own  
'Cause she's taken the easy way out  
  
You know she's taken the easy way out  
Oh, but your pride will only admit to a lie  
Yeah, she's taken the easy way out  
But, to your friends  
  
You're the hero of the night  
Drowning with beef all the tears in your eyes  
Hopin' it don't show that you're dyin' inside  
'Cause you can't quite believe  
  
That she's taken the easy way out  
There's no goin' back now  
Stuck here on your own  
Lookin' for a home  
  
Drunk and on the streets  
Stuck on your feet

Jeanette was a dancer  
I suppose I knew her well  
Her feet danced miracles  
I was lost within her spell  
  
Jeanette knew a singer  
Was the leader of some band  
Looked just like a boy  
And stood just like a man  
  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Yes it rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
  
The kids in the back street cry  
You hear their voices in your brain  
The world is full of hungry souls  
Behind the window panes  
  
Little Jenny on the high wire  
Slow motion as she fell  
Sometimes I think the wire is me  
The tragedy as well  
  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Oh yes it rains all down the avenue  
It rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
  
I work on the west side  
Jeanette I pulled your strings  
I stood upon the pavement  
I never owned a thing  
And still I am the singer  
I know my song so well  
  
The rain falls through my eyes  
And lands below the shell  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Yes it rains all down the avenue  
Oh yes it rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you

He says he doesn't care  
To the girl with the painted hair  
And staggers through the angry crowd  
Like it isn't there  
Feels like a wall of sound  
As he crashes down  
No-one stops to look  
When he hits the ground  
  
We're the nouveaux rich  
On a one way tip  
Living out on a razor's edge  
Just to get our kicks  
We're gonna take a stand  
Til the world is in our hands  
And if we win or lose  
We don't give a damn  
  
Hollow people living empty lives  
Looking vacant in the neon lights  
Who need the truth when you can live a lie  
Can't stop now it's too late  
  
Cause we're running blind  
Til the end, comes like a thunder  
Yeah, and we all fall under  
No-one gives a damn  
Come on now, let's meet the end  
  
He tries to make it home  
Head like a block of stone  
His eyes so closed up now  
His arm so full of dope  
  
There's nowhere left to run  
He cries out but no, one comes  
In the back of some dark alley  
He dies alone  
  
Hollow people living empty lives  
Hearts feel nothing in the neon lights  
Feelings here are so cheap these days  
  
No-one really cares  
If we lose of if we win  
Yeah, were the angry youth  
Yeah, don't want to be like you  
  
Yeah, we do what we want  
Til we want to die  
Yeah, we're the nouveaux rich  
Yeah, we gotcha in our grip  
There's no escape for you  
  
Cause we're running blind  
We're so angry  
We're just so angry  
Angry  
We're all so angry  
In the end

Though he heard her clearly  
She said it so sincerely  
That's something that he doesn't understand  
Her words were choked and broken  
She left him with a token  
The note he is holding in his hand  
(Don't let me down, don't let me down)  
Is this the end of the game  
And will you put out the flame  
And fly away  
Don't fly away  
Now let's find out who's too blame  
And start all over again  
Don't fly away  
Don't fly away  
Way across the city  
Waiting on a taxi  
Holding cases  
Standing in the hall  
Thinking "well if only"  
She's feeling sad and lonely  
Hoping 'gainst all hope that he will call  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Is this the end of the game  
And should I put out the flame  
And fly away, and fly away  
And if I walk out again  
Is it true that the pain  
Will fly away, fly away  
Fly away  
The taxi driver's talking  
But she doesn't hear a single word he says  
Fly away,  
The tears fall so easily  
Keep falling 'til she climbs aboard the plane  
And it's the end of the game  
With only fortune to blame  
  
[Solo]  
  
Yes, it's the end of the game  
But love was given in vain  
Sail away, sail away  
Just like the sunshine and rain  
It's true that one day will pain will fly away  
Fly away, fly away  

Southdown motor co  
2a bus  
You can see right inside  
My parent's house  
Sitting at the table and my dinner's up  
It's gonna be different when  
The kid's grown up  
Gonna save some money  
And quit this job  
Light the way  
Clear the stage  
The kid's grown up  
Used to play in the underground  
Hyde park  
Now I'm riding in a limousine  
Through the underpass  
I'm sitting in an aeroplane  
It's all such a rush  
People all around me making  
So much fuss  
And I've got a little money  
But it ain't gonna burn me up  
If I'm in your town  
Tonight I am -- watch out  
The kid's grown up

Though the world has changed  
We're still the same  
You know that I love you - yeah  
Though the world has changed  
  
We're still the same  
You know that I love you - yeah, yeah  
Counting the months and the years  
When I lived alone  
  
The days were so bleak  
And the nights were so black and cold  
Walkin' around in the street  
In the pouring rain  
  
Hanging 'round waitin' for love  
But it never came  
Suddenly you were there  
Though I never thought about you  
  
Now that the world has changed  
It's so strange how I found you  
Sharing a secret that no one  
Could understand  
  
Feeling brave in my heart  
Yet too scared to let go of your hand  
Runnin' wild in the streets  
Just the way all the young lovers do  
  
You only livin' for me  
And me only for you  
Suddenly life had changed  
When you said I love you  
  
And though the words were plain  
It's so strange  
You said I love you  
And oh how my life has changed  
  
After searchin' in vain  
I found you  
  
Though the world has changed  
We're still the same - I still love you  
Though the world has changed  
Aah, we're still the same, why'know I love you  
  
One night I thought that you were gone  
What could I do?  
Runnin' around in the pouring rain  
Lookin' for you  
  
Wondering if I'd ever see you again  
Then through the darkness  
I heard you calling my name  
Loving you when you're not there  
  
I'm never lonely anywhere  
Outside the world has changed  
We're the same  
I still love you  
  
And though the world has changed  
The words are the same  
You know I love you

You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
You know there isn't anyone  
Anyone who loves me like you  
Holdin' you close and feelin' your heart beat inside  
It's just like a miracle  
And you're makin' me feel so glad I'm alive  
And in every way I'm gonna thank you  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I couldn't be  
You know there isn't anyone  
Anyone to keep you from me  
If you're caught in a storm or lost out at sea  
Searchin' for that miracle  
I would soften the wind  
And calm the angry sea  
To bring you home to me  
So if they built up an army  
To take you from me  
Just like a miracle  
I would fly like an eagle  
And carry you so far away in my fantasy  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
Oh no, no, oh  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
Oh no, no, oh

Standing here alone with you  
Wondering what it is that I'm supposed to do  
And there you are with the love light in your eye  
The bridges are burnt down  
Your arms are open wide  
Am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore  
Is this the real thing?  
  
I don't know but I've never been here before  
And I feel a thunder in my heart that I can't control  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Should I walk away or follow my soul?  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Where it comes from I just don't know  
  
Oh no, oh no  
  
There's a storm ragin' deep in my soul  
There's a howlin' wind that I just can't control  
There'sa fire inside me I can't explain  
Every time you touch me my love falls like rain  
I've only known you for an hour or more  
The time is standin' still  
Your love has opened up the door  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
It takes my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Will I ever be the same?  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
It's telling me you're here to stay  
  
Oh no, oh no  
  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
  
Take me baby I'm all yours  
Do just what you wanna do with my love  
Let's not let the night overtake us  
'Cause what's happening right now may make or break us  
Do you feel the way I do?  
Open up your heart now baby  
I'm comin' through  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin' my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you I'll never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know you're here to stay  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin' my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you I'll never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know you're here to stay  

Though you don't call anymore  
I sit and wait in vain  
I guess I'll rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I want to tell you baby  
Changes I've been going through  
Missing you, listen you  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Why did you have to decide  
You had to set me free  
I'm gonna swallow my pride  
I'm gonna beg you to please  
Baby won't you please see me  
I'm gonna walk by myself  
To prove that my love is true  
Oh, for you baby  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Living for you my dear  
Is like living in a world of constant fear  
Hear my plea, I've got to make you see  
That our love is dying  
Our love is dying  
It's dying  
Although your phone you ignore  
Somehow I must explain  
I'm gonna rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I'm gonna camp on your step  
Until I get through to you  
I've got to change your view baby  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Yeah 'til you come back to me  
That's what I'll do  
'Til you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do

I could love you but you're hard to touch  
Standing by you I have seen so much  
Ain't it funny how I found the one  
But you pull back to protect a heart born to run  
Passion begs you to oblige them all  
Love escapes you and you watch them fall  
Giving nothing you are left to bleed  
Will you ever recognize I know what you need  
  
I want to hold you tight  
Give you the rest of my life  
You are my heaven  
The river flows to the sea  
Like you could reach out to me  
But I can get in  
Till you let your heart win  
  
Dressed in silence  
To disguise the pain  
Pure emotion doesn't know your name  
Love still haunts you  
Please don't turn away  
I'm with you if you care  
Oh you know, things will change  
  
Cause I want to hold you tight  
And give you the rest of my life  
You are my heaven  
The river flows to the sea  
Like you could reach out to me  
But love can get in  
Till you let your heart win  
(You let your heart win)  
Till let your heart win  
  
Oh let it win  
Let your heart win baby  
Please give in  
Let your heart win baby  
Try and give in, try and give in  
Let your heart  
Let your heart win

When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
It's only a heartbeat away  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hands and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
The telephone can't take the place of your smile  
But you know I won't be travelin' forever  
It's cold out but hold out and do I like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you babe  
It's only a heartbeat away  
  
It's not easy when the road is your driver  
Honey that's a heavy load that we bear  
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do  
  
Oh, I need you  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hands and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
When I need you  
Just close my eyes  
And you're right here by my side  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
I just hold out my hands  
I just hold out my hand  
And I'm with you darlin'  
Yes, I'm with you darlin'  
All I want to give you  
It's only a heartbeat away  
  
Oh I need you darling

Please, tell me what's on your mind  
I can see the tears but I don't know why  
You're crying  
It it me or is it you  
  
Is it real or just a mood  
Well I know you're sad but what are you  
Tryin' to prove  
When you say that you can't go on  
  
And you feel like you don't belong  
You've got nobody to lean upon  
It seems we've come so far but we just can't  
Get along  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go wrong  
  
I've been workin' -- never coming home at all  
I left you chained to the kitchen busy walkin'  
Up the wall  
Now I don't want nobody else  
  
And I'm not thinking about myself  
When I say that I'll do anything to stop you  
Saying that you don't belong  
And what we had is just upped and gone  
  
Please please try -- try to be strong  
Oh I apologize -- I didn't mean to lead you on  
Where did we go wrong  
Well you know there ain't nobody else  
  
I'd be a fool trying to please myself  
If I thought that there could be anybody else  
Well you'll see now as time goes on  
I'll be the one that you can lean upon  
  
We'll dry out the tears and never have to say  
That we were wrong  
Ooh babe we'll get it on

Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling  
Falling so deep in love with you  
But you say that  
Only a fool could fall in love  
With a girl like you  
If that's the truth  
What have I got to lose?  
And I wonder who, I wonder who  
  
Who will the next fool be  
Will it be me?  
I wonder who  
Can you tell me please  
Who will the next fool be  
Could it be me?  
  
Lonely, I'm so lonely  
Maybe, maybe you're lonely to  
So don't spend your time  
Just sitting around  
Wondering who will he be  
  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me  
I'm the one you need  
Can you tell me please?  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me, I don't mind  
  
Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling  
Falling, what can I do  
Thinking a girl like you  
Could fall for a fool like me  
  
Who will the next fool be  
Could it be me?  
  
Can you tell me please  
When you make up your mind  
Who will the next fool be?  
Let it be me

Sun's up, mm, hmm, looks okay  
The world survives into another day  
And I'm thinking about eternity  
And this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Yeah, I had another dream about lions at the door  
They weren't half as frightening as they were before  
I'm thinking about eternity  
Some kind of ecstasy's got a hold on me  
Walls windows trees, waves coming through  
You'll be into me and I'll be into you  
Together in eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Big orange flying boat rises off the lake  
Thousand-year-old dinosaur doing a double take  
Pointing a finger at eternity  
I'm sitting here in the middle of this ecstasy  
Last night again there where lions at the door  
But I wasn't frightened like I was before  
Thinking about eternity  
And the ecstasy that's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
I'm wonderin'  
  
[Solo]  
  
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay  
One of these days we're going to sail away  
Sail into eternity  
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me  
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Wonderin' where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where they are  
I wanna know  
Where the lions are

I'm tryin' to buy a piece of heaven  
But I'll be gone before that heaven comes  
  
Work, work, work  
Who needs it  
It's all I ever seem to do  
I'm killin' myself for a livin'  
  
Livin' the working man's blues  
Minute to minute  
Day after day  
Wherever I go it's always the same  
  
I work a little longer  
And make up my pay  
But when the cheque comes along  
They've taken half of it away  
  
All this work, work, work, work  
Who needs it  
All, all I ever seem to do  
Why'know I'm killin' myself for a livin'  
  
I should be stayin' at home with you  
City to city  
All over the world  
Wherever I've been to  
  
That's all I ever heard  
You work a little longer  
To double up on that pay  
Then the tax man comes along  
  
They've taken half of it away  
Work, work, work  
Who needs it  
It's all I ever seem to do  
  
I'm killin', killin', killin' time for a livin'  
Livin' the working man's blues  
Yeah, work, work, work  
Oh, my  
  
That's all it is  
Killin' myself for a livin'  
Like drivin' a nail straight into my hand  
I've been working my life away  
  
That's right  
Working my life away  
I'm working my life  
All this work, work, work,  
  
Working my life away  
Working my life away  
You know sometimes I get home in the evenin'  
And lay in bed at night just dreamin'  
  
I had enough a whole pay cheque sittin' in my hand  
So we can split it between the two of us  
And buy that big mansion on the hill  
Where that rich guy lives  
  
Who says he pays me every week  
Oh, I don't want to work no more  
I can't stand it

I am the voice  
I am the radio  
You hear me loud and clear  
Across the open sky  
  
Into the night  
You hear me loud and clear  
I was thinking you're a part of my mind  
Breathing sleeping talking two of a kind  
  
I'm the voice in your head  
(do you read me)  
The word you just said  
(do you hear me)  
  
Aah - the world goes spinning around  
Aah - and you all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
I feel the pain  
I feel the joy and love  
You hear it loud and clear  
But should the music stop  
  
I'll feel so low  
I'll fade and disappear  
I'm just thinking that we're two of a kind  
Think I know what's going on in your mind  
  
When the red light goes on  
(can you tell me)  
Is your green light still on  
(do your hear me)  
  
Aah - the world goes spinning around  
Aah - and you all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
The world goes spinning around  
Aah - we all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
We join in with the sound  
The world goes spinning, spinning around  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
Radio  
Is the green light on  
(can you tell me)  
Don't put your red light on  
(do you read me)  
I know the green light's on  
Don't put, don't put your red light on  
Is the green light on

I don't need you to mend my broken heart  
Not afraid you can throw your sticks and stones  
But this love is tearing me apart  
I've got a wounded heart  
  
And it won't stop beating  
Tried to keep it a casual affair  
Nonetheless we get careless ''cause we care  
Why does love make me fall apart  
  
It only hurts my heart  
And it won't stop beating  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
  
No matter what I do  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
  
Missing you  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
  
A wounded heart  
Do you need me like I need you  
You know I'm tryin'  
To get some piece of mind  
  
But I can't seem to put  
The past behind  
I don't want you  
Living in my dreams  
  
No matter how it seems  
I don't want you  
I gotta wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
  
No matter what I do  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
  
Missing you  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
  
A wounded heart  
You need me like I need you  
  
Oh you know I'm missing you, ooh  
I gotta wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
No matter what I do  
  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
I'm missing you, missing you  
  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
A wounded heart  
  
Keeps repeating  
I'm missing you

You've got a cute way of talking  
You got the better of me  
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking  
Like a dog hanging on your lead  
I'm in a spin you know  
Shaking on string you know  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
Quarter to four in the morning  
I ain't feeling tired no no no no no  
Just hold me tight and leave on the light  
Cause I don't want to go home  
You put a spell on me  
I'm right where you want me to be  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I want to dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing  
  
You take me higher  
I'm gonna catch on fire 'cause  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I'm gonna dance my life away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
You really slipped me a potion  
I can't get off of the floor  
All this perpetual motion  
You gotta give me some more  
You gotta give me some more  
And if you'll let me stay we'll dance our lives away  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
I feel  
You make me feel like dancing  

You win, I lose  
That's how it all begins  
Well I try so hard in these affairs of the heart  
But I know that I'll never win  
  
Well I talk to you sweet like honey  
Don't I treat you as nice as pie  
But I can't figure out when you scream and you shout  
Why I have to apologize  
  
You win, I lose  
That's how it always goes  
I came into this thing with my heart in a spin  
I went out with a broken nose  
  
You win, I lose  
That's how it's meant to be  
Well I tried all I can just to figure it out  
But love's just mystery  
  
Guess all you ladies would call me easy  
But I'm a fool for the femme fatale  
When she flashes those eyes I'm not a man I'm a mouse  
Tryin' to patch up a broken heart  
  
You win, I lose  
That's okay that's the way it goes  
Well I tried all I could but it did me no good  
'Cause all I've got is nothin' to show  
  
They say that men are always supposed to act  
Like they're not really tryin'  
But when I come on cool nobody seems to notice  
It's a mystery  
It's a mystery to me  
  
You see you win, I lose  
I guess that's how we're meant to be  
I tried as hard as I could but it did me no good  
You're more than a match for me  
And it don't make no sense to me  
Love is still a mystery  
It's just a mystery

Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
This flame that burns  
Within my heart will never die  
Oh I bless the day you come along  
You turned my life into a song  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
Brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
I find each day I love you more  
Always the one I'm waiting for  
No matter where I go  
No matter what I do  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
Still brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
You bring me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Now I never knew  
What life was all about, yeah  
Then you came along  
And gave me a reason to understand what it's about, oh darling  
  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
'Cause you're the only one  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
It brings me to my knees  
(Your love has given me)  
Still brings me to my knees  
(Your love still brings me to my knees)  
You've given me everything  
Given me everything, darling
