I know that we're gonna be together, you and me  
For more than a rhyme or two, your time belongs to me  
Rowing back down my river, chasing my tail to the sea  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be me  
Watching your crazy ways and all the lazy days  
Digging you more and more the more I see your face  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be free  
Rowing back down my river, chasing my tail to the sea  
Watching the simple things to help me grow along  
Loving the note she bring to help me sing my song  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be me  
Rowing back down my river, singing my songs to the sea  
I know that we're gonna be together, you and me  
For more than a time or two, your rhymes belongs to me

Although I've been away so many lonely nights  
You know I'm back today, I'm back to stay in your arms  
Although I've been around and lived the life I said I loved  
You know without you honey, all I do is worth nothing  
And girlie, don't cry for me  
Although there might be other people in my life  
Honey, on my mind, you will always find there's only you  
And though you say you'll journey to some foreign land  
I'll remember you, yes, and I'll be true to your memory  
And when at last you do come wandering home to me  
I might look at you but it will be through the weeks between  
And when I hold you it might not be you I have  
In the passing days, we might both have changed to something new

Now woman, don't you feel sad when you see your life go round  
And you realise you've been drinking all of your years like wine?  
You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win  
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying  
And woman, it's your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say  
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found

Time after time, I held it just to watch it die  
Line after line, I loved it just to watch it cry  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you home  
Wave after wave, I washed it just to watch it turn  
Day after day, I cooled it just to watch it burn  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you home  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Pain after pain, I stood it just to see how it feels  
Rain after rain, I stood it just to make it real  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the day you go away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Time after time, I held it just to watch it die  
Line after line, I loved it just to watch it cry  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  

Call me baby, make sure I'm home.  
  
I did not hear that call last night  
I didn't hear that call you might have made.  
  
Everytime you go away, I think you've gone away to stay  
And I sit down  
And I commit myself to a deepest despair  
Everytime you move around, I think about moving  
Running away, making running repairs.  
  
Everytime you run around, I think about another time  
I think about moving  
But then again just where  
Everytime I go away, I think you've gone away to stay  
I think about it, and I cry baby, cry baby, I cry baby.  
  
Because if you don't call me, then I can't call you  
If you don't call me, then I can't call you, don't know the number  
If you don't call me, then I can't call you  
If you don't call me, tell me, what can I do.  
  
Cause if you took a little time to think  
You'd know, I know you'd know  
I will always be there by your right hand  
And if you took a little time to think about it  
You'd know  
That I will always be there, will always try to understand.  
  
Don't call me, can't call you  
If you don't call me, I can't call you, I haven't got the number  
Call me baby, or I can't call you  
Tell me love of my life, what can I do.  
  
Everytime you go away, I feel you've gone away to stay  
I sit on down and feel so scared baby, scared baby, scared baby  
Everytime you run around, I think about another town  
I think about moving, making some running repairs.  
  
But if you don't call me, then I can't call you  
If you don't call me, what am I going to do, darling  
If you don't call me, I can't call you, don't have the number  
You know that I can't call.  
  
Any time you care to call my name, I will be waiting  
Any time you care to call my name, I'll be there, baby  
Baby baby, when you call I might be sitting by the phone  
I might be on the bedside.  
  
Any time you care to make a call, make sure I'm in  
Make sure I'm home, make sure I'm home  
Any time you care to use that telephone ring  
Let that telephone ring, let it ring down  
Let it ring down, like bells from heaven  
Let that telephone ring, let it make that call.  
  
Let that telephone ring, make sure I'm at home  
Make sure I'm home when that telephone rings.  
Cos if you don't call, I'll do the same to you, baby as you do to me  
I won't call you, you won't know my number  
I've had enough of this, darling don't call or I won't call you.  
  
  

  
Never gonna give it up never gonnna it up never never  
  
I could have given you everything you need  
I cannot turn back the years  
A perfect love was what you wanted from me  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
It's important to be strong, carry on  
You've got to go forward no matter what they think  
When you find your heart in pieces one thing you can do  
And it's love deep down  
Got a love deep down  
  
It's too bad I love you  
It's too bad for me  
It's too bad I love you  
It's too bad for me  
  
Sometimes it hits me in the morning  
Sometimes it hits me in the middle of the day  
Turn back the covers and I throw back the light  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
It's important to be strong, carry one  
You've got to be full no matter what they think  
When you find yourself in pieces only one thing to do  
Let loose deep down, love deep down  
  
It's too bad I loved you  
It's too bad for me  
It's too bad I loved you  
Too bad for me  
  
I could have given you everything you needed  
But I cannot turn back the years  
A perfect love was what you wanted from me  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
Never gonna give it up never gonnna it up never never  
Oh no never gonna give it up

If you kissed the sun right out of the sky for me  
And if you told me all the lies that I deserve  
And if you laid all night in the rain for me  
  
Well, I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
I couldn't love you more  
  
And if you loved me till my eyes gave no more shine for you  
If you walked beside me all the long way home  
And if you wasted all of your time on me  
  
Well, I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
  
And if you gave me all the things, I'd never ask of you  
And if you showed me all the ways you have to cry  
And if you laid all night in the rain for me  
  
I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby  
It just don't matter anyhow  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out of your windown, I'll be gone  
You're the reason that I'm travelling on  
Don't think twice it's alright  
It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl  
Like you never done before  
It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl  
I just can't hear you any more  
I wish there was something you might do or say  
To make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice it's alright  
It ain't no use you turning on your light, babe  
The light that I never knowed  
It ain't no use you turning on your light, baby  
'Cause I'm on the dark side of the road  
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind  
You could have done better, I just don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice it's alright  
I'm walking down my long lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
'Goodbye' is too good a word, baby  
So I'll just say ''Fare thee well''  
I'm thinking and I'm wondering all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul  
Don't think twice  
Don't think twice  
Don't think twice it's alright

And I don't want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I don't want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love.  
  
Sometimes it gets so hard to listen  
Hard for me to use my eyes  
And all around the cold is glistening  
Making sure it keeps me down to size.  
  
And I don't want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I don't want to know one thing about evil  
Only want to know about love.  
  
I'm waiting for the planes to tumble  
Waiting for the towns to fall  
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble  
Waiting till I see you crawl.  
  
Yes it's getting hard to listen  
Hard for us to use our eyes  
Cause all around that gold is glistening  
Making sure it keeps us hypnotized.  
  
And I don't want to know about evil  
I only want to know about love  
I don't want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love.  
  
I don't want to know anything about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I don't want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love.

If I can't be a happy man, I won't be no one at all  
If I can't be just who I am, I won't let you come to  
call  
I was all right before I walked through the door  
I was all right outside, but inside I had to cry.  
  
Low today and high tomorrow, I see that it's real  
One man's meat's another man's sorrow, do you know how  
it feels  
To be dead drunk on the floor  
To get up and ask for more?  
To be lying in the dark crying.  
  
If I can't be a peaceful man, I will be who I can  
If I can't get everything I want, I'll just get what I  
can  
I was alright before I walked out the door  
I was alright inside  
  
But outside I had to look again, again, again  
  
A love  
Love again  
A love supreme, divine  
Anyway that you want it to be  
Love Its love, its love  
Love! Love! Love!  
A love supreme, a love supreme  
A love supreme, a love supreme  
  
Make no mistake,  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
  
Divine it's love, it's fine, its wine, its time, its  
love  
Love! Love! Love  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
  
Make no mistake, its love  
It's love It's love love

One day without you  
And I feel just like I'm somebody else  
One day without you  
And there's a fear there might be somebody else  
You know, I'd like to keep you  
Keep you to myself and by my side  
You know, I'd like to keep you  
Just like I know it's wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings is born to fly  
One day without you  
And I feel just like some lost ship at sea  
One day without you  
And every friend I meet seems strange  
You know that I'd like to keep you  
Keep you to myself and by my side  
You know I'd like to keep you  
Just like I know it's wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings is born to fly  
One day without you  
I feel a hole just where my heart should be  
One day without you  
And I feel just how sad my life could be  
You know I'd like to keep you  
Keep you to myself, keep by my side  
You know I'd like to keep you  
Just like I know it's wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings deserves to fly  

No difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
No difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
  
If by some chance you say goodbye to me  
Rest assured, you'll always be loved  
Better loved you never could be  
And if, by some chance, I say goodbye to you  
Call my bluff, I'm never that tough  
That's a thing I never could do  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this heart of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
  
Feel no difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
No difference here  
  
But if some tiny crack should ever start to show  
Never you fear, I will always be here  
First man to let you know  
If some tiny difference should rear its head and shine  
Don't you care, I'll be there  
First man to call you mine  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this heart of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love of my life  
  
One love in my life is enough for me

One love of my life

Oh Sandy Grey, are you going away?  
Leave me a message before parting  
Time has changed you and the things that pain you  
Are the things you think of as you're starting  
Oh Sandy Grey, it's only this I'll pray  
That you might stay here one more day in laughter  
Won't you hang around and hold me, repeat all the lies you told me?  
Do your rambling after  
Oh Sandy Grey, what ever made you want to stay?  
And now what makes you want to be a-leaving?  
Is it the same thing they found when they laid your father down  
Or are your reasons even worth retrieving?  
Oh Sandy Grey, don't leave me just today  
Don't think on the road you'll be a-going  
Think of all the time and the days we've had to mind  
Of the future there's no way of knowing  
Oh Sandy Grey, I thought I heard you say  
That you ain't heard one word that I've been speaking  
There's no use in trying you escaping from my mind  
And I'll never see the world you're seeking

I watch the day go down  
Sapphire  
I watch my luck turn round  
A high flyer  
I threw my bones around  
Sure fire  
I watch the current run  
Live wire  
Clear blue  
Too true  
Clear blue  
Too true.  
  
I don't know what to do  
I got no place to go  
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire  
My precious gems are dust  
There's nothing left to trust  
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire.  
  
I saw her running round  
Sweet liar.  
And I ran the garden path  
Sweet briar  
I did just what I could  
So tired  
I threw my keys away  
With no desire  
Clear blue  
Too true.  
  
I don't know what to do  
I got no place to go  
Oh the days I miss sweet Sapphire  
My precious gems are dust  
There's nothing left to trust  
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire.  
  
I got no place to go  
I don't know what to do  
Ooh, the dream about Sapphire  
I don't know what to do  
I got nowhere to go  
I got no face to show without Sapphire.  
  
My precious gems are dust  
There's nothing left to trust  
oh since the day I lost my sweet Sapphire  
There's nothing I can trust  
My precious gems are dust  
Oh, the day I lost sweet Sapphire.  
  
I don't know what to do  
I don't know where to go  
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire.

You've been taking your time and you've been living on solid air  
You've been walking the line and you've been living on solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round inside  
And I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air  
  
You've been painting the blues and you've been looking through solid air  
You've been seeing it through and you've been looking through solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
And I can tell you don't like what you find when you're moving through solid
air  
  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend, I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
  
You've been stoning it cold, you've been living on solid air  
You've been finding it cold, you've been living on solid air  
I don't know what's going on inside  
I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air  
  
You've been getting too deep, you've been living on solid air  
You've been missing your sleep and you've been moving through solid air  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But I know you don't like what you find when you're moving through solid air  
  
You've been walking your line, you've been walking on solid air  
You've been taking your time but you've been walking on solid air  
Don't know what's going on inside  
But I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air

It's only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They can't stand to see you  
Being who you are.  
  
It's only small town talk  
Don't pay it no mind  
Don't believe a word they say  
They do it to you every time.  
  
You can't believe everything you hear  
Only half of what you might see  
But if you have to believe in anyone  
I'd believe, darling, believe in me.  
  
It's only small town talk  
A well-known fact  
You don't even know  
How one other might react  
To what you're thinking  
What are they thinking.  
  
It's only small town talk  
They're telling all the lies  
And make some people crazy  
They don't realize we're still thinking.  
  
We're only people, trying to live together  
We're trying to make this little life work  
Who are we to judge one another  
It may lead to tears or maybe something even worse.  
  
It's only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They can't stand to see you  
Being just exactly who you are.  
  
It's small town talk  
Pittle, pattle, it's small town talk  
Tittle, tattle, it's small town talk.

May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
You're just like a great and strong brother of mine  
And you know that I love you true  
You never talk dirty behind my back  
And I know that there's those that do  
  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind  
Love is a lesson to learn in our time  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me

You hold no blade to stab me in my back  
And I know that there's those that do  
  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind  
Love is a lesson to learn in our time  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me  
  
May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
Well you're just like a great and strong brother of mine  
And you know that I love you like I should  
You never talk about me behind my back  
And I know that there's time you could  
  
Please won't you please, please bear it in mind  
Life is a lesson to learn in our time  
Won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me  
  
May you never lose your temper  
If you get hit in a bar room fight  
May you never lose your woman over night  
  
May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
Please won't you please, please won't you bear it in mind  
Life is a lesson to learn in our time  
Won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me

This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover  
As valiant a man as ever left home  
And he had been much reduced  
Which caused great confusion  
And that was the reason he started to roam  
In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble  
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest  
By the foot of yon' mountain  
Lays a clear flowing fountain  
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh  
With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted  
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make  
But he dreamt about sighing  
Lamenting and crying  
Go home to your family and rambling forsake  
'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember  
When first he arrived home to his family and friends  
And they did stand so astounded  
Surprised and dumbfounded  
To see such a stranger once more in their sight  
And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories  
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away  
And he's as happy as those  
As have thousands of riches  
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away  
This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover  
As valiant a man as ever left home  
And he had been much reduced  
And caused great confusion  
And that was the reason he started to roam

She walked to the water  
And came back looking good and feeling fine  
And you could tell by her eyes  
She was not wasting time  
  
She walked to the water  
And every light went on inside the town  
You know the love in her eyes  
Was flashing on the rocks all around  
  
Down to the water she walked  
And all the people moved aside  
You know the light in her hair so bright  
They almost cried  
  
Saved by the water  
She said and she was right, I know she was  
You know she told me true  
About all the things I got  
  
Going down to see her  
Bring yourself and all that you might own  
She can give you the clues  
To all the seeds you've sown  
  
Down to the water  
She came back feeling fine and looking good  
And you could tell by her eyes  
That she always knew she would

On this June morning, I give you warning  
I might just fly away across the dawn  
I looked into my lover's eyes, there I saw the sunrise  
There I saw the birth of something new  
And suddenly I'm not the same little boy  
'Cause I can't see the people that I meet  
All I see is her  
Since the time she went away I just exist from day to day  
I can't live, I can't love without her near  
Sitting here in my darkened room, whistling through the velvet gloom  
Wondering what the hell I'm doing here  
For suddenly I'm not the same little boy  
And I can't see the people that I meet  
All I see is her  
There's just me and my conscience now, there's no one to tell me why or how  
I fell away, it's time I must return  
We might recover what has been, turn all the pieces round again  
Change and rearrange, begin again
