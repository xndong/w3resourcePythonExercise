Red light (ohh), red light (ohh, ohh)

[Chorus] - 2X  
Smoke by myself  
Drink by myself  
Poke these hoes by my goddamn self, for rrreal (By my goddamn self)  
For rrreal (By my goddamn self)  
[Verse 1]  
Nigga dwell on it, can't he  
So tell on me, got my bitch all at the crib  
Try to smell on a nigga, want to stay around him  
But when I'm sitting on the couch  
She keep me saying "ouch", 'cause she grabbin on my crouch  
And I already know, thinking to myself  
What the fuck, somebody told  
Had to have been one little nigga that I showed  
Some shit that they never should have seen, anyhow  
All hell nigguh...hatin' on me now, smokin' on my weed  
Steady drinkin' on my beer, hell naw niggah  
Get the fuck up out of here, can't hold one  
So you can't hold your tongue, nigga lips smackin  
Like she chew bubble gum, tell her where I been  
What I did, who I'm with  
Said see me with two bitches, that's when I said it  
I gotta stay the fuck away from head, I'ma  
[Chorus] - 2X  
[Verse 2]  
Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself  
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fuss with nobody else  
Now red light, child started a fight  
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright  
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovas  
Shorty, did I stutter? Go get another rubba  
Child is shaking like blubba, child that want me to cut her  
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out!  
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work  
I'm hitting the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky  
Haven't seen what I've been, I'm drinking all alone  
On the phone with my b...l, you, n, t 'course every day  
I white out, acamo, philly, or marsailles  
Give a fuck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?  
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club  
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' 'cause I...  
[Chorus] - 2X  
[Verse 3]  
Smoke by myself, drink byself  
Poke by myself, cause I was born by my God damn self  
Fuck, run and train, that shit lame  
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain  
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high  
I don't give a fuck, if ya got fire  
Every now and then you chip, and you want to get Henn  
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin, don't roll trees  
Hey man, shit, take it from me  
You better off to get drunk on a Pepsi  
Up, that's a beep, might be a freak (Hey lemme roll with your phone?)  
I ain't taking nobody with me, I'ma ride by myself  
Get high by myself, get drunk by myself  
Fuck this ho by my goddamn self (myself)  
Don't nobody hold your own, like your own  
that's why we on our own...  
[Chorus] - 3X  
[Outro]  
See now when you do what you do, how you do what you do  
When you do what you do, nobody can tell on you  
If you all by yourself, ah ah ah, say it  
I don't need no friends, I don't need no foes  
I'ma drink my Henn, and choke all out the door  
Now everybody said goodbye, get your hand that burns  
It's just good to see ya ride, reverse, reverse  
Biieetch, reverse, reverse, biieetch  
To wonder all this time, what happened this time? (Hoooo!)  
Everybody tries ta, everybody chill...we just playin'  
Everybody but me, Ying Yang Twins out for the 2001  
(Eh, we'd like to thank y'all)  
Went down to the jukebox...

Ok yeah A-t-l-a-n-t-a Atlanta niggas

In the motha fuckin' city  
  
[Chorus]  
You got a one way ticket to hell,  
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,  
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,  
All my niggaz say,  
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5
and 6, but that's it.  
  
For a nigga with a dream,  
Atlanta is the city,  
And they make it so seem,  
But ride through the city,  
And The Streets ain't clean,  
All I see is drug deals, big wheels and feinds,  
But any way they took East Atlanta back,(?)  
Throw Atlanta Down,  
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town,  
And fo, I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK,  
I ain't talkin' about the dope,  
In talking about the raggedy road,  
Niggas crack they rims riding over potholes,  
But that's how it goes,  
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghetto's.  
  
[Chorus]  
You got a one way ticket to hell,  
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,  
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,  
All my niggaz say,  
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5
and 6, but that's it.  
  
They talking ATL, Atlanta Georgia,  
We the shit,  
We talking Holy Feild you know that nigga named Michael Vick  
They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,  
They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,  
Charles is gone, Cher is show case,  
5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),  
Back then Shawty D was gone,  
Flat heat right here was on,  
They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game  
Atlanta just won't be the same,  
Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,  
I know when kids rockin(?) used to beat the block, I lived in a little house
boy,  
And the block party would never stop, I remember when G-Lyfe was when I had
that little jelly bean,  
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and  
Cut Supreme,(?) I built the school and shot Marvin that's what I did,  
I remember the curfews what we used to get(?).  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin' again,  
When you speaking bout' Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins,  
There born and raised,  
God done made it hard for us,  
'Cause y'all outta towners came here and fucked shit up,  
But y'all can't fuck with us, cause as soon as shit start goin on you leave
Atlanta and go right back home,  
And that's the pussy mother fucker,  
Ya heard me motherfucker, bring off in there mouth (?) ATL-ANTA,  
Stop asking me cause that why I stay, if you can spell,  
That's Atlant motherfucker, ya heard me mother fucker,  
So don't ask me again,  
'Cause I ain't saying it again,  
Let me ask you do you remember jelly bean Cherri Show Case Club sense in tha

Lemme tell you about some ghettos,

Ghetto classics (ghetto), ghetto classics  
Time for us to find just a little piece of mind, talkin' bout  
Them ghetto classics (ghetto), ghetto classics  
  
We just black people gone and lost our mind  
We just really trying to draw the line  
Before it left our eyes  
Before we get left behind  
Let me tell you something about hard times  
Before we used to walk  
Before we had life in the dry  
And 911 wasn't known outside  
We didn't know how to read  
We didn't know how to write  
All we did was sing all day and all night  
Then when they let us start learning  
You all lose y'all mind  
And y'all forgot about the earlier times  
When Martin Luther King had a dream  
That one day we'd walk together  
We really need to get it together  
Kids stay in school  
Learn all you can  
Graduate, go to college, get knowledge  
Then we shall overcome, yes we can, we  
In the urge of faith we can demand it, for real

Huh, 2, 3, 4  
What the hell are we fighting for?  
Passing off  
Relationship's done what spore  
that's why they got the door  
More time, hoot hoot  
Aim aim, shoot shoot  
ain't nothing but the young kids they recruit  
Its a wonder they don't come home in they suit  
I took away some time  
Thinkin' how i could, should, would be  
If everybody in the world was free  
No crime nobody doing wrong  
Everybody getting along  
But when i step into reality  
This world is sore  
And that's why we at war  
Killin' ourselves over bullshit  
That we valued more than life  
y'all people better to get right, cause...

Well, hoes done hurt mine

So I'm a dog to a broad  
Have 'em all crying,

That don't make me a hoe  
That just show me where my feelin's ain't supposed to go  
See, I got the magic stick you dumb bitch  
Other nigga you fuck with, be on some punk shit  
And I'm gonna show you all I don't need no help,  
Just as soon as I loosen my belt  
Bitch!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need a moment,  
I can't stand bitches and hoes  
'cause a bitch is a bitch and a hoe gonna hoe,  
But a woman hold her own  
She got her own home  
She drive her own car  
Buying drinks at the bar  
Take a nigga out to eat  
Take a nigga to the mall  
Treat a nigga good  
And wash a nigga draws  
But bitches ain't shit,  
Always talking shit  
They wanna be the shit  
But is they shit? No  
And hoes, they fuck off the god damn chain  
Everything and everything but don't take names  
So that's a nasty hoe and I can't do shit wit it  
Please get out my face I don't need a case  
Yeah, I love you all respectful women  
Independent women  
I takes 'em out all the time  
But you all hit the baggage need to keep on tracking  
I ain't speaking I ain't talking to nothing  
'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just keep my name out you mouth  
Before you find out how a down south hoe will out  
You're a hater, she's a hater, three a hater, for  
Everywhere I go I see some hating ass hoes  
Southern Belle, Jazzy Belle, Never Monogamous  
?? be hot because my deeper esophagus  
Still they run up on me, smile and phone me,  
Laugh 'cause soon as I turn my back they stab it  
Learn to play fair  
Stop trying to care  
Two hoes to one nigga,  
Bitch, learn to share  
Baby, you dead ass broke  
For hating on the rich chicks  
See how I flow?  
Bitch, put it on you wish list  
Two seater wit the chill on  
My baby daddy put the grill on  
Fixing to put the heels on  
Chrome spokes with the low pros  
And the trunk funk blows up the cedar on the dashboard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the men's national anthem for this year  
All you real women,  
You all can sing this shit too  
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe,  
You can sing this shit too  
If you a bitch and you hate and bitch,  
You can sing this shit too  
So everybody's gonna sing this shit  
I hate hoes, they hate me too  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Bitch!

[Intro: D-Roc]  
I know what you go through  
From me to you, I love you  
  
[Verse 1: D-Roc]  
From the nigga to the baller, never satisfied  
So the money got you doing shit that'll fuck up your pride  
You ain't a hoe, you just really trying to get by  
Every day looking up at the sky  
Sometimes, shit get so hard  
It really have you bothered  
First you sigh, then you cry  
Up a whole puddle of water  
Seem like this shit won't ever end  
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds  
Waves turn to a hurricane  
If you see joy, you got to see pain  
Shit in the world ain't gonna ever change  
Even when you die, it'll be the same  
Now you due to them circumstances  
Jars aren't counted so your forced to dance  
Hoping and praying for a second chance  
Just wanna put back on your pants  
Walk out the club and throw up your hands  
Tired of being disrespected by her man  
Think this shit ain't right for you  
Niggaz been yellin all night for you  
Got in your mind what's best for you  
Walk up to the club to tell them your through  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
She's stuck off in this little room  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Her life is in a little box  
She's wondering will it ever stop?  
The life of a stripper  
  
[Hook: Girl]  
I'm so sick and I'm so tired  
Of these clubs, I keep crying  
Every night, I wipe my eyes  
Cause these years pass me by  
I give up, I'm all in  
My whole life is full of sin  
This road is a dead end  
I wanna live again  
  
[D-Roc]  
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord  
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard  
Which is kinda left up to the teachers  
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers  
the preachers ain't fillin' up the bleachers  
It's the rappers  
Sad, ain't it  
  
[Verse 2: Kane]  
It was this girl named Star, pretty fine little woman  
Going to college, taking off her clothes for money  
She gotta pay the rent, she got a little girl  
Her baby daddy ain't shit, See what she dealin with?  
But she gotta hold on (hold on)  
Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)  
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime  
She like "fuck how she feel" living is real  
So she back in the club again  
Taking off her clothes again  
Going to school, going to work, getting tiring  
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat  
and these shoes on her feet  
She got a test next week so she stressed  
Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction  
Her parents died when she was eight years old  
And after that, she felt like she was all alone  
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well  
Keep going to school, take care of yourself  
Getting hard, going to school and work in the club  
And at the same time looking for love  
She can't keep skipping for an occupation  
In a minute, she'll be graduating  
Make her wanna throw up her hands  
Now she only wanna live again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Chorus]

Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Up in the street and misguided never payed attention  
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided  
to let my soul confide with the lights of him  
Who the father, my bread and my water  
I never bought a cue and into this (?)  
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites  
It'll take your life to be a Christian man  
I hope you learn, everything else  
Is in vein so you're bound to burn  
Gonna break your bone  
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule  
Trying take control of you  
That's all the devil do  
God was in Jesus, God is in us  
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust  
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes,  
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone  
I never understood why what can make a man cry,  
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side  
  
Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene  
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again  
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose  
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle  
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love  
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you want to bust  
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying  
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel  
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing  
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms,  
Judgment was man-made, not a [..], and this I recorded,  
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat,  
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell,  
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here  
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked
up in jail here  
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near,  
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear,  
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games,  
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing  
  
Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And Girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin' you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I can never make it, I can never ever make it  
Without you baby  
Cause you've been my best friend  
Girl,  
When everybody turned their back on me,  
You were there when I fell down on my knees  
And I give you all, all of me,  
And every part of me, oooowoooo,  
  
Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(For long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I'm a live, I will never leave o no no  
When the people say, c'mon and go with me  
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend  
nobody understand, but they can't look inside of me,  
o yeah..  
[fade out]

[Chorus]  
They don't know how far back that we go (we go)  
From riding skates, to riding 24's  
From off the block hustlin' to rockin' shows  
We done seen many bumps in the road  
But still we remain, still in the game  
Never worry , about them haters, that will never change  
And I put this on everything babe  
I am my brother's keeper.  
  
Listen D-roc, I know you don't think I care for ya,  
But at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya,  
And anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of  
They ass man and that's from the heart.  
Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends,  
We seem to have plenty of friends. excuse me then friend,  
Let me borrow a stack and when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back.  
If they can't do that they don't contribute to the answer ? from the ?  
Serious as cancer. If I was jojo dancer I would do the same thang,  
Not to let another man spark my flame. D-roc is the ying,  
Kain is the yang but without  
The both of us we ain't got a damn thang.  
Its me and my brother, my brother and me, all that you see on TV  
  
[Chorus]  
  
United states of Atlanta its still me  
And my brother we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya.  
Blood, sweat, and tears, good days and bad from  
The time you make me laugh you made me mad.  
I still got cha back but imma take ya way back  
When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack, scraping up  
Change trying to make 2 dollars or 3 to get  
Some 99 cent hamburgers to eat  
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car.  
Back then we was some  
Underground superstars and these last 5 years we done put work in,  
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins.  
Even though we don't spend time at home  
Together, we hit the road and its like we never left each other.  
Now that's love,  
I love you til the day that I leave so its still my brother and me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People of the world we must change our mind frame  
And stay away from the con and mind games.  
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time, steady  
Working hard but you bareky gettin by trying  
To make a line between stress and peace  
And satan always gettin the best of me,  
My closest of kin, my best  
Friend, man we all in the struggle  
But you gotta remember I'm yo brother.  
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother,  
Helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all.  
Don't leave these babies out here all alone they  
Don't know what's going on. THey don't know right from wrong,  
So when you see yo brother give him a hug  
And a shoulder to lean on and don't leave him out here  
On his own cause times gettin hard these days.  
We at war amongest ourselves and we at war overseas brother.  
  
[Chorus]

Start saying all type of shit out of her lips  
And let me tell you what I can't stand  
When a women play the role of a man  
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand  
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand  
I know you know I ain't gone go for the short jacking all the time  
Talking to me out of line broad, truly you done lost your mind

And I'm going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl  
The way you talking absurd, gettin on my nerves  
All in my ear about to make me hit the curve

Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
I'm tired of listening to your naggin  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
One day I got shot by Cupid  
This was when this relationship went stupid  
We was talking on the phone too long  
Now her ass isn't home  
Tellin me you out with your friends  
Find out later on you with your other men  
You ain't nothing but a dividend  
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin  
That's a damn shame it ended like this  
And I ain't got love for you bitch  
Shoo fly don' bother me  
Will I get back with her probably  
Then I thought about it I won't  
Do I really want you I don't  
The headache I really don't want  
So I'm going to leave her alone  
Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone  
Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
I'm tired listenin to your naggin  
[Chorus]

Tell you something that you might like to hear  
You got a sexy ass body and your ass look soft  
Mind if i touch it? and see if its soft

And I'm known to be a real nasty man  
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed  
So i don't mind asking for head

And you can start usin' yo head  
You like to fuck, have yo legs open all in da butt  
Do it up slappin ass 'cause the sex gets rough  
Switch the positions and ready to get down to business
