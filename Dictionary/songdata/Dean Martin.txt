It's a marshmallow world in the winter  
When the snow comes to cover the ground  
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day  
I wait for it the whole year round  
  
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly  
In the arms of the evergreen trees  
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head  
It's shining so your nose won't freeze  
  
Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows  
That's how it goes, whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
  
Oh, it's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts  
Take a walk with your favorite girl  
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late  
In winter it's a marshmallow world  
  
It's a marshmallow world in the winter  
When the snow comes to cover the ground  
It's time for play, it's a whipped cream day  
I wait for it the whole year round  
  
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly  
In the arms of the evergreen trees  
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head  
It's shining so your nose won't freeze  
  
Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows  
That's how it goes, whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
  
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts  
Take a walk with your favorite girl  
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late  
In winter it's a marshmallow world

(How many teardrops)  
Have I cried over you  
A million and one tears  
A million and two  
(How many lonely nights)  
Have my arms ached for you  
A million and one nights  
A million and two  
Loving you darlin'  
While I thought you loved me, only me  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
How many sweet dreams  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
(Loving you darlin'  
While I thought you loved me, only me)  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
(How many sweet dreams)  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
  

I'd rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind  
Here I am with wealth untold  
The moonlight is my silver the sunshine is my gold  
I'd rather have a shanty filled with laughter  
Than a palace someone's tears designed  
Lady luck and I keep walking hand in glove  
Got a gal who loves me for nothing but my love  
I'd rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind  
I'd rather have a shanty filled with laughter  
Than a palace someone's tears designed  
Lady luck and I keep walking hand in glove  
Got a gal who loves me for nothing but my love  
I'd rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind  
  
  

I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Give me my ranch and my cattle  
Far from the greed city's rattle  
Give me a big herd to battle  
For I just love herding the cattle  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Give me my bridle and saddle  
And my old pinto I'll straddle  
I'll get the cowboys a-riding  
Out where the rustlers are hiding  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying I'm a-roping and a-tying  
I'm a-roping and a-tying  
  
Sometimes the winter storms tearing  
Set all the cattle a-rearing  
But when the winter is over  
We're sure enough in the clover  
  
Alla en la rancho grande  
Alla donde vivia  
Habia una ranche rita  
Que alegre me decia  
Que alegre me decia

There's something strange in the old corral  
There's a breeze, though the wind has died  
Though I'm alone in the old corral,  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,  
The strays of long ago,  
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border,  
Or a band of Navajo  
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely,  
As ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,  
There's no song, still I hear guitars,  
There is no dust, still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars  
  
[Chorus]

I tell you every street's a boulevard in old New York

Everybody, everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody's got someone carin'  
Everybody's got a love they're sharin'  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody's gettin' ready  
Everybody is goin' steady  
Everybody, everybody but me  
I stay home on a Friday nights

Everybody loves somebody sometime  
Everybody falls in love somehow  
Something in your kiss just told me  
That sometime is now  
  
Everybody finds somebody someplace  
There's no telling where love may appear  
Something in my heart keeps saying  
My someplace is here  
  
If I had it in my power  
I'd arrange for every girl to have you charms  
Then every minute, every hour  
Everybody would find what I found in your arms  
  
Everybody loves somebody sometime  
And though my dreams were overdue  
Your love made it all worth waiting  
For someone like you

Your love made it all worth waiting  
For someone like you

Far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Far away over the sea  
  
Those far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Are calling, calling me  
  
Going to China or maybe Siam  
  
I want to see for myself  
  
Those far away places I've been reading about  
  
In a book that I took from the shelf  
  
I start getting restless whenever I hear  
  
The whistles of a train  
  
I pray for the day I can get under way  
  
And look for those castles in Spain  
  
Oh they call me a dreamer  
  
Well maybe I am  
  
But I know that I'm burning to see  
  
Those far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Calling, calling me

He was king at five card stud  
The stranger's game was five card stud  
He was hard to beat  
Rather played an e  
As long as it was five card stud  
When he played he played for blood  
  
You had better beware  
Bet your poke and he'd leave you broke and he'd make a joke as he slidely  
Grinned  
Then he'd say "It's enough today!" and he'd run away like the wind  
Stud was all he lived and breathed  
  
Never played to hand the same  
He could bluff you bluff you blind,  
Could swear that  
He invented the game  
How he loved that five card stud  
Life to him was five card stud  
When he played he played for blood  
He was king at five card stud

Five foot two, eyes of blue  
But, oh, what those five foot could do  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
  
Turned up nose and turned down hose  
Never had another beau  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
  
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur  
Diamond ring and all those things  
Bet your life it isn't hers  
Could she love? Could she woo?  
Could she love? Could she coo?  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
  
Five foot two, eyes of blue  
But, oh, what those five foot could do  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur  
Diamond ring and all those things  
Bet your life that it wasn't her  
  
Could she loving? Could she coo?  
Could she? Could she woo?  
Has anyone seen my gal?

Fools rush in where angels fear to thread  
And so I come to you my love, my heart above my head  
Though I see the danger there  
If there's a chance for me then I don't care  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love so how are they to know  
When we met I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
When we met I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Don't look so sad, I know it's over  
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning  
Let's be glad we had some time to spend together  
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times  
  
I'll get along, you'll find another  
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me  
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times

I will gather stars out of the blue  
For you for you  
I'll make a string of pearls out of the dew  
For you just for you  
  
Over the highway and over the street  
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet  
Oh there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do  
For you for you  
  
Over the highway and over the street  
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet  
Ah there ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do  
For you just for you

When they tell you I'm dating  
With somebody new  
Don't you know that I'm playing a part  
Forgetting you  
I still want you to want me  
Though you said we're through  
Can't you see that I don't want to start  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's breaking my heart  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's busting my heart  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you

It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your
couch  
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line  
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
  
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds
me  
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking  
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk
along some railroad track by the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
  
Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some
train yard  
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
  
Cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find that you're waving from the back
roads by the river of my memory  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind

Gigi  
Am I a fool without a mind  
Or have I merely been too blind to realize  
Oh Gigi  
  
Why you've been growing up before my very eyes  
Gigi  
You're not at all that funny awkward little girl I knew  
Oh no  
  
Overnight there's been a breathless change in you  
Oh Gigi  
While you were trembling on the brink  
Oh Gigi  
  
Have I been standing up too close or back too far  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire  
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are  
  
Gigi  
While you were trembling on the brink  
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star  
Oh Gigi  
  
Have I been standing up too close or back too far  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire  
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are

Glow little glow worm flier fire  
Glow like an incandescent wire  
Glow for the female of the specie  
Turn on the AC and the DC  
This night could use a little brightening  
Light up your little bug of lightning  
When you gotta glow you gotta glow  
Glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm turn the key on  
You are equipped with tail light neon  
You got a cute vest pocket Mazda  
Which you can make both slow or faster  
I don't know who you took a shine to  
Or who you're out to make a sign to  
I gotta gal that I love so glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm glow

(Go go go go)  
Come on and dance with me  
(Go go go go)  
In to a trance with me  
(Go go go go)  
And try romance with me  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go  
(Go go go go)  
The music's bright tonight  
(Go go go go)  
And hold me tight tonight  
(Go go go go)  
I fell so right tonight  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go  
This heart of mine is beating overtime  
It's four leaf clover time  
(It's love) It's love, it's love, it's love  
(Go go go go)  
And swing me round the floor  
(Go go go go)  
And kiss me more and more  
(Go go go go)  
What are we waiting for  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go go go  
Go go go go  

Good morning life  
Good morning sun how are your skies above  
Gee it's great to be alive and in love  
Good morning life  
Good morning birds sing out your happy tunes  
Feels so good because I'll be seeing her soon  
Last night she said she loved me  
What a pity to part  
I slept with both eyes open waiting for today to start  
Good morning life

Goodnight, my love  
The tired old moon is descending  
Goodnight, my love  
My moment with you is now ending  
  
It was so heavenly  
Holding you close to me  
It will be heavenly  
To hold you again in a dream  
  
The stars above  
Have promised to meet us tomorrow  
Till then my love  
How dreary the new day will seem  
So for the present dear  
We'll have to part  
Sleep tight, my love  
Goodnight, my love  
Remember that you're mine, sweetheart  
  
Sleep tight, my love  
Goodnight, my love  
Remember that you're mine, sweetheart

Goodnight sweetheart  
Til we meet tomorrow  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Sleep will vanish sorrow  
Tears and parting may make us forlorn  
But with the dawn a new day is born  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Though I'm not beside you  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Still my love will guide you  
Dreams will enfold you  
In each one I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Dreams will enfold you  
In each one I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart goodnight

The old home town looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
Down the road, I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms a'reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me  
At four gray walls that surround me  
And I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm and arm, we'll walk at daybreak  
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home  

You take a hammer, you get some nails, you build a home  
Find a woman put that woman in that little home  
But without love, true, true love in that home  
Yes, without love, that little home just ain't a home  
You cheat a little, you leave your baby all alone  
You bend the nails, you walk the boards in that little home  
'cause without love, true, true love in that home  
Yes, without love that little home can't be a home  
Yes, without love in that home  
There ain't a hammer big enough  
So when your nights of fun are through  
Don't be surprised to find yourself there all alone  
'cause without love, true, true love in that home  
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home  
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home  
  

Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips  
Tell me what I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me  
Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips  
Tell me all I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me  

Sound of rain on the window pain  
Makes a mighty sweet and soft refrain  
But I never found a sound as sweet  
As the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Mocking bird never says a word  
But his pretty music must be heard  
Well there is no music with a beat of  
The tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Honey when we're dancing  
It is so divine  
Count of we're much closer  
Closer than quarter to nine  
  
The band down in Dixieland  
Got a rhythm makes you clap your hand  
But there is no rhythm I repeat  
Like the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Honey when we're dancing  
It is so divine  
Account of we're much closer  
Closer than quarter to nine  
  
I love the band down in Dixieland  
I got a rhythm makes you clap your hand  
But there is no rhythm I repeat  
Like the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
The tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet

Have a little sympathy  
Won't you hurry home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
  
I haven't seen a sunny day  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Have a little sympathy  
Have a little sympathy  
  
Won't you hurry on home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
Well I haven't seen a sunny day  
  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Baby won't you hurry home  
  
Dino's waiting all alone  
Have a little sympathy

Hear my heart hear the sound it makes of love  
The sound that whispers I love only you  
Every beat seems to tell me that we'll meet  
Yet I know you're meeting someone new  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again

I love you so much that I can't leave you  
Even though my mind tells me I should  
Then you make me think you really love me  
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good  
You got me heart over mind, worried all the time  
Knowing you will always be the same  
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go  
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change  
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change  
Now friends tell me they see you out with others  
In my heart I try hard to forget  
You come home and tell me you still love me  
I still hope there's some chance for us yet  
You got me heart over mind, worried all the time  
Knowing you will always be the same  
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go  
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change  
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change  
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change  

I got your picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got your picture, he's got you  
I got your records that we used to share  
And they still sound the same as when you lived here  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the records, he's got you  
I've got your memory or has it got me  
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be  
I've got your class ring that proved you care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I've got these little thing, he's got you  
I've got your memory or has it got me  
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be  
I've got your class ring that proved your care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I've got the little thing, he's got you

Here we sit enjoying the shade  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Drink the drink that I have made  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Tell you why the day is sunny  
I'm in love with lips of honey  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She is coming here to stay  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
I have waited for the day  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She writes of love in every letter  
Others have tried but I will get her  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
What is life? What is spring?  
What are all the stars that shine?  
Love, my friend is everything  
And love will soon be mine  
Pour it as quickly as you can  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour it quickly once again  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She's here at last my one and only  
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely  
Wait 'til you see the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Blink your eyes and love has passed  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Her's was never made to last  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
She introduced me to another  
No my friends, he's not her brother  
I will miss the way she walks  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour the wine, pour the wine  
Hey brother, pour the wine  
Pour the wine  

Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
We could find us a brand new recipe?  
I got a Hot Rod car and a two dollar bill  
I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancin's free  
And if wanna have fun come along with me  
Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about savin' all your time for me?  
No more lookin', I know I've been tooken  
How's about keepin' steady company?  
Throw my date book over the fence  
Find me one for five or ten cents

'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page  
Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up  
How's about cookin' somethin' up  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

See the tree how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig  
Then the first snow came  
And she ran out to brush the snow away  
It wouldn't die  
Came running in all excited  
Slipped and almost hurt herself  
I laughed till I cried  
She was always young at heart  
Kinda dumb and kinda smart  
I loved her so  
I surprised her with a puppy  
Kept me up all Christmas Eve  
Two years ago  
It would sure embarrass her  
When I came home from working late  
'Cause I would know  
That she'd been sitting there and crying  
Over some sad and silly  
Late, late show  
And Honey, I miss you  
I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
She wrecked the car and she was sad  
And so afraid that I'd be mad  
But what the heck  
Though I pretended hard to be  
Guess you could say she saw through me  
And hugged my neck  
I came home unexpectedly  
And found her crying needlessly  
In the middle of the day  
It was in the early spring  
When flowers bloom and robins sing  
She went away  
And Honey, I miss you  
And I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
Yes, one day while I wasn't home  
When she was there and all alone  
The angels came  
Now all I have is memories  
Of Honey and I wake up nights  
And call her name  
Now my life's an empty stage  
Where Honey lived and Honey played  
And love grew up  
A small cloud passes overhead  
And cries down in the flower bed  
That Honey loved  
See the tree, how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig  

How do you speak to an angel  
I'm completely in the dark  
When you know that you've just met an angel  
Is there a proper remark  
We were alone for a moment  
Why was I lost in a cloud  
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  
Or do you just say I love you out loud  
We were alone for a moment  
Why was I lost in a cloud  
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  
Or do you just say I love you out loud

Your eyes are blue your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
You're telling everyone I know  
I'm on your mind each place you go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me  
I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe that you're in love  
Can't believe that you're in love  
Can't believe that you're in love with me

Love love love you baby  
Love love love you baby love you  
Well I can't give you anything but love baby  
That's the only thing I've plenty of baby  
You dream awhile and you scheme awhile  
You're sure to find happiness and  
I guess all the things you think are fine  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth won't sell to you baby  
Til the lucky day you know darn well baby  
I can't give you anything but love  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth ain't gonna sell to you baby  
Til the lucky day you know darn well baby  
Well I can't give you anything but love

(I can't help it if I'm still in love with you)  
Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart fell at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
A picture from the past came slowly stealing  
  
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
And suddenly I got that old time feeling  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
(It's hard to know when others' lips will kiss you)  
  
(And hold you just the way I used to do)  
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
Well I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why you, just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why you, just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why but you do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do

You don't smile like you used to smile  
You don't laugh like you used to laugh  
You're trying to pretend but what for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
You don't kiss like you kissed me before  
The spark of love isn't there anymore  
I love you everyday but what for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
It's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
  
Your loving touch isn't there anymore  
You don't care like you cared before  
So darling, what am I waiting for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
And it's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
And it's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me

I feel a song comin' on  
And I'm warning ya  
It's a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain!  
I feel a song comin' on  
It's a melody!  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain!  
You'll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin' thru ya!  
Love and glory!  
Hallelujah!  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'  
Cause I feel a song comin' on!  
  
I feel a song comin' on  
And I'm warning ya  
It's a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain!  
I feel a song comin' on  
It's a melody!  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain!  
You'll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin' thru ya!  
Love and glory!  
Hallelujah!  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'  

I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Riding on high, high in the sky  
Honey and I walking on air  
Since the moment that she told me she cared  
Feel like a feather in the breeze  
Floating through space in your embrace  
Dancing on clouds way up above  
Since the second that you beckoned my love  
I'm happy  
So happy when you're near  
My troubles just disappear  
As soon as you're by my side well I'm satisfied  
I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Having my fun, kissing the sun  
And it's because you are the one  
So I'm singing like the birdies in the trees  
And feeling like a feather in a breeze  
I'm happy  
So happy when you're near  
My troubles just disappear  
As soon as you're by my side well I'm satisfied  
I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Having my fun, kissing the sun  
And it's because you are the one  
So I'm singing like the birdies in the trees  
And feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather in the breeze  
  
  

I got no diamond though I'm shy  
Still I think I'm a lucky guy  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I've got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight gives me the milky way  
Got no checkbook got no bank  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening  
I'm all right  
I got no diamonds? though I'm shy  
Still I think I'm a lucky guy  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion go no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I've got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight gives me the milky way  
Got no checkbook got no bank  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening  
I'm all right

(I love the way you say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you mumble while you fumble for the key  
More time for kissing me  
(I love the way you say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you linger with your finger on the bell  
More kisses and they're swell  
When you say gotta get home by twelve  
I always say let's go  
'cause you can take longer to say good night than any three others I know  
(Both) I love the way you say goodnight  
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb  
Mmmmmm I'm never never never going home  
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the way you always say) good
night  
(The way you always whisper honey nighty night)  
The way you let our kisses mingle 'til I tingle to my toes  
(giggle ... We're blushing like a rose)  
I love the way (I kinda like the way the extraordinary way) you say good night
(the way you always say don't go just hold me tight)  
I kinda like the way you giggle while you jiggle with your bag  
(sign ... our heart's are playing tag)  
When you say (we just got to be home by twelve)  
But don't I always say let's go 'cause you take longer to say good night than
any three others I know  
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the super duper special way)
goodnight  
(The way you have me flying higher than a kite)  
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb  
(It looks as though you're never going)  
No I'm never never never never never never gonna go home  
  
  

I love you much too much  
I've known it from the start  
But yet my love is such  
I can't control my heart  
I love you much too much  
I ask myself what for  
And darling when we touch  
I love you more  
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly  
But who am I to say  
If I should hold it lightly  
It might slip away  
I love you much too much  
You've never really known  
I love you oh so much  
I'm yours alone  
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly  
But who am I to say  
If I should hold it lightly  
It might slip away  
I love you much too much  
You've never really known  
I love you oh so much  
I'm yours alone

I met a girl a wonderful girl  
Who's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl  
Fabulous creature without any doubt  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
She's just a girl an everyday girl  
And yet I guess she's really rather special for a girl  
For once you've seen her the others are not  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
But so what what has she got others have not  
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those  
But when she looks up at me what do I see  
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race  
Hey I met a girl a marvelous girl  
She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl  
Found me a treasure and I want to shout  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
But so what what has she got others have not  
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those  
But when she looks up at me what do I see  
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race  
(I got a girl a marvelous girl)  
(She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl)  
Found me a treasure and I want to shout  
This is what am I getting so excited about  
(He met a girl) and I fell in love today

I passed your house tonight  
And I stood outside  
I passed your house tonight  
And I almost cried  
  
Oh how I missed seeing you waiting at the door for me  
And wondered if your heart asked anymore for me  
Then all at once I knew  
You no longer cared  
  
I saw two silhouettes in the window there  
Two silhouettes in the window that kissed by candle light  
And so I passed your house tonight  
Two silhouettes in the window that kissed by candle light  
And so I passed your house tonight

I ran all the way home  
Just to tell you that I'm sorry  
I really didn't mean to be  
So mean to you  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to beg you to forgive me  
I want your love to be my own  
Just mine alone

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds  
Because you're mine,  
I walk the line  
  
I find it very, very easy to be true  
I find myself alone when each day is through  
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you  
Because you're mine,  
I walk the line  
  
As sure as night is dark and day is light  
I keep you on my mind both day and night  
And happiness I've known proves that it's right  
Because you're mine,  
I walk the line  
  
You've got a way to keep me on your side  
You give me cause for love that I can't hide  
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide  
Because you're mine,  
I walk the line

I wonder who's kissing her now  
I wonder who's teaching her now  
I wonder who's looking right smack in the eyes  
Oh breathing sighs and telling lies  
  
Well I wonder who's buying the wine  
For the lips that I used to call mine  
Well I wonder if she ever tells him of me  
Wonder who's kissing her now  
  
Oh I wonder who's buying the wine  
For the lips that I used to call mine  
Well I wonder if she ever tells him of me  
I wonder who's kissing her now

I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye,  
I'd feel like a snowball on the fourth of July,  
If you ever said you were leaving for good,  
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would.  
  
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon,  
I'd let out a wail that would be heard on the moon,  
Our love was so splendid, don't end it so soon  
Don't leave me here sighing, a-sobbing and a-sighing,  
Crying like a baby for you.  
  
I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye,

If I knew then what I know now  
If I knew then you'd be here right now  
I'd trade the world and its gold  
To have and to hold  
The one thing in life I love  
If I knew then oh what I know now  
We would never have drifted apart  
If I Had only taken your dream and made it part of mine  
If I knew then oh what I know now

If I should love again  
If I should love again  
I'll give my love to nobody else but you  
You've been so dear to me  
You've made things clear to me  
And I can see the wonderful dreams come true  
  
When hearts are broken  
And romance ends  
One tender word of love is spoken and then it mends  
So here's to love again  
If I should love again  
I'll give my love to nobody else but you  
  
So here's to love again  
If I should love again  
I'll give my love to nobody else but you

Spring will come and grass will grow  
The brooks will hum with melted snow  
If love is good to me  
Clouds will cry and rain will fall  
The earth will sigh and drink it all  
If love is good to me  
There always will be skies of blue above me  
Just as long as Mother Nature makes you love me  
Leaves will fall from winter's chill  
I'll recall a summer thrill  
That once you gave to me  
These wonderous things each year  
Depend on you my dear  
This all could be  
If love is good to me  
If love is good to me  
If love is good to me  
There always will be skies of blue above me  
Just as long as Mother Nature makes you love me  
Leaves will fall from winter's chill and  
I'll recall a summer thrill  
That once you gave to me  
These wonderous things each year  
Depend on you my dear  
This all could be  
If love is good to me  
This all could be  
If love is good to me  
  

If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl  
There's none so classy  
As this fair lassie, oh, oh  
  
Holy Moses, what a chassis  
We went riding, she didn't balk  
Back from Yonkers  
I'm the one that had to walk  
  
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl  
She wears long tresses  
And nice tight dresses, oh, oh  
  
What a future she possesses  
Out in public, how she can yawn?  
In a parlor you would think  
The war was on  
  
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl

Day after day I'll always love you  
Where just to say I'll always love you  
Dear one, your nearness is my treasure  
Dear one, your kiss is rich as wine  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so

I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces all day through  
In that small cafe, the park across the way  
The children's carousel,  
The chestnut trees, the wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find you in the morning' sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you

Imagine me with my head on your shoulder  
And you with your lips getting bolder  
A sky full of moon and a sweet, mellow tune  
I'll buy that dream  
Imagine you in a gown white and flowery  
And you thanking Dad for your dowry  
A church full of folks and those last minute jokes  
I'll buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo, with a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little low crazy palace  
Oh, it's not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It doesn't sound bad, and if it can be had  
I'll buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo, in a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little coo-coo palace  
It's not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It don't sound bad, and if it can be had  
I'll buy that dream  

There'll be lots of tears plus some happy years  
And you'll add my heart to your souvenirs  
But loving you was my mistake  
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I'll be on the town acting like a clown  
So they won't suspect that you turned me down  
Loving you was my mistake  
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I've love for you  
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt I'm the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes, I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I've love for you  
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart right in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece that you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt I'm the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes, yes, yes, gladly make the same mistake again  

I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
Like you'd never been held before  
I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away  
Till you are in my arms once more  
  
The stars up in the sky know the reason why  
I feel so blue when I'm away from you  
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
So darling please wait for me  
  
(The stars up in the sky know the reason why)  
I feel so blue when I'm away from you  
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
So darling please wait for me

I'm confessin' that I love you  
Tell me, do you love me too?  
I'm confessin' that I need you  
Honest I do, need you every moment  
In your eyes I read such strange things  
But your lips deny they're true  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue?  
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me  
Saying, "Can't we still be friends?"  
If you go, you know you'll grieve me  
All in life on you depends  
Am I guessing that you love me  
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?  
I'm confessing that I love you, over again  

I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then like my dreams they fade and die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They f-f-fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then in my d-d-dreams they fade and d-d-die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles, no more troubles  
Pretty bubbles in the air

I'm gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
I'm gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine  
And show you all the vows you made in black and white  
But if you think you're fooling me with your love love letters  
Well baby, now it's time you knew the score  
I'm gonna find somebody new to write me love letters  
And paper them all over yours  
  
I'm gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
I'm gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine

Well baby, now it's time you knew the score

And paper them all over yours  
All over yours

Baby doll I'm gonna steal you away  
Baby doll I'm gonna steal you away  
One of these nights when all is still  
I'm gonna climb your windowsill  
And if my plans work OK  
I'm gonna steal you away  
When everyone is fast asleep  
Into your room I'll softly creep  
And in my cloak of misty gray  
I'm gonna steal you away  
What if detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find us, they wouldn't jail me  
Though I was stealing, they'd set me free  
When they see that we're married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
It's gonna be elopement day  
I'm gonna steal you away  
But if the detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find me, they wouldn't jail me  
Though I was stealing, they let me be free  
When they see that we're married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
It's gonna be elopement day  
I'm gonna steal you away  
I'm gonna steal you  
Baby, I'm gonna steal you away

I'm sitting on top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along  
  
And I'm quittin' the blues of the world  
Just singin' a song, just singin' a song  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top of the world  
Just rollin' along, oh, rollin' along  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top, top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top, top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind the cloud  
To hide his face and cry  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Ask the sky above and ask the earth below  
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so  
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear  
Just why dear I'm yours  
When you went away you left a glowing spark  
Trying to be gay is whistling in the dark  
I am only what you make me  
Come take me, I'm yours how happy  
I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you  
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through  
If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours  
If we drift apart then I'll be left alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours

Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
  
Imagination it's so crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
Starts you asking a daisy what to do, what to do  
Have you ever felt the gentle touch and then a kiss and then and then  
  
Find it's only your imagination again, oh well  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
  
And yet I can't imagine that you  
Can't imagine that you  
Can't imagine you want me too

In a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
  
It was on a night like this  
  
I whispered be true to me and she sighed si si si  
  
Man the skies have turned to gray because we're far apart  
  
Many moons have passed away and still she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss  
  
Ah, in a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
  
  
I whispered be true to me and she sighed oh si si  
  
Man the skies have turned to gray because we're far apart  
  
Many moons have passed away and still she's in my heart

In Napoli beside the sea  
It happened on a night like this  
In Napoli our hearts were free  
And we surrendered to a kiss  
There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli  
There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli

How I'd love to hear the organ  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
While we're strolling down the aisle  
Where roses entwine  
  
How I'd love to hear you whisper  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
That the love light in your eyes  
Forever will shine  
  
'Til the roses turn to ashes  
'Til the organ turns to rust  
If you never come I'll still be there  
'Til the moonlight turns to dust  
  
How I'd love to hear the choir  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
As they sing "Oh Promise Me"  
Forever be mine

Sue wants a barbecue  
Sam wants to boil ham  
Grace votes for bouillabaisse stew  
Jake wants a wienie bake, steak and a layer cake  
He'll get a tummy ache too  
  
We'll rent a tent or tepee  
Let the town crier cry  
And if it's RSVP  
This is what I'll reply  
  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
You better save a chair  
When the party's getting a glow on  
Singing fills the air  
In the shank of the night when the doings are right  
You can tell 'em I'll be there  
  
We, said the bumblebee, let's have a jubilee  
When said the prairie hen, soon  
Sure said the dinosaur  
Where said the grizzly bear  
Under the light of the moon  
How 'bout your brother jackass  
Everyone gave a cry  
You coming to the fracas  
Over his expected sighs  
  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Tell 'em I'll be there  
In the cool cool cool of the evening  
Slickum on my hair  
When the party's getting a glow on  
Singing fills the air  
If I ain't in the clink  
And there's something to drink  
You can tell 'em I'll be there  
If I can find the right sock by eleven o'clock  
You can tell 'em I'll be there  
If you need a new face or a tenor off base  
You can tell 'em I'll be there  
If I can climb out of bed, put a hat on my head  
You can tell 'em I'll be there

In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as I'm with you  
  
In a far away land  
On a tropic sea sand  
If your hand's in my hand  
I won't be blue  
  
Way up on a mountain  
Way down in a valley  
I know I'll be happy  
Any place anywhere  
I don't care  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as you are there  
  
In the misty moonlight  
By the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right  
Long as I'm with you  
In a far away land

Is it true what they say about Dixie  
Does the sun really shine all the time  
Do the sweet magnolias blossom at everybody's door  
Do the folks keep eating possum til they can't eat no more  
  
Is it true what they say about Swanny  
Is a dream by the stream so sublime  
Do they laugh do they love like they say in every song  
If it's true that's where I belong  
  
Is it true what they say about Dixie

Is it true what they say about Swanny  
Is a dream by the stream so sublime  
Do they laugh love like they say in every song  
If it's true that's where I belong

It takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long, long time  
Tonight my love the moonbeams shine  
Upon your dream and mine  
So take my kiss to sleep with you  
This kiss of love divine  
Oh it takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long, long time  
(So take my kiss to sleep with you  
This kiss of love divine)  
Oh it takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long, long time  
Goodbye is a long, long time  
  

The flame that we kindled hasn't dwindled at all  
It just keeps burning burning burning it won't cool off  
Your smile is the gold that leads it  
Your kiss is the coal that feeds it  
  
And keeps me yearning yearning it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
We've got a lovely furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
'Cause we got a knocked out furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it won't cool off  
Burning burning and it won't cool off

Why do I tell myself these things that happen  
Are all really true  
When in my heart I know  
The magic is my love for you  
  
You sign the song begins  
You speak and I hear violins, it's magic  
The stars, desert the skies  
And rush to nestle in your eyes, it's magic  
  
Without a golden wand or mystic charms  
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms  
  
When we walk hand in hand  
The world becomes a wonderland, it's magic  
How else can I explain those rainbows  
When there ain't no rain, it's magic  
  
Why do I tell me myself  
These things that happen are all really true  
When in my heart  
I know the magic is my love for you  
  
Magic, magic, magic, magic

The snow is snowing and the wind it is blowing  
But I can weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I cannot remember the worst December  
  
Just watch the icicles form  
What do I care if icicles form  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
Off with my overcoat off with my gloves  
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love  
My heart's on fire and the flame grows higher  
  
So I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I thought you ought to know my heart's on fire  
The flame it just leaps higher  
So I will weather the storm  
Why do I care how much it storms  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm  
I've got my love to keep me warm

I've grown accustomed to her face  
She almost makes the day begin  
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon  
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I was serenely independent and content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again and yet  
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice  
Accustomed to her face  
  
She's second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet  
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air  
Accustomed to her face

Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
That's where I long to be  
In a little brown shack in South Carolina  
Someone waits for me  
In each letter she says that the weather is fine and the folks are feeling
great  
That the garden looks grand and the red rose vine is clinging to the gate  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
That's where my thoughts all stray  
To the one I love best in South Carolina  
I'm going back some day  
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
I'll find paradise  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
That's where my thoughts all stray  
To the one I love best in South Carolina  
I'm going back some day  
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
I'll find paradise

In the movie "Bells Are Ringing"  
You gotta do you gotta do it gotta do it all alone  
No one else will do it for you you're on your own  
Do it  
It may be love or war or mopping up the floor but just do it  
Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll rue it  
Do it yourself  
Don't fake it  
If you're a fake you won't make it  
Wait for your break and then take it  
For time and tide they wait for no man go go go man  
Do it  
To prove a point at hand just look at old Miles Standish who blew it  
He said John Alden will you go ask Priscilla to do it  
Miles got the heave ho  
Man  
Priscilla said that Miles is gone speak for yourself John  
He blew it so do it do it do it yourself  
  
  
  

Love me love me say you love me  
Just for fun  
Softly sigh it try it try it  
Just for fun  
If you're close to me maybe you'll agree  
Here at hand that magic land we're seeking constantly  
Tingle tingle when we mingle  
Just for fun  
Let's pretend we'll never end  
What we've begun  
For if we play at love we may stay in love  
Then you'll be glad you tried it just for fun

Just in time, I found you just in time  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed, no where to go  
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going  
  
No more doubt or fears I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lucky day  
  
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt or fears I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lucky day

Just one more chance  
To prove it's you alone I care for  
Each night I say a little prayer for  
Just one more chance  
Just one more night  
To taste the kisses that enchant me  
I'd want no others if you'd grant me  
Just one more chance  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still I'll hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still I'll hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance

Just say I love her  
I've loved her from the start  
And tell her how I'm yearning  
To say what's in my heart  
  
Just say I need her  
As roses need the rain  
And tell her that without her  
My dreams are all in vain  
  
If you should chance to meet her  
Anytime anywhere  
I was a fool to leave her  
Tell her how much a fool can care  
And if she tells you  
She's lonely now and then  
Won't you just say I love her  
And want her back again  
  
Won't you just say I love her  
And want her back again

Rooms to let, fifty cents.  
No phone, no pool, no pets  
I ain't got no cigarettes  
Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom  
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room  
I'm a man of means by no means  
King of the road.  
  
Third boxcar, midnight train  
Destination, Bangor, Maine.  
Old worn out clothes and shoes,  
I don't pay no union dues,  
I smoke old stogies I have found  
Short, but not too big around  
I'm a man of means by no means  
King of the road.  
  
I know every engineer on every train  
All of their children, and all of their names  
And every handout in every town  
And every lock that ain't locked  
When no one's around.

When I left Havana nobody saw me go  
But my little gaucho maid who loves me so  
She came down the pathway following after me  
That same little gaucho maid that I longed to see  
If at your window you see a gentle dove  
Treat it with care and welcome it there with love  
It may be so I do not deny its glee  
Crown it with flowers grant love it's hours for me  
  
Oh my darling be mine  
Won't you say that you love me  
All my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine  
  
Ah my darling be mine  
Won't you say that you love me  
Oh my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine  
  
Oh my darling be mine  
Won't you say that you love me  
All my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine

Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater  
Build me up and I'll fly  
Love me now and I'll be glad later  
And tell your trouble goodbye  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow  
Sooner better for you  
Fill it up with a happy tomorrow  
We got some living to do  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Cover me up and I'll squeeze tighter  
Honey let's kiss me do  
That good good loving makes a bad bad fighter  
And I'm not picking on you  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought me some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
And the fire is slowing dying  
And my dear we're still good-byeing  
But as long as you'd love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow and snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really grab me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Oh, the fire is slowing dying  
And my dear we're still good-byeing  
But as long as you'd love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go lover  
  
Let me be, set me free from your spell  
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
You don't want me  
  
But you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we are through  
Please turn me loose  
What's the use  
  
Let me go lover  
Let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go  
  
You don't want me  
But you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we are through  
Please turn me loose  
What's the use  
  
Let me go lover  
Let me go  
Let me go  
Let me go

Let me know the moment he lets you go  
I'll be here to welcome you to my arms yes  
I know how you feel  
After a love affair is through  
That's how I felt when you left me  
I still love you  
Let me know the moment you're feeling blue  
Come to me and I'll never let you go no  
I'll always love you can't you see dear  
Let me know the moment that you need me  
I'll always love you can't you see dear  
Let me know the moment that you need me
