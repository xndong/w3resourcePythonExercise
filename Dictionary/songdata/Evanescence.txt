Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me  
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free  
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you  
And at sweet night, you are my own  
Take my hand  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name  
  
I have dreamt of a place for you and I  
No one knows who we are there  
All I want is to give my life only to you  
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore  
Let's run away, I'll take you there  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where no one needs a reason  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Don't look back you're safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No one's left to stop you  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Don't look back you're safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No one's left to stop you now  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name

I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll  
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds  
But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to  
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved  
And I  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me  
  
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins  
I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed  
I can't go on like this  
I loathe all I've become  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me  
  
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more  
I have grown so weary of this lie I live  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me

Seether:  
I wanted you to know that  
I love the way you laugh  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away...  
I keep your photograph and  
I know it serves me well  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away  
  
You've gone away, you don't feel me here, anymore  
  
Amy Lee:  
The worst is over now  
And we can breathe again  
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away  
There's so much left to learn  
And no one left to fight  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm open  
And I don't feel like I am strong enough  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm open  
And I don't feel like I am strong enough  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away...  
  
Cause I'm Broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone...  
You gone away, you don't feel me here anymore

Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Should I let you fall, lose it all  
So maybe you can remember yourself?  
Can't keep believing  
We're only deceiving ourselves  
And I'm sick of the lie  
And you're too late  
  
Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame  
Must be exhausting to lose your own game, selfishly hated  
No wonder you're jaded  
You can't play the victim this time  
And you're too late  
  
Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
You never call me when you're sober  
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over  
  
How could I have burned paradise?  
How could I?  
You were never mine!  
  
So don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
Don't lie to me, just get your things  
I've made up your mind!

If you want to live, let live  
If you want to go, let go  
I'm not afraid to dream to sleep, sleep forever  
  
I don't need to touch the sky  
I just want to feel that high  
And you refuse to lift me  
  
Guess it wasn't real after all  
Guess it wasn't real all along  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
It's where I belong  
  
If you want to live, let live  
If you want to go, let go  
I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender  
  
Guess it wasn't real after all  
Guess it wasn't real all along  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
No light to lead the way  
Remember that all alone  
Is where I belong  
  
In a dream  
Will you give your love to me  
Beg my broken heart to beat  
Save my life, change my mind?  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
No light to lead the way  
Remember that all alone  
Is where I belong

Please don't ask me how  
I ended up at my wits end and breaking down  
Pages torn from books we never read  
Because we're plugged into this grid  
Don't pull this plug right now or then we'd really have to live  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
Your words won't save me now  
I'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow  
Get a grip on yourself is what they say  
Every hour every day  
Hands over my ears, I've been screaming all these years  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
We came in search of answers  
We left empty handed again  
Shots fired into the sky are now returning  
Where the fuck will you hide?  
  
Hiding from the laughter in the closet of our lives  
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light  
And now a hand's extending outward, quiet comfort they invite  
Do we dare take what they offer, do we step into the light?  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive

It's too late to change your mind  
Even though this fragile world  
Is tearing apart at the seams  
We can't wash these sins away  
This sinking feeling everyday  
I'm waking up in someone else's life  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
'Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
Not gonna let this day go by  
I'm gonna save this wasted life  
And nothing can stand in my way  
Not enough to say goodbye  
Burn it til there's nothing left  
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
'Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
The water's rising around us  
There is no other way down  
I only have myself to blame for it all  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
If I could just erase my mind  
But I cannot erase this lie

Give me a reason to believe that you're gone  
I see your shadow so I know they're all wrong  
Moonlight on the soft brown earth  
It leads me to where you lay  
They took you away from me but now I'm taking you home  
  
[Chorus]  
I will stay forever here with you  
My love  
The softly spoken words you gave me  
Even in death our love goes on  
  
Some say I'm crazy for my love, oh my love  
But no bonds can hold me from your side, oh my love  
They don't know you can't leave me  
They don't hear you singing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I can't love you, anymore than I do

Perfect by nature  
Icons of self indulgence  
Just what we all need  
More lies about a world that  
  
Never was and never will be  
Have you no shame don't you see me  
You know you've got everybody fooled  
  
Look here she comes now  
Bow down and stare in wonder  
Oh how we love you  
No flaws when you're pretending  
But now I know she  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you've got everybody fooled  
  
Without the mask where will you hide  
Can't find yourself lost in your lie  
  
I know the truth now  
I know who you are  
And I don't love you anymore  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you have everybody fooled  
  
It never was and never will be  
You're not real and you can't save me  
Somehow now you're everybody's fool

Fall Into You  
David Hodges feat. Amy Lee  
  
Seems so far  
That I have gone down this road  
Only to find that it ends  
But lookin' back  
There is one thing that I know  
I can't make it all alone again  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
But all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
So lead me  
Guide me  
Hold me  
Hide me in love  
With all that you are  
And all that you do  
  
Hear me  
Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh God  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall Into you  
  
Just catch me as I fall  
But all this time  
I have felt so alone  
Losing myself in my despair  
With loving arms  
You were waiting for me to let go  
With every step  
You were there  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
When all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh my child  
How I have longed  
For you to come home  
To where you belong  
All of your life  
If you could just see  
All of my joy  
When you are here with me (X2)  
  
Hear me Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh god  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall into you

I still remember the world  
From the eyes of a child  
Slowly those feelings  
Were clouded by what I know now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
An uneven trade for the real world  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all  
  
I still remember the sun  
Always warm on my back  
Somehow it seems colder now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything

Why do you cry for me?  
Why do you fake that you don't see me?  
When you change everybody's path  
But you know that...  
One day you are going to see me with different eyes  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
If I die, the love that I feel for you will ressucitateme from  
The gray of the evil and dark  
And the sun will shine for me again, yeah  
The love is indestructible against the evil  
I dream that I have you with me  
So tell me why do you cry for me?  
Come with me, you won't regret it  
  
Chorus:  
  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the death  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
(Repeat chorus 2x)

I wanted you to be with me  
For so long I don't even know by now  
But now that I've given up on you  
Defiantly you see me  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you  
  
There's something very wrong about this  
I think you knew all along somehow  
You'll only take me to change my mind  
Lonely, broken, and defeated  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
(I see through you)  
Now that I know the way you play  
I don't want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
(I see through you)  
Now that I know the way you play  
I don't want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you

I've been watching you from a distance  
That distance sees through your disguise  
All I want from you is your hurting  
I want to heal you  
I want to save you from the dark  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Why should I care if they hurt you  
Somehow it matters more to me  
Than if I were hurting myself  
Save you (save you)  
I'll save you  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
I'll have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
I'll have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness

Now I will tell you what I've done for you  
Fifty thousand tears I've cried  
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you  
And you still won't hear me  
  
(I'm going under)  
  
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself  
Maybe I'll wake up for once  
Not tormented daily defeated by you  
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom  
I'm dying again  
  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm going under  
  
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies  
So I don't know what's real and what's not  
Always confusing the thoughts in my head  
So I can't trust myself anymore  
I'm dying again  
  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm  
  
So go on and scream  
Scream at me I'm so far away  
I won't be broken again  
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under  
  
I'm dying again  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm going under  
Going under  
I'm going under

Under your spell again  
I can't say no to you  
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand  
I can't say no to you  
  
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly  
Now I can't let go of this dream  
I can't breathe but I feel  
  
Good enough  
I feel good enough for you  
  
Drink up sweet decadence  
I can't say no to you  
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind  
I can't say no to you  
  
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely  
Now I can't let go of this dream  
Can't believe that I feel  
  
Good enough  
I feel good enough  
It's been such a long time coming  
But I feel good  
  
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall  
Pour real life down on me  
'Cause I can't hold on to anything  
  
This good enough  
Am I good enough  
For you to love me too?  
  
So take care what you ask of me  
'Cause I can't say no

Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit.  
There isn't any other stair quite like it.  
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top.  
So this is the stair where I always stop.  
  
Halfway up the stairs isn't up and isn't down.  
It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town.  
And all sorts of funny thoughts run round my head.  
It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead.  
  
Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit.  
There isn't any other stair quite like it.  
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top.  
So this is the stair where I always stop.

Long lost words whisper slowly to me  
Still can't find what keeps me here  
When all this time I've been so hollow inside  
I know you're still there  
  
Watching me wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you loving you  
I won't let you pull me down  
  
Hunting you I can smell you - alive  
Your heart pounding in my head  
  
Watching me wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Saving me raping me  
Watching me  
  
Watching me, wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you, loving you  
I won't let you pull me down

Way down  
I've been way down  
Underneath this skin  
Waiting to hear my name again  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
If I hear them calling  
And nothing can hold me  
  
Way down (Do you really want me?)  
All the way down (Do you really want me?)  
I will hear your voice (Do you really want me?)  
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me)  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling  
  
I was looking to the sky  
When I knew I'd be swimming home  
And I cannot betray my kind  
They are here, it's my time  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me (Do you really want me?)  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling, (calling)  
And nothing can hold me

You don't remember me, but I remember you  
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you  
But who can decide what they dream?  
And dream I do  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
Have you forgotten all I know  
And all we had?  
You saw me mourning my love for you  
And touched my hand  
I knew you loved me then  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I look in the mirror and see your face  
If I look deep enough  
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
You're taking over me

Nobody on the road  
Nobody on the beach  
I feel it in the air  
The summer's out of reach  
Empty lake, empty streets  
The sun goes down alone  
I'm drivin' by your house  
Though I know you're not at home  
  
But I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I never will forget those nights  
I wonder if it was a dream  
Remember how you made me crazy?  
Remember how I made you scream  
Now I don't understand what happened to our love  
But babe, I'm gonna get you back  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
Out on the road today, I saw a black flag sticker on a Cadillac  
A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You cannever look back."  
I thought I knew what love was  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever  
I should just let them go but  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone

Make me whole again, open your eyes  
Taunted by the shadows of your lie  
Cold and far away like you're not even mine  
Undo everything and take me higher  
Never believing what they say 'cause I'm  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I'm not giving in, I want you back  
Holding together by the shards of our past  
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go  
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below  
Over and over in my mind  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I am so lost without my place inside your heart  
I won't survive I need to know you hear me  
Awaken and release my love  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home

Its just the way it is  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
No body can change  
  
You come around, every day  
Trying to get in my way  
I want you go get away  
Its just not the same old game  
Its not just the same old thing  
The same old relationship  
That had the same old thing  
  
  
Its just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
Its been years, it's been hours  
Many days I can't seem to remember  
I thought this was forever  
But it just can't be,  
The only things that don't last forever  
Are just you and me.  
  
It's just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
  
  
Guess it wasn't forever  
It's just the way it is  
The way it is,  
Way it is,  
Way it is.

All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumping through the pages of my fantasies  
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  
I'll see you try to take a swing at me  
Come on, gonna put on the ground, ground, ground  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies  
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown  
I'll kill and rape you the way you raped me  
And I'll pull the trigger  
And you're down, down, down  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? what the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying while you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
All my friends are gone,  
They died  
They all screamed, and cried  
I'm gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down and  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will no be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming

I tried to kill the pain  
But only brought more  
(So much more)  
I lay dying  
And I'm pouring, crimson regret, and betrayal  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
Do you remember me?  
Lost for so long  
Will you be on the other side?  
Will you forget me?  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
(Return to me salvation)  
(I want to die!)  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
My wounds cry for the grave  
My soul cries, for deliverance  
Will I be denied?  
Christ! Tourniquet! My suicide

"You hold the answer deep within your own mind  
Consciously, you've forgotten it  
That's the way the human mind works  
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful  
For us to entertain, we reject it  
We erase it from our memory  
But the imprint is always there"  
  
(Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't cry it all away)  
  
The pain that grips you  
The fear that binds you  
Releases life in me  
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes  
To blind them from the truth that finds a way from who we are  
  
Please don't be afraid  
When the darkness fades away  
The dawn will break the silence screaming in our hearts  
My love for you still grows  
This I do for you  
Before I try to fight the truth my final time  
  
"We're supposed to try and be real  
And I feel alone, and we're not together  
And that is real"  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Lying beside you  
Listening to you breathe  
The life that flows inside of you  
Burns inside of me  
Hold and speak to me  
Of love without a sound  
Tell me you will live through this  
And I will die for you  
Cast me not away  
Say you'll be with me  
For I know I cannot bear it all alone  
  
"You're not alone, honey  
Never, never"  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
It just won't fade away  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
Oh, it all away  
Oh, it all away  
  
"But the imprint is always there  
Nothing is ever really forgotten"  
  
"God, please, don't hate me  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
  
Because I'll die if you do"

Feels like the weight of the world  
Like God in heaven gave me a turn  
Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you  
Still in the dark, can you fix me?  
  
Free fall, free fall, all through life  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be  
She's nothing to me  
  
Feels like the weight of the world  
Like all my screaming has gone unheard  
And oh, I know you don't believe in me  
Safe in the dark, how can you see?  
  
Free fall, free fall, all through life  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I was  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be

You're too important for anyone  
There's something wrong with everything you see  
But I, I know who you really are  
You're the one who cries when you're alone  
  
[Chorus]  
But where will you go  
With no one left to save you from yourself  
You can't escape  
You can't escape  
  
You think that I can't see right through your eyes  
Scared to death to face reality  
No one seems to hear your hidden cries  
You're left to face yourself alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I realize you're afraid  
But you can't abandon everyone  
You can't escape  
You don't want to escape  
  
I'm so sick of speaking words that no one understands  
Is it clear enough that you can't live your whole life all alone  
I can hear you in a whisper  
But you can't even hear me screaming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I realize you're afraid  
But you can't reject the whole world  
You can't escape  
You won't escape  
You can't escape  
You don't want to escape
