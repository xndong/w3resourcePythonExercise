If I seem a bit crazy  
It's because these thoughts they crowd my mind  
Gets a little bit hazy  
These events distort my sense of time  
My heart's like a cave where the sun  
The sun refuse to shine  
  
Well, it's bleeding me dry  
It's a little like an ancient remedy  
Nowhere left to hide  
Leeching all my energy  
My thoughts turn to death  
When I'm in your company  
  
It used to be that our planets  
Were so perfectly aligned in our time  
If you could see that, now it's harder to bring back  
All your dreams and all you've left way behind  
  
there's been a subtle shift  
In the population's hearts and minds  
Is there something I missed'  
Something kinda hard to define  
Now we search for evidence  
Of the stranger in our midst  
  
It used to be that our planets  
Were so perfectly aligned in our time

Look in the mirror, and what do you see?  
Reflections of a person that used to be.  
You're running 'round town, creating bad debts -  
Let's face it, baby, your life is a mess.  
You're driving fast now, and speeding again -  
That'll never help you ease the pain.  
There's nothing in a bottle you can take from the shelf  
That'll bring you back to earth, 'cause you need help.  
  
The angels have mercy on you,  
But they can't stop you doing what you wanna do.  
May the angels have mercy on you -  
I'm gonna help you pull through.  
Now you're headed down a one-way street -  
Let the needle return.  
I've been there. who you meet?  
Watch out, you're gonna get burned.  
You can't blame me for the mess you're in -  
All your life you've been fooling yourself.  
I'll help you if I can -  
You know I'll be there.  
Life's too sweet to show this lack of care.  
  
The angels have mercy on you,  
But they can't stop you doing what you wanna do.  
May the angels have mercy on you -  
I'm gonna help you pull through.  
  
Take a look, a look at yourself. (three times)  
As the angels have mercy on you!  

No smoke without fire  
When will you ever learn  
That's what you said to me  
Bigger the head that turns,  
I say, maybe he's happy  
So quick to fire, never a liar in honesty  
It's hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony  
Could he be in love again?  
You know that she's got the touch  
The thing is we're just good friends  
Smoke without fire don't mean too much  
Your trigger finger's itching on your loaded tongue  
But it's hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony  

You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Nothing was said, but it was understood.  
I never doubted that you'd care.  
Another time, another memory,  
Like the light from a burning star.  
Another time you will come back to me  
Like a messenger from afar.  
Now the storm breaks without a warning,  
With no time for us to prepare.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.  
Oh, the prophecy  
Of what it's gonna be  
For you and me,  
Oh, forgive me if I wander  
From the path that we were on.  
You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.  

No smoke without fire  
If the sky was light  
And the moon shine brightly  
Then we?d be away tonight  
Better chance be taken  
Than love forsaken  
This ain't no mistake that I'm making.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.  
  
Well I was hoping to make it  
Sometimes you put it together  
Before you try  
Let it take it?s course,  
Because you just can't force it  
And I don't want to break down and cry.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.

Well, I been away,  
I said I been away for so long.  
Tell me, have you,  
Have you done me wrong?  
Can I tell by the look that's in your eyes,  
Have you kept your loving locked away inside?  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
I done time, I got carried away,  
I done laid this high-class babe out in the hay,  
Spent half a year in the jailhouse all alone -  
This never would have happened if I'd stayed at home, oh no.  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
Come on everybody, then, clap your hands in the air.  
Come on, a little bit louder, a little bit louder,  
Come on everybody. I'll teach you, come on,  
We want to hear you. louder, louder!  
We want you all to join in with us -  
When we say "yeah", when we say "yeah",  
We want you to say "yeah". you got it?  
Come on, are you ready? can't hear you!  
That's better, here we go.  
  
Say yeah, yeah  
Say yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Can you shake the dust, can you shake the dust,  
Can you make me shine?  
Can you shake the dust and make me shine  
Like they do in sheffield all the time?  
Been everywhere around the world,  
Seen every, every kind of girl, yeah.  
But it moves me the way that I think I know,  
And it weakens me, so make your loving flow.  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues.  

I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her.  
Her hair was golden brown  
Blowin' free like a cornfield.  
  
She was far away  
I found it hard to reach her.  
She told me you can try  
But it's impossible to find her.  
  
In my dreams everything was all right  
In your schemes you can only try.  
  
I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her.  
Her hair was golden brown Yea  
Blowin' free like a cornfield.

I don't care about no curfew tonight -  
I just come of age, my car is stood outside.  
Got my wings and I'm looking for a place to roost -  
Cruise with the boys, catch anything on the loose.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I'm going to accelerate in some old fatty bar, yes sir,  
If I hit the deck, just pick me up for some more.  
Going to look around 'till the first girl smiles at me,  
And on the way home I'll check out her i.d.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
I'm going to write my graffiti on the wall -  
Paint this town like it's never been done before.  
The way I feel, there's nothing I can't do,  
So hold on, baby, I'm coming straight on through.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
Running wild with the pack, ace up my sleeve,  
Got a taste of your love, and it's blinding me.  
Can't see straight, that's for sure.  
Me, I'm knocking on your pearly door.  
Going down the road, and my tail lights glow...  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love at first sight.  
I can't fight love,  
I can't fight love.  
Don't want to fight your love,  
Can't fight love.  
Don't want to fight your love,  
Can't fight love.  
Got to give it to me now.  
Can't fight love.  
I can't fight your love.  

Isadora  
Dancing  
Can you see her?  
Che guavara  
Marching beside her  
Valentino  
Loving every minute?  
Don't you see them looking  
Looking down on you?  
Pictures on the walls of your room  
Gonna help you play the parts  
Of your ever changing mood.  
Lying low  
The cast is set around your bones  
When all you ever wanted to be  
Was plain mister jones.  
Cell of fame  
It's gonna trap you forever.  
Self confessions  
And your back's against the wall.  
Idolized by the hands that hold the key  
Not even time will set you free.  
When it's your turn to leave  
Hung at dawn  
Then you will join up  
With the faces looking on  
That's where you belong.  
Cell of fame  
It's gonna trap you forever.  
Self confessions  
And your back's against the wall.  

I had troubles aplenty,  
My pockets were empty  
From livin' out on the sidewalk.  
Footsteps takin' me nowhere,  
But where can you go when you don't know  
What it is you're lookin' for?  
Just as I was a desperate man  
You made the sun start to shine,  
You said,"baby, come in from the rain".  
You could see down the stitches and patches  
That were holdin' me together,  
So with stolen faces, hand in hand,  
We made footsteps together for musicland.  
Used to be I had troubles aplenty,  
My pockets were empty, yeah,  
From the bad life on the back streets.  
But when your footsteps are takin' you nowhere  
Where can you go and what can you do  
When you don't know what you're lookin' for?  
Hey, just as I reached the real world  
You made the sun start to shine,  
You said,"baby, come in out of the rain".  
Oh, yeah, I said you made the sun start to shine,  
Oh, baby, come in from the rain.  

Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted,  
All day long I'm walkin', 'cause I can't get my car started.  
Laid off from my job, and I can't afford to check it -  
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it!  
Come on! I can't get started,  
Come on! since me and my baby parted,  
Come on! I can't afford to check it,  
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it!  
Come on!  
  
Everything is wrong, since I've been without you.  
Every night I lie awake, thinking about you.  
Every time the phone rings, it sounds like thunder -  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number!  
  
Come on! since I've been without you,  
Come on! steady thinkin' about you,  
Come on! phone sounds like thunder -  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number!  
Come on!  
  
Now everything is wrong since I last saw you baby,  
I really want to see you, and I don't mean maybe.  
I'm doin' everything to try to make you see  
That I belong to you, and you belong to me.  
  
Come on! I want to see you baby,  
Come on! I don't mean maybe.  
Come on! I'm tryin' to make you see  
That I belong to you, and you belong to me!  
Come on!  
  
Come on, come on, come on.....

Go ahead and cry and weep and moan -  
You know the blame is all your own.  
You paid your money and you made a choice.  
A world out there's waiting to be shown.  
Stuck in conformity, something wrong with that.  
Searching for sanity, I'm not falling in that trap.  
The way you're going, you'll travel alone  
'cause I'll never stay in the comfort zone.  
You didn't roll the dice, you didn't take the shot,  
You're all wrapped up in what you got.  
You're crying about the way you feel  
To the music of your spinning wheels.  

As the dealer dealt the cards to everyone,  
I could see that I was free.  
I had an ace of hearts, the dream of every man,  
And I could see my destiny.  
I can not justify the way I play,  
But only see them as they fall.  
  
The diamond jack  
Black magical lady luck,  
Who will show me the way.  
When you have your freedom  
Without worldly care,  
Around human share.  
Along the way there's evil waitin' for you,  
And there's no judge and jury, but yourself.  
When you're tired to the bone  
Remembrance gone,  
And you have cast your dice,  
Take your chances as they come, one by one,  
The hand of fate is as cold as ice.

Doctor can you help me please  
I'm laying on the floor  
I need a glass of something  
Like you gave me once before  
I'll send my little messenger  
He'll bring the money to you  
He'll slowly make his way back home  
There'll be no horror show today my friends  
And me well be up and get away  
CHORUS:  
If I fill your every need  
You won't feel so empty  
In my web I'll bet your life  
You're dead before you're thirty  
Doctor can you help me please  
I trust you like my mum  
I know that you won't stop me turning  
All the whole world on  
You know that I'll always come to you  
When everything goes wrong  
You pick me up, don't let me go down  
To the horror show today my friend  
And me well be up and get away  

Weaving a web around my heart,  
Slowly taking my world apart.  
I can't begin to think of anything else  
Left my reason way up on a shelf.  
Stealing away without a sound,  
My feet don't hardly touch the ground.  
I look at the clock, the hands of fate,  
The train I'm riding can't be late.  
Riding on that dream train -  
One look in your eyes, and I follow through.  
Riding on that dream train -  
Been a rider since I met you.  
The brush of her skirt, the look in her eye  
No use denying the curve of her thigh.  
I got a feeling I'm out on limb  
Past committing original sin.  
Cold steel on a railroad track  
Hard heart, I ain't coming back.  
Put the border on red alert  
Heed the warning, you're gonna get hurt.  

Picked up my baby before the sun set -  
She's always ready to step inside.  
I can't wait, though, to get started,  
And her love is so bona fide.  
I'm in the mood for it, I'm in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love.  
Yeah, my serenity, her intentions -  
And we were rolling on down that road.  
She was tuned to, to perfection -  
I was heading for that overload.  
I'm in the mood for it, I'm in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love.  
It makes my engine overheat,  
Puts me back into the seat,  
It's just the nature, just the nature,  
That makes my engine overheat.  
Twin barrels burning, just like a rocket -  
She took me faster than I've ever been.  
There was nothing I could do, and I didn't ask for something  
Like sitting on a guillotine. you know just what I mean.  
I'm in the mood for it, right in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love, your love, your love.  
It makes my engine overheat -  
Puts me back into the seat,  
It's just the nature, it's just the nature of the beast.  
Just the nature, just the nature,  
Makes my engine overheat.  

I didn't know what day it was that day,  
Felt just like falling down on my knees to pray.  
Looked at myself, and all that I could say  
Was,"I think I see the errors of my way".  
  
There in the glass there was something caught my eye,  
Although I try through my sighing not to cry.  
See where I am, and what I try to say,  
Just so I'll look at the errors of my way.  
  
Guess I got no one around to pull me through.  
I just need someone to turn to, yes, I do.  
Doin' my best just to change my yesterday,  
Then I won't have no more errors of my way.

Trust in me, I'll try to do  
Everything to help you that I can  
Broken wings can heal and mend again  
Don't be afraid to cry your tears out loud  
Everybody needs to have a friend  
  
It's only love that I can give  
And I give to you the only love I have  
When I see you're so unhappy  
It makes me want to try and understand  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
  
If everything should turn around  
And it's me who feels so down and out  
You could be the kind of company  
To share a load and know how bad it feels  
Everybody needs to have a friend

Mother 's first look to the eyes of a child  
Casts the die of destiny  
It's a perfect life she gives to you  
Not to lose so innocently  
Leading the way, she rises above  
Unexpected adversity  
I hear her calling, keeper of the light  
The words of warning, thunder in the night  
I hear her calling, guarding what is right  
I see her waiting, keeper of the light  
  
A silhouette on the skyline, a symbol of your liberty  
Protecting time that's passing by  
Mother knows, never lies  
A better life the children will see  
A world of change, full of hope and sympathy  
  
I hear her calling, keeper of the light  
The words of warning, thunder in the night  
I hear her calling, guarding what is right  
I see her waiting, keeper of the light  
  
Repeat

The wind was howling,  
Dogs were sleeping,  
I had to bite my tongue.  
Looking down the street,  
I was hanging on  
Eighty floors above the ground,  
Suffering vertigo.  
Got me a date with a drug store blond,  
With a cure I know  
She picks me up when I'm coming down.  
Kicks on the street  
It's a shot in the arm.  
Get your kicks on the street  
Can't do any harm.  
Can't put me on a drip feed,  
Under state control.  
I put a razor to my face,  
And the steel is cold.  
It ain't going to take me too long before I get revived.  
I'm traveling incognito,  
Don't want to be identified.  
They dress you up,  
They strip you down.  
Ain't going to find me falling asleep behind the driver's wheel.  
You get me intoxicated,  
That's the way I feel.  
I can't break the ice,  
Shrinks in the heat,  
Falling like an acrobat and landing on my feet.  
She picks me up when I'm coming down.  

Hear me when I cry,  
Listen to my song  
The jay, my lovely lady,  
To the earth she did belong.  
I can't trace her,  
Lost her from my life,  
But the manor lady's bright young son  
Can take her for his wife.  
Under the forest branches  
She came to me,  
Until the day she cried aloud  
A father I should be.  
That was the last time that we met,  
I never saw her again,  
For she took her life on princeton wharf  
To save my worthy name.  
She found death's open arms  
And lay in them in grace  
I watched as icy fingers  
Clawed her lovely face.  
Now I stumble through the mist  
To where they laid her in the grave,  
And maybe I'll remember  
The flowers for my days.  
Far beyond the sand  
I will take your hand,  
The spirit of our love will live forever.  
Far beyond the clouds  
We will laugh aloud,  
The spirit of our love will live again.  

Lady Whiskey, such a sad sight, stumblin' as she walks.  
She even hates herself sometimes.  
Keep her clear, for it's Saturday night.  
  
Drowns her sorrow, eases her pain,  
Waits for tomorrow, when she'll do the same again.  
  
Lady Whiskey's got a man, her man is just like her  
Tries to fit the key in the door  
When he comes home Saturday night.  
  
Drowns his sorrow, eases his pain,  
Waits for tomorrow, when he'll do the same again.  
  
Lady Whiskey's got a son, got a daughter, too.  
Son don't play, but the daughter's on the way  
When she comes home Saturday night.  
  
Lady Whiskey, she gets sick when she goes downtown.  
One day drink's gonna put her down  
She won't come home Saturday night.

Has anybody seen my baby kickin' around the town?  
She's the queen of torture, yeah,  
She, yeah, you know she put me down.  
She, yeah, you know she put me down.  
  
Has anybody seen my woman hangin' round the streets?  
She ain't been home for oh, so long  
She walked right out on me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Has anybody seen my woman out around the city?  
She ain't been home for two weeks now,  
And ain't that such a pity, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm amazed at the way you do,  
You do the things that they want you to.  
Can't you see there's a turning tide?  
It's going to turn into a landslide.  
The ground will fall from your feet,  
You got to do before you feel the heat.  
It's "heads I win, tails you lose" -  
There's no escaping any way you chose.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Something's blowing up in the air.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
There's a rainstorm coming, beware.  
Oh, it's a tragedy it had to come to this.  
There's no way out, so don't you try to resist.  
The thunder cloud hanging overhead,  
It's going to break and cause a landslide.  

I can't tell you, mother, why I feel this way.  
People passing through my life, I let them slip away.  
Standing in the bright light, let the music play.  
Better in the spotlight  
You gotta turn my night to day.  
Lead me to the water  
You can't make me drink.  
Dressed like a renegade, faster than you think.  
Can't put down these feelings rising to the boil,  
Colours of a rattlesnake, ready to uncoil.  
Better by far this way.  
Turn, I want you to turn,  
Turn my night to day.  
You yourself set me on this course when I was a child,  
Walking down these men streets like a boy gone wild,  
Programmed for survival.  
All will be revealed.  
The child is father to the man  
I guess my fate is sealed.  
Better by far this way.  
Burn my blues,  
Burn my blues away,  
Like a renegade.  

Last night i had a dream  
A vision in the dark,  
I found that i had been across the desert space,  
Saw all the people behind a naked face.  
  
I held out my hand,  
Hoping you'd be there.  
I could not understand all the reasons why  
Faces from the past looking me in the eye.  
  
Now the light has come  
Breaking form the east  
Someday we can find somewhere  
To rest in peace.  
  
I lost my control,  
In a nightmare of being  
Just a lonely soul  
Without a hanging cross,  
Standing all alone  
Watching the lightning flash.

Like to have you 'round  
With all the lies that you make  
The things or darkness and you  
Some people say, have just a taste  
Right or wrong, you might get burned  
What you gain is what you learn  
  
Got one too many women  
Don't know quite which way to go  
They're all gettin' so expensive  
When they walk by themselves  
Right or wrong, don't regret  
What you went for is what you get  
  
No point in bitter tears  
When someone else has cut you down  
'Cause there's a time for leavin'  
And there's a time for stickin' around, hey  
Right or wrong, you've got to live  
So what you collect is what you give
