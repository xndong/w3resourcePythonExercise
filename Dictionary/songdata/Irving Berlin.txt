Frank butler:  
The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns  
The roustabouts that move the show at dawn  
  
Annie oakley:  
The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns  
Your baggage with the labels pasted on  
  
Frank butler:  
The sawdust and the horses and the smell  
  
Annie oakley:  
The towel you've taken from the last hotel  
  
Annie oakley, frank butler and chorus:  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything the traffic will allow  
No where could you have that happy feeling  
When you aren't stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack o' gold  
Let's go on with the show  
Let's go on with the show!  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler:  
They say that falling in love is wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they say.  
And with a moon up above it's wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they tell me.  
  
Annie oakley:  
I can't recall who said it  
  
Frank butler:  
I know I never read it  
I only know that falling in love is grand  
  
And to hold a girl in your arms  
Is wonderful,  
  
Annie oakley:  
Wonderful...  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler:  
In every way  
So they say

Get thee behind me, satan  
I want to resist  
But the moon is low and I can't say "no"  
Get thee behind me  
  
Get thee behind me, satan  
I mustn't be kissed  
But the moon is low and I may let go  
Get thee behind me  
  
Someone I'm mad about  
Is waiting in the night for me  
Someone that I mustn't see  
Satan, get thee behind me  
  
He promised to wait  
But I won't appear and he may come here  
Satan, he's at my gate  
Get thee behind me  
Stay where you are  
It's too late

While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,  
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.  
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,  
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer:  
  
God bless America, land that I love,  
Stand beside her and guide her  
Through the night with a light from above.  
From the mountains, to the prairies,  
To the oceans white with foam,  
God bless America,  
My home sweet home.

We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The temperature's rising,  
It isn't surprising,  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
She started a heat wave  
By letting her seat wave  
In such a way that  
The customers say that  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
Gee, her anatomy  
Makes the mercury  
Jump to ninety-three.  
  
We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The way that she moves  
That thermometer proves  
That she certainly can can-can.

[1st verse:]  
Too long I held you close to my heart  
Too much I loved you right from the start  
Too soon you vanished out of my dreams  
Too late to start all over it seems  
[Refrain:]  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me?  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But how about me?  
You'll find somebody new  
But what am I to do?  
I'll still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
[2nd verse:]  
Moonlight was beaming down from the skies  
Lovelight was gleaming deep in your eyes  
Sunlight for just a moment and then  
Twilight and I was lonely again  
[Alternate line:]  
Will tell the world about you

How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
  
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
  
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
How high is the sky?

Don't ask me just how it happened  
I wish I knew  
I can't believe that it's happened  
And still it's true  
  
I got lost in his arms, and I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms, and I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say  
"there you go, there you go"  
  
How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall  
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart as it foolishly  
Kept jumping all around  
  
I got lost  
But look what I found

Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't  
What do I find?  
The things I got will keep me satisfied  
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't  
What do I find?  
A healthy balance on the credit side  
Got no diamond  
Got no pearl  
Still I think I'm a lucky girl  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
I'm all right  
[2]  
Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no silver  
Got no gold  
What I got can't be bought or sold  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
I'm all right  
[3]  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no heirlooms  
For my kin  
Made no will but when I cash in  
I leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening they're all right

[1st verse:]  
As a child I went wild when a band played  
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed  
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply  
Divine  
But today when they play I could hiss them  
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system  
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine  
  
[chorus:]  
I love a piano, I love a piano  
I love to hear somebody play  
Upon a piano, a grand piano  
It simply carries me away  
  
I know a fine way to treat a steinway  
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories  
  
And with the pedal I love to meddle  
When padarewski comes this way  
I'm so delighted if I'm invited  
To hear that long haired genius play  
  
So you can keep your fiddle and your bow  
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh  
I love to stop right beside an upright  
Or a high toned baby grand  
  
[2nd verse:]  
When a green tetrazine starts to warble  
I grow cold as an old piece of marble  
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause  
At her best I detest the soprano  
But I run to the one at the piano  
I always love the accomp'niment and that's because

I guess there's nothing to do  
And nothing to say,  
But simply go on my way  
And call it a day.  
  
I guess I'm ready to go  
Right back on the shelf,  
Because at last I've learned  
Where you're concerned,  
I've just been fooling myself.  
  
I never had a chance,  
I thought you cared for me,  
But now I see I never had a chance.  
I never had a chance.  
Though you never told me so,  
Somehow I know I never had a chance.  
  
I knew we'd have to part,  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart.  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat.  
But more than that,  
I never had a chance.  
  
I never had a chance,  
I thought you cared for me,  
But now I see I never had a chance.  
I never had a chance.  
Though you never told me so,  
Somehow I know I never had a chance.  
  
I knew we'd have to part,  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart.  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat.  
But more than that,  
I never had a chance.

Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be color-blind  
But I met you and now I find  
There's green in the grass  
There's gold in the moon  
There's blue in the skies  
  
That semi-circle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes

TOMMY:]  
What is mine, dear, will be yours  
When the sun shines and when it pours  
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall  
Fifty-fifty in ev'rything  
Haven't got much, even that much to my name  
Fortune's door shut, can't get in, but just the same  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you  
  
My sense of humor, my disposition, my rosy future  
I'll share it all with you  
  
Someday, honey, I'll have money  
You know what that brings  
Furs and diamond rings  
And besides those things  
There'll be  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you  
  
[WINNIE:]  
My head for thinking, my face for smiling, my hands for cooking  
I'll share it all with you  
  
My understanding, my loving nature, my good intentions  
I'll share it all with you  
  
I'm not twenty but there's plenty  
Underneath my hat  
I know where I'm at  
And on top of that  
There'll be  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you

I'm honored, I'm flattered  
This greeting really mattered  
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned  
I like your attention  
But this I have to mention  
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned  
  
There's a girl in Tennessee  
Who's sorry she met up with me  
Can't go back to Tennessee  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
There's a girl in Omaha  
But I ran faster than her pa  
Can't go back to Omaha  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
There's a girl in Wyoming  
And they're combing Wyoming  
To find the man in white  
Who was out with her that night  
  
There's a girl in Arkansas  
The sheriff is her brother-in-law  
Can't go back to Arkansas  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
You're making too much fuss  
For we don't give a tinker's cuss  
We've been out, yes, each of us  
With a bad, bad man  
  
We've been chasing up and down  
That other show has just left town  
And the one who played the clown  
Was a bad, bad man  
  
You may love us and leave us  
But the parting won't grieve us  
We'll turn the other cheek  
When the minstrels come next week  
  
When the show folks come to call  
A girl may slip but she won't fall  
We'll give some but won't give all  
To a bad, bad man  
  
For years I have yearned to  
Play towns I could return to  
And "this may be it" from the way that you speak  
I'm glad you're not frightened  
The atmosphere has brightened  
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week  
  
Monday when my show is done  
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun  
You may find it lots of fun  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Tuesday there's no matinee  
But I'll be in my tent all day  
You can come around and play  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Send your mothers on Wednesday  
Because Wednesday's old hens' day  
But Thursday is sublime  
I'll have lots of open time  
  
Friday night will be the test  
If Saturday you're still my guest  
Sunday you can come and rest  
With a bad, bad man  
  
I'm enlightened but frightened  
Tho' my interest you've heightened  
It might turn out to be  
That you're much too much for me  
  
So I'll go back to my tent  
And someday when you're old and bent  
Think of hours you might have spent  
With a bad, bad man

I've been a roaming romeo  
My juliets have been many  
But now my roaming days have gone  
Too many irons in the fire  
Is worse than not having any  
I've had my share and from now on:  
  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you  
  
I'm giving all my love to one baby  
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through  
  
I've got a great big amount  
Saved up in my love account  
Honey  
And I've decided  
Love divided  
In two  
Won't do  
  
So  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting everything I've got on you  
  
[2]  
I've been a roaming juliet  
My romeos have been many  
But now my roaming days have gone  
Too many irons in the fire  
Is worse than not having any  
I've had my share and from now on:  
  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you  
  
I'm giving all my love to one baby  
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through  
  
I've tried to love more than one  
Finding it just can't be done  
Honey  
There's one I lie to  
When I try to  
Be true  
To two  
  
So  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting everything I've got on you

The weather is frightening.  
The thunder and lightning  
Seem to be having their way.  
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day.  
The turn in the weather  
Will keep us together  
So I can honestly say,  
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day  
And everything's okay.  
  
Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.  
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.  
  
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,  
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.  
  
I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.  
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.  
  
Let the rain pitter patter  
But it really doesn't matter  
If the skies are gray.  
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.
