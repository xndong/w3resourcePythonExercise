I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke  
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke  
I was an iron man I had a master plan  
But I was alone  
  
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind  
I remember how your body started trembling  
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in  
I'm still alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
And all the wonders made for the earth  
And all the hearts in all creation  
Somehow I always end up alone  
  
Always end up alone, always end up alone  
So I'll play, I'll wait  
'Cause you know that love takes time  
  
Living love between the line  
We came (sha la) so close (so far)  
Just the beat of a lonely heart  
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone  
  
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone  
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home  
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere  
But I'm still alone  
  
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate  
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate  
Am I the subject of the pain  
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone  
  
And is there glory there to behold  
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told  
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la  
And I pray it's not too late  
We came sha la so far so far  
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine  
And I don't want to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gone but not out of sight  
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home  
I don't want to be alone face the heat of the the night  
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone  
You search for the light  
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean  
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain  
And there's no one home

'leaving' that's all you ever seem to say and I'm tired  
The wants you have me for have expired  
Sleeping and reading every book I can find to get my mind off  
In all I was a soul you were using  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead  
  
People, the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper  
There's no one there for you to confide in  
It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on  
And to rely on  
Someone there to share and to shine on  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me down or I am dead

I've been here all your life watching your crying game  
You were the heaven in my lonely world  
And he was your sun and your rain  
I was losing you before I ever held you tight  
Before you ever held me in your arms  
And I won't make you blue  
And maybe an everlasting love will do  
  
Ah, we got an everlasting love  
So tall, so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
It's your love I need, it's the only show  
And it's you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday  
We killed the pain , we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Take me out of the cold  
Give me what I've hungered for  
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need  
Then it only makes me love you more  
I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine  
I could have saved you all the pain you knew  
And I won't make you cry  
And maybe an everlasting love can try  
  
Ah, we got an everlasting love  
So tall , so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
It's your love I need, it's the only show  
And it's you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears are yesterday  
We killed the pain, we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Ah, we got an everlasting love  
So tall , so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
It's your love I need, it's the only show

We killed the pain, we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah...  
Well, I been working up a fever trying to  
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place  
I can't contain myself anymore  
Can't you see it's written all over my face  
Why don't you get on your feet  
It's about time you got to think  
What ever happened to peace  
Well open your eyes and you'll see children laughing,  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...  
  
Your always talkin' right and talkin' about  
The world and it's corruption and moral decay  
But what you gonna do about it, nothing,  
'Cause you're more like children then children while they play  
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands  
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you  
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
You're so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know it'll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude,  
With your endless sickenin' attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Can't you see, children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
Children laughin', voices singin' hearts beatin'  
Children laughin', voices singin', (fade)

And the rain will fall, it falls for you.  
And the clouds will break into tears,  
You should be here standing so near to me.  
  
'Cept I know you should be sad  
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.  
Though say I know it's only the weather.  
'Cause every time it rains you are gone.  
And I'm blue.  
Then I wake up, then I wake up.  
  
And the sun will shine if just for you.  
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies,  
Heaven will pass to me, yeah.  
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.  
Oh! Why am I still here without you by my side.  
So I cry your name and love,  
The thought to me is back and how near.  
Then I wake up, then I grow up.  
  
And the rain will fall.  
It falls for you.  
And the clouds will break  
It should be near.  
And the sun will shine  
If just for you  
And the love

Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
The sun and the sea  
The darkness in the way  
All the pain don't get no better  
It gets stronger every day  
  
It happens to be true  
That I still pray to you my love  
Voices in the night, don't help  
My searching for the truth, my love  
  
And when I'm lost  
And high above the storm  
I hear your name  
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside  
And where are you  
  
Angela, I'm still alive  
For the two of us  
I'm still alive  
You've got to imagine us  
All the world was on our side  
We had the power of the universe  
And we were ready  
We were ready for the ride  
  
Moonlight in her hair  
Her eyes the wonder of the age  
But all I mean to you my love  
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage  
  
And through it all  
One fire in the rain  
Keeps burning on, keeps burning on  
I can't stop my heart  
It's beating for you  
Reaching for you  
But you are gone  
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside  
And where are you  
  
Angela, I'm still alive  
For the two of us  
I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive

Ooh ooh ooh  
When you wait and you watch  
And you're wishing for something wild  
I figure I can please you someday someway  
I figure I can put your love on trial  
I'm taking you back to school  
Talk about making it something real  
Nobody could deny you anything  
  
[Chorus]  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
You know I'd do anything  
Anything for you  
  
You you you  
You can run with the fun  
You can tickle my nerves inside  
In the face of heartbreak, heartache  
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride  
Better we make it soon  
Let it be the one that make you  
Cry for more  
Anyone else would buy you anything  
I'd do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything  
I'd do anything

Autumn and Friday the winds blew  
July, September, I knew you  
And now I sit on the sand hill  
I sing our song to the sea  
  
August, October  
Mid-April, November, May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry, it's curtains today  
  
In August, October the grass grew  
The sky was blue and I want you  
Now as I look out my window  
I see the world carry on  
  
August, October  
Mid-April, November, May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry, it's curtains today  
  
August, October  
Mid-April, November, May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry, it's curtains today

Took a plane to Cairo  
Then a Cessna to Rome  
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv  
And it's the first time that I've flown  
  
But I've found my Shangri-la  
In a place that's not too far, back home  
  
Took a train to Jordan  
And to Texas and back  
I met Lyndon B. Johnson and I felt his hand on my back  
  
But I found my Shangri-la  
In a place that's not too far, back home  
  
Back home, back home  
back home, back home  
back home, back home  
(repeat back home and fade)

Barker sing me a song  
Instead of counting trees,  
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker  
Live it up, shine my shoes  
  
Fly me to the moon ,  
Never before have I seen the light, Mr Barker  
Then the moment of depression fell around , Mr Barker  
And the changes of expression to a frown, My friend Barker  
  
There must be something there  
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr Barker

Be who you are  
Don't ever change  
The world was made to measure for your smile  
So smile.  
  
Those crazy dreams  
We threw, we threw away  
I never been alone with you  
I never could  
They say  
  
That love will find a way  
And love will never be set free  
I won't ever let you see  
You could not understand  
You never will  
  
Be who you are  
I bless I bless your name  
And all that summer madness caused the rain  
And we, we  
  
The glory that we made  
My love will grace the halls of time  
A love that never can be mine  
You could not love me then  
I love you still  
  
Be who you are  
Seize life and find a way  
And I will be that shadow loving who you are  
Be who you are  
We were

People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave  
Their problems in the arms of others, running to their mothers  
Lasting love is such a funny thing  
When you're in love you're on the wings  
You're not in love, it's good for you  
'cause you can do the things you want to do  
  
It's you big chance, to take it baby  
It's you big chance, you'll make it baby  
  
When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you  
You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me  
In the night is such a lonely time  
I dream of you and that's a sign  
It means that I am still a fool  
And I am still so much in love with you  
  
It's your big chance, so take it baby  
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby  
  
Big chance  
Hot chance

Birdie told me I must get over you somehow.  
And she told me never to think of you right now.  
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.  
I think about her in my time, know in my mind it's over.  
  
Looks like falling, heaven is calling my name to me.  
Funny faces loving the traces left for me.  
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.  
I think about her in my time, know in my mind it's over.

It don't matter who you are  
Anyone can be a star  
Brighter than the lightning  
You go as far as you go  
You got to be what you know  
  
There may be somebody out to get the better of you  
You need the one good woman to keep you alive  
Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head  
Remember nobody left you on the railway line  
And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time  
  
Breakout  
Ain't no one gonna break your heart  
You'll never do it if you never start  
You be there  
Breakout now  
  
You gotta be a story told  
And baby , no one gonna steal your soul  
You be there  
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight  
  
There are diamonds in the street  
But you don't get enough to eat  
Walking on a wire  
There is a future unknown  
Nobody does it alone  
  
And maybe you can be the thunder  
If you follow your dream  
There must be one good woman to show you the way  
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are  
Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line  
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time  
  
Breakout  
Ain't no one gonna break your heart  
You'll never do it if you never start  
You be there

I wasn't born in the morning, no  
I must have been born in the night  
I've done my load and I'll carry my load  
And all I own is my life  
  
I wasn't born to be lucky,  
Cause luck had no future with me  
I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song  
and stand beneath the hanging tree  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Let all the towns people see  
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head  
Just put me down and set me free  
  
I wasn't born as a rich man, no  
A rich man I never, I never could be

Green fields where we used to wander  
Purple valleys , near my home

My big teardrops, in red pastures

No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Ooh, with lips so sweet  
Our love just can't be beat, my darling, oh yeah  
A love like yours and mine  
Can stand the test of time, my darling, oh yeah  
But for tomorrow -- tomorrow never comes  
Love is the secret -- goes living on  
  
No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Just when I need you, show me the way  
You came into my world -- turned my night to day  
What good is a man without a woman?  
But for the trouble -- trouble always comes  
Love is the secret -- goes living on  
  
No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough

Keep me forever, you're my darling, oh yeah

When love is the question I've got enough

1974  
Some nights we made our love in the sand  
And at the tide we held our love in our hands  
And we listened to music the ocean was playing  
The words that our two hearts were saying  
That only two lovers can make  
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real  
  
Your the light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
And believing I have been touch by your love  
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
  
And this feeling knowing you blassed me forever  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade...

CHERRY RED  
Bee Gess  
  
Where are you  
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when we're alone  
Cherry red, my cherry red  
  
Turquoise green , greener than the deeper sea  
Greener still when she's with me  
Cherry red , my cherry red  
  
I wonder why (wonder why)  
The stars that night shine big and bright for me  
I wonder why (wonder why)  
She's true to me the way that she will always be  
  
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when we're alone  
Cherry red , my cherry red  
  
I wonder why (wonder why)

She's true to me the way that she will always be

Sweeter still when we're alone  
Cherry red, my cherry red  
  

We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating  
We are searchers of the truth, every man's a boy deep down  
Gotta say it how you mean it, there ain't no easy way  
  
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm  
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born  
To the very last day when the curtains are drawn  
We are children of the world, asking every question why  
From arrival to survival, just to make it worth the waiting  
We are faces in the night, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, there ain t no easy way  
  
In the back of your mind there is always a mark  
There's a wandering solo alone in the dark  
You can keep it forever or tear it apart  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changing my life, changing your life, keeps us all anticipating  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm  
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born  
Till the very last day when the curtains are drawn  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating

I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start  
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys in your heart  
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine  
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh, one, two, three and now there's me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on, another one  
I've got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh, one, two, three and now there's me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on , another one  
I've got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who can't be true , I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind

Many years have passed, it seems,  
And I am all alone.  
I've sent the children far away  
To some obscure unknown.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It's so sad,  
So sad.  
Close another door.  
Listen to my eyes.  
Close another door.  
You're much too old to work,  
So won't you run away?  
  
When I was young, I used to say  
That age won't bother me.  
The life I had was very sad,  
It all went out to sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though the sun is in outside,  
The rain is in my hair.  
Now my life is lived inside,  
(Now all my life is mystified)  
My home is in my chair.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me go.  
Send me flowers and  
Put me on a plane.  
I've paid before,  
  
So I've been told  
At least I'm alive  
  
I may be old but I've been told at least I'm still alive  
Fly me young, fly, and tomorrow, yeah  
Get me up  
I been working so, so very hard

I'm full of pride and my heart feels good  
Got news from my family up in the woods  
At last I can go back where I belong  
Sweated it all out for nine long years  
  
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears  
When the man saying "no hiding ,son"  
So I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then, hardly grown  
  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everybody said the kid's no good  
Come home johnny bride come home  
Johnny bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad [Repeats]

So warm is my morning sun, red is my rainbow  
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face  
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding  
Like a light in the storm  
  
Whenever I cry my friend  
You're always away and so I pretend  
If I could live the dreams that I see  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love for you  
  
My life has meaning now, I am a window  
And all things seem clear to me now  
Like a light in the storm  
  
Whenever I cry my friend  
You're always away and so I pretend  
If I could live the dreams that I see  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love for you

Country women now, what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter  
You came on like a river, doin' all the things you oughta  
You're a self made women, baby, not a made-to-order  
If you had your way , I know you'd make me stay  
And that would only bring me down  
Country women now, what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
  
Country women , country women, country women  
Country women, country women, ahh  
Country women now, what you gonna do with your life  
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
Leave my life alone  
Country women now, country women now, country women now,  
Country women now, country women now, country women now

He smiled and rubbed the stubble on his chin  
He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life that's growing thin  
Yet, he didn't have so very far to go  
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned  
With a mere step in the mountain to a light  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Even in the morning when he slept  
Something odd is missing  
There's nothing very much to talk about  
And nothing very much to see  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Talks about the place he'd like to go  
And you never see the worrying and hurrying that makes a person slow  
Yet, you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find  
Yet, he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind  
And his wavy hair continues not to grow  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice

There were the trees, see the grass, a thing gets inspired.  
Said "This is the place I will try," and he did.  
Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in,  
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did.  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes,  
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
  
Said 'Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend,  
Doesn't need any money till then" and he did .  
He said "I'm the owner,not you, and this is my stead,  
So give it to me now I'm dead, and he did , said:  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.

There she goes my daytime girl.  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground.  
  
Heaven knows my daytime girl.  
Never been kissed she don't know what she's missing.  
All the kisses there are to be found.  
All the wisdom of people she used.  
She took advantage of this.  
Taking time to remember the past.  
Remembering all she has missed.  
  
What a dream this place has been.  
Said when she left "I believed when I saw him.  
All the seeing believing come true".  
All the wisdom of people she used.  
She took advantage of this.  
Taking time to remember the past.  
Remembering all she has missed.  
  
There she goes my daytime girl.  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground.  
Me how to get over you.

I hear you calling me 'dearest' too.  
My dearest,  
I'm nearest than I've ever been before  
To have you calling me 'dearest' once more.  
  
My dearest, this picture,  
My own memory,  
Wishing this picture be reality.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
The lord took you away.  
And if you could see me today.  
I will remember you.  
I will remember you.  
  
My dearest, sincerest,  
There's no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
You're my dearest too.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
The lord took you away.  
And if you could see me today,  
I will remember you.  
I will remember you.  
  
My dearest, sincerest,  
There's no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
You're my dearest too.

Oh what a night!  
Late December back in sixty-three.  
What a very special time for me.  
I'll remember what a night.  
  
Oh what a night!  
No I didn't even know her name,  
But I'm never gonna be the same.  
What a lady, what a night!  
  
Oh I, I had a funny feeling when she walked into the room.  
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon.  
Oh what a night!  
  
Hypnotized and mesmorizing me.  
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surender, what a night!  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under,  
Oh what a night!  
  
Why'd it take so long to see the light.  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seemed so right.  
What a lady, what a night!

This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
I'm not a saint but stand accused  
You're with someone who thinks love's the same as being used  
Now suspicious minds may say, it's over, over  
Whether I live or die, you are my savior, you're my savior  
  
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu  
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you  
Sheltering arms, reach out to you  
  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
The silent nights, I cry your name  
You're with someone who says, they can get you through your pain  
These golden years keep on returning, it's hurting  
Precious and few, you're my savior, you're my savior  
  
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu  
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you  
Sheltering arms reach out to you  
  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Cherish what they've lost  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
When often it's too late  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
It's my deja vu  
(My deja vu)  
Sweet deja vu  
(Keep coming through)  
Through the feast or famine, I'll be with you  
(All that is true)  
Sheltering arms, reach out to you  
(Ooh)  
  
Oh, baby  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication

We may be big or small or black or white, eternally  
And black and white is you and me (in a special light).  
We may be young or old or in between, but this much I know  
Together we can learn to grow.  
  
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
These are the golden years we get to live, we lead the way  
tomorrow we can start today (in a special light).  
Love could be good or bad or in between, but this much I know  
Baby, you and I can learn  
  
In a world that's rearranging it's reality  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
And it's nice to light a fire when it's cold outside  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light

Hindsight, don't make it right  
She give me trouble enough  
And she's a ball of light  
I'm in the tunnel of love  
With the American dream  
And I was born too soon  
A little good luck, never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin, she got a city block  
And she was barkin' at the moon  
  
She likes to show  
So many sides to her  
And I'd be the one to know  
  
[Chorus:]  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
When am I gonna go to where you are  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong  
  
Black knight, take a bite  
She can double it up  
And she's a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin' in the fire  
White steam, never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know  
It's touchin' me or her  
  
[Chorus]

1974  
I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old  
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be  
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark  
Keeping other dogs like him for company  
  
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town  
Try to get some bread to make another way  
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow  
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day  
  
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73  
When I heard somebody call outside my door  
Said "Are you friend or are you foe"  
He looked up and he said "no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more"  
  
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
Need a friend  
Need a friend

Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me  
I keep telling my self that it's true  
I can get over anything you want my love  
But I can't get myself over you  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
Though I try to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole  
Let me try to go on living right now  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love

Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why  
But lately you don't talk to me  
Darling I can't see me in your eyes  
I hold you near but you're so far away  
And it's losing you I can't believe  
To watch you leave and let this feeling die  
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive  
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love  
You know I can't survive  
Only my love can raise you high above it all  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
(break)  
  
We can take the darkness and make if full of light  
But let your love flow back to me  
How can you leave and let this feeling die  
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other women's love could be as true, I'm begging you  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
(repeat last verse at least twice more and fade out)

I am the searcher of my fortunes  
I've got my right hand on the wheel  
We've got to dig for buried treasures  
I know exactly how i feel  
  
I went walkin'through a grave-yard  
Where the darkness is my friend  
I heard all about the beginning  
I want to see just where it ends  
  
I have fed the jaded tiger  
And every tiger knows my name  
But just as long as long as i can see my face  
I can tell myself my name  
  
Don't want to live inside myself  
I'm much better of alone  
But then you must believe in the fallin'rain  
In the morning  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Saved by the bell  
Man for all seasons

I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.  
Take it nice and easy mama , chicken on the run and I don't care.  
I'd show my body anywhere.  
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.  
Don't you think that I don't know  
it ain't been a perfect day , but I don't care.  
I'd sell my body anywhere.  
In the name of creation , I can't find an explanation anywhere.  
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.  
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.  
I'd show my feelings anywhere.  
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Down, down the road , up the road (sing 5 times)

All that I need is just a piece of paper  
Say a few lines, make up my mind  
so she can read it later, when I'm gone  
Elisa, goodbye , Elisa  
  
All that I need is just a quiet corner  
Bring to the light , things I must write  
Got to get it over with, choose  
Elisa , goodbye, Elisa  
  
The song that I sing  
The times I've tried to hide it  
I'm sorry to say, I'm going away  
That's what I've decided on  
I've tried

Goodbye Elisa

Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x4]  
  
Take this in hand  
Said he who stands  
Behind the chair  
A broken table there  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x4]  
  
Don't walk so tall  
Before you crawl  
  
For every child  
Is thinking of something wild  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x3]  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you (will show you)

There's a law in what we do  
We got a quest for something new  
Everything you witness seems to  
Let you down  
If someone gets you from behind  
I got an open mind  
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
I don't wanna mess with mother nature  
Knowing that you're mine  
You said I could see  
You with another and we all get satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
An eternal source of pleasure  
In being the one  
When your love is for the giving  
It's a case of destiny  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be commital to be a little deviation  
  
So I get all wound up inside  
I can see your scene unwind  
You dance together or you dance alone  
And leave the real world in the air  
Love it in leather I don't care  
Everything is legal in the danger zone  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
Later we could cater to the animal  
Knowing that you're mine  
It's straight in my face  
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
In the storm of revolution  
What is done can be undone  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be committal  
To the subtle variations  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
If your love is for the givin'  
It's a case of destiny  
And you can find your source of pleasure  
In being with me  
  
[Chorus]

Fool in the night on the stair,  
With the light by the window.  
Out in the jungle of life she was  
Yearning to go.  
  
All of the years I've been there for the tears  
She will sell you.  
Out in the city she search for the face  
That she knew.  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Caroline,  
Fallen Angel.  
Caroline.  
Oh oh oh,  
Fallen Angel,  
I'm so lost,  
Tonight, lonely tonight.  
Lonely tonight.  
  
Fool is the father who clings to the  
Child he is losing.  
Mother too weary to question  
The wisdom of youth.  
  
There with your head in your handa  
As you pray to her picture.  
Out in the rain she would search  
For somebody to hold.  
  
Did you believe you could find  
What you need with a stranger?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Caroline,  
Fallen Angel

No matter how long it takes  
No mater how long  
No matter how long it takes  
Well never be alone  
Don't wanna make a wrong headline  
No matter how strong  
They'll be watching every move you make  
Don't let em know they can beat you  
  
Fortune favor the brave  
Learn how to use that muscle  
Take a little chance will get you  
Everything you see  
Living at the speed of light  
Gotta make your heart beat faster  
You gotta climb inside  
Set that spirit free  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
Stumble on the ground that shakes you  
Push it to the point that breaks you  
Little bit of fire it gives you  
Soul of a winner  
Help you bring them to their knees  
  
In the face of the foe  
Never let em drag you under  
Don't you wanna leave behind ya  
A legacy  
Catch another streak of lightning  
By the God of fire and thunder  
Battle in the name of the nation  
Making history  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
And brother when you're down to zero  
Everybody needs that hero  
Gotta be a star to follow  
All the way there  
And all the way home

When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
We used to love while others used to play.  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,  
And you don't ask the time of day.  
But you and I, our love will never die,  
But guess we'll cry come first of May.  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me,  
I watched the apples falling one by one.  
And I recall the moment of them all,  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
Do do do do do do do do do,  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.

I'm not that someone who's got what you want.  
I can do nothing but watch what you do.  
You just want someone to kiss you good night,  
But lips are never enough to get you through.  
You stole my nights and you got your way,  
Now you got me dying inside, oh baby.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say.  
Pick up the pieces of my life  
Into the night of day.  
  
How do you break this heart of steel.  
Nobody ever could.  
Open the pages of my life.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
I'll be your saviour but baby I swear  
I'm not living my life over you.  
Some satisfaction you get if you dare  
But is it ever enough to get you through?  
You stole my mind and you watch me fall.  
Now you leave the scene of the crime, oh no.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
When you're gone,  
You'll be leaving behind  
A broken man with something to hide.  
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity,  
You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say (ooh),  
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day (ooh).  
How do you break this heart of steel?  
Nobody ever could (ooh).  
Open the pages of my life,  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Gone are the days that came and went.  
Houses are made of wood (ooh).  
Live in a world of sand and stone.  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.

I stumble in the night  
Never really knew what it would've been like  
You're no longer there to break my fall  
The heartache over you  
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through  
I never saw the signs  
You're the last to know when love is blind  
  
All the tears and the turbulent years  
When I would not wait for no-one  
Didn't stop and take a look at myself  
And see me losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the lonely heart breaks  
It's the one that forsakes  
It's the dream that we stole  
And I'm missing you more  
Than the fire that will roar  
There's a hole in my soul  
For you it's goodbye  
For me it's to cry  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Seen you in a magazine  
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine  
  
Now I know but a little too late  
That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I know there'll be times like this  
When I couldn't reach out to no-one  
Am I never gonna find someone  
Who knows me like you do  
Are you leaving me a helpless child  
When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea  
I'll follow you anywhere  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]

Hush my darling , sleep my lover  
There'll be rain till we run for cover  
Lost in love in a world of strangers  
Something only the lord arranges  
Oh my darling , now I found you  
Want to live all my life around you  
You're my light in a world of sorrow  
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow  
I just want to hold you forever , forever  
Loving one another that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
Oh my darling , if you leave me  
I lose the love that has always freed me  
Not knowing angel , what's coming after  
Never hearing you're golden laughter  
Oh my baby , hearts like thunder  
Can't escape from the spell I'm under  
I surrender to all your treasure  
Endless nights of pain and pleasure  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
(break)  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
(repeat last verse and fade out )  

On a hill, inside a house in Covewell Reach  
Stands a man who's feeling very tired  
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago  
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show  
  
Every day I go away and find ideas  
Think I'll climb on top of somewhere high  
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead?  
Didn't really know if he was off his head  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day  
Mending fifty goblets that are worn  
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear  
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Now the house is burnt, along with Gilbert Green  
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry  
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen  
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
Now we can tell the world that he was right

I wish the world was run by all the little children  
We could be happy once again  
We won't hurt when we're like little children  
And we won't ever feel the pain  
  
Now when my fight for life on earth is over  
And i leave 'cause i can't stay  
All my love belongs to you hereafter  
And we'll all join hand another day  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got t fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand  
  
I love you , yes i do  
I told you a million times now  
Now do you believe the words i say  
All my life belongs to you hereafter  
And we'll all join hands another day  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give, take a hand

One, two  
There's a young girl lost on the edge of town,  
Don't see no future, it's blind.  
Don't give up when you're upside down,  
You just keep it inside.  
  
You know we all cry when we're alone,  
Someone like you  
And the promise that we won't be.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Don't be a hero in the name of love,  
Don't leave me waiting in line.  
No ties that bind, no ball and chain,  
The ghost is waiting outside.  
  
I'm searching so high,  
I'm searching low  
Someone like you.  
Baby, I'm not  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
You know we all cry when we are alone,  
Someone like you, we know oh,  
I'm searching so high,  
I'm searching low,  
Someone like you,  
We know oh, oh, oh.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
Giving up the ghost

Glass house, that once was mine , the sun will shine in on me  
You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me  
I remember yesterday , turn my tears to laugher  
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after  
  
I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying  
I remember all the words you were softly saying  
  
Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane  
It's ours , my love , until the day we say auf wiedersehen

The preacher talked with me and he smiled  
Said, Come and walk with me  
Come and walk one more mile  
Now for once in your life you're alone  
But you ain't got a dime  
There's no time for the phone  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I told him I'm in no hurry  
But if I broke her heart  
Then won't you tell her I'm sorry  
And for once in my life I'm alone  
And I've gotta let her know  
Just in time before I go  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
Well I laughed but that didn't work  
And it's only her love  
That keeps me wearing this dirt  
Now I'm crying but deep down inside  
Well I did it to him  
Now it's my turn to die  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on

I saw my problems and I'll see the light  
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right  
There ain't no danger we can go too far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word  
  
They think our love is just a growin' pain  
Why don't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame  
Their lips are lyin', only real is real  
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel, grease is the word  
  
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)  
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word  
  
This is a life of illusion, a life of control  
Mixed with confusion - what're we doin' here?  
  
We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word  
  
(Grease is the word, is the word, is the word)

Pulse's racing, darling,  
How grand we are.  
Little by little we meet in the middle.  
There's danger in the dark.  
  
It oughta be illegal  
Make it a crime to be out in the cold.  
It oughta be illegal  
You got a reason for living.  
You battle on with the love you're living on.  
  
You gotta be mine.  
We take it away.  
It's gotta be night and day,  
Just a matter of time.  
  
And we got nothing to be guilty of.  
Our love, will climb and mountain  
Near or far, we are,  
And we never let it end.  
  
And we got nothing to be sorry for.  
Our love, is one in a million.  
Eyes can see, that we  
Got a highway to the sky.  
  
Don't want to hear goodbye.  
Don't want to hear goodbye.  
I don't want to hear your  
  
And we got and we got nothing to be guilty of.  
Our love, will climb and mountain  
Near or far, we are,  
And we never let it end.  
  
And we got nothing to be sorry for.  
Our love is one in a million.  
Eyes can see, that we  
Got a highway to the sky.  
Don't want to hear, goodbye.  
Don't want to hear, goodbye  
I don't want to hear your  
  
And we got nothing

Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
Ah...  
Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
Ah..  
Ah...  
  
I've given all my love away and I've been left with none  
But can you say that I'm to blame for loving anyone  
I used to think that I was always older then my time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
  
Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
(had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah.....  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night  
(had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah...  
  
I'm casting all my dreams hereto , my fish have gone to sea  
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me  
I always used to think that I was better then my kind  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night (had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night

Though I know it's time to take you home,  
Baby, you and I are all alone.  
We could take a moment of our own  
And look what we've got.  
  
You could destroy this heart of mine.  
I'm only trying to get by,  
Hiding in the shadows of the night,  
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right.  
  
Show me some mercy.  
You know what you're doing is making me a happy man.  
I shield you from the rain.  
I've been slow to get you but I'm working as hard as I can.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen?  
And all the years of tears and laughter  
We could go through,  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you? Ooh. Ah.  
  
Heaven is a place inside of me  
Living with your heart as company.  
Only you can change the way I feel  
And make it feel good.  
  
Where there is love there is no crime.  
I'm only trying to get mine.  
Let me be the one to dry your eyes.  
We can be the promise that never dies.  
  
Light of an angel,  
Blinded by the vision I'm wishing we could travel on.  
Stay with me, baby,  
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you.  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen?  
And you define the dream you're after,  
Make it come true.  
Will it be happy ever after,  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you?

I'm a coming'

I know baby's bad for my self-esteem.  
Find another face for your sympathy.  
Some of us cry, some of them lie,  
but no one sees inside.  
  
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone.  
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone.  
Sounds of the night.  
Streets without light.  
And baby's not alone.  
  
Try to hold her to myself.  
Someone else is breaking all my dreams. She  
needs so many games to play.  
One more time I climb the stairs.  
Open up the door and she was gone.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter).  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
And the smile is no longer there.  
The face and the eyes and the hair.  
Nothing stands the test of time.  
You live forever, never mine.  
I cling to dreams that turn to sand.  
Our life is now a distant land.  
  
We commit emotional suicide.  
Every single room is electrified.  
Your memory shadowing me.  
The house where sorrow hides.  
  
Pull it down, blow it up.  
Help me send these walls of love away.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter)  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
(Like a lamb to slaughter)  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around

Night grows cold.  
I've been lonely so much  
Out of reach.  
Save it only for me.  
  
Nothing in life is the same.  
And the sooner we stop to start.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe you can hide your face forever.  
And God knows it's true  
That when you search for someone  
  
There's a heart like mine,  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
Souls on fire.  
Feel her voice in your ear.  
She goes on,  
Living only for me.  
  
Nothing you say could be wrong.  
'Cause you give me the lovers sign.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe we can share it all forever,  
But not 'til we do.  
I'm gonna search for someone.  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
And baby are we waking up together.  
'Cause God knows it's you.  
If there is love for someone.  
  
And there's a heart like mine,  
Somewhere in this world  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe we can share it all forever,  
But not 'til we do.  
I'm gonna search for someone.  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine

I got to say it and it's hard for me  
You got me crying like I thought I would never be  
Love is believing but you let me down  
How can I love you when you ain't around  
And I  
  
Get to the morning and you never call  
Love should be everything or not at all  
And it don't matter whatever you do  
I made a life out of loving you  
  
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying  
I'm crying in the rain  
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting  
Feeling no pain  
When will we meet again  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under  
My love for you  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
This world may end  
Not you and I  
  
My love is stronger than the universe  
My soul is crying for you  
And that cannot be reversed  
You made the rules and you could not see  
You made a life out of hurting me  
  
Out of my mind  
I am held by the power of you love  
Tell me when do we try  
Why should we say goodbye?  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
  
Oh  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted  
My love for you, ooh  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

Well, this is my last connection , I been slowing up the line.  
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine.  
Gotta get back to the highway , gonna get back to where I know.  
'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,  
Gotta go man, gotta go.  
  
Hell, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool.  
And if the sun don't set on my house babe,  
I'd be the last man to blow my cool.  
I feel my body shake.  
Well, there's so much left to say.  
Spend my life anticipatin'.  
Gonna find a way.  
  
Hey, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
So so tired.  
So so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Well, I don't believe in ev'rything you say just to save my soul.  
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole.  
Gotta take me from my suicide.  
Now you know it's love I crave.  
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave.  
  
So so so so tired.  
So so so so tired.  
I'm so so so so tired.

I was stood by the light as I looked through the window  
With the greatest intention not meaning to see  
I was there in the dark and I saw you together  
You were up in his arms , I was down on my knees  
Get the cards on the table  
No need to pretend  
You've got to be cruel to be kind  
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay 'cause  
  
He's a liar  
He's a liar and I should know liar  
He's a liar and I should know - ahhh  
  
Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember  
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet  
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather  
I was through the window and down in the street  
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive  
And it's not how I want it to be  
There's a hand on my shoulder  
He said I'll survive ,but-  
  
He's a liar  
He's a liar, and I should know liar  
He's a liar,and I should know-ahhh  
  
Release  
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive  
Was it not for the red limousine  
I'd be millions of miles from th scene of the crime  
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine -but  
  
I'm a liar  
He's a liar  
And I should know liar  
He's a liar  
And I should know-ahhh  
He's a (repeat and fade)

You got to walk a little slower when you're with her  
Take the time to be tender, that's the plan  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
You got to live for every moment that she gives you  
Make the one in a million understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
Now too many faces have come down between us  
And I was the fool to be  
And I can't deny you the wide open spaces  
As long as she stops loving me  
  
You got to stand a little closer when you hold her  
Make her feel like a woman , understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand

Oh you're a holiday, such a holiday  
Oh you're a holiday, such a holiday  
  
It's something I thinks worthwhile  
If the puppet makes you smile  
If not then you're throwing stones  
Throwing stones, throwing stones  
  
Ooh it's a funny game  
Don't believe that it's all the same  
Can't think what I've just said  
Put the soft pillow on my head  
  
Millions of eyes can see  
Yet why am I so blind  
When the someone else is me  
It's unkind, it's unkind  
  
Yet millions of eyes can see  
Yet why am I so blind  
When the someone else is me  
It's unkind, it's unkind  
  
Ooh you're a holiday, every day , such a holiday  
Now it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday  
It's something I thinks worthwhile  
If the puppet makes you smile  
If not then you're throwing stones  
Throwing stones, throwing stones

I have been lying under a pillow of dreams  
And feeling moments of swimming in cream  
This is the start of the end, goodbye  
Hours of facing my life, have damned  
  
You are a good friend  
Friendly as good friends can be  
Your father wants you to live on his knee  
This is the start of the end, climb by me  
Red sides and blue sides within, remind me  
  
I have been lying under a pillow of dreams  
And feeling moments of swimming in cream  
This is the start of the end, goodbye  
Hours of facing my life, have damned

First you say you needed me,  
Then you give me sympathy.  
They say good girls never win.  
Something good in giving in.  
How do I get through to you?  
You must be made of stone.  
  
Just when I was safe and sound.  
Love, you built a wall around.  
You take a hard line attitude.  
Time to send me back to school.  
Or take me, take me to your  
  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.  
  
You can knock on any door.  
I know what I'm looking for.  
Red light, hit and run.  
Time to turn the engine on.  
Pretty girl lives all alone.  
I must be going home.  
  
Hot as hell and cold as ice.  
Everything I sacrifice.  
I got to pick up on what you do.  
I just can't get over you.  
You take me, take me to your  
  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.  
  
Tell me what you really want from life,  
Loving you, darling,  
You got me infatuated,  
Good love is not for sale,  
I nearly gave myself away.  
  
Pretty girl lives all alone,  
Take me to your, take me to your  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.

La,  
I'm gonna buy myself (buy myself)  
a house without windows (windows)  
So I won't see you walking by (walking by)  
And you'll never see me cry  
For all the loving I had you treat me so bad and run away  
So when you look inside (look inside)  
You will never see me cry and cry  
In my house without love  
  
I'm gonna build myself (build myself)  
a house without windows (windows)  
So I can hide the pan (hide the pain)  
And you'll never see me cry again  
So when you're passing my way  
Each time of the day ,you'll feel the love in you  
And you can't look inside  
So you'll never see my cry and cry  
In my house without you  
  
For all the loving I had , you treat me so bad and run away  
So when you look inside ( look inside)  
You will never see me cry and cry in my house without love

I can think of younger days when living for my life  
Was everything a man could want to do  
I could never see tomorrow,  
But I was never told about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow,  
No one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
And how can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
La la la la la la, la la la la  
La la la la la la, la la la la  
  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da, da da da da da, da

I know your eyes in the morning sun  
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain  
And the moment that you wander far from me  
I want to feel you in my arms again  
And you come to me on a summer breeze  
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave  
And it's me you need to show  
  
How deep is your love, how deep is your love  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
  
I believe in you  
You know the door to my very soul  
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour  
You're my savior when I fall  
And you may not think I care for you  
When you know down inside that I really do  
And it's me you need to show  
  
How deep is your love, how deep is your love  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
  
And you come to me on a summer breeze  
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave  
And it's me you need to show  
  
How deep is your love, how deep is your love  
How deep is your love?  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
  
How deep is your love, how deep is your love  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
  
How deep is your love, how deep is your love  
I really mean to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down when they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me

Ooh. love was true yesterday  
I love you ev'ry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me 'cause to stare  
And then I knew, I had to have you  
  
You could be mine if you tried  
All that you do is tell me lies  
You think that love's a game  
But I don't feel the same  
I should have known that I'll get the pain  
  
Ooh, love was true yesterday  
I love you ev'ry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me 'cause to stare  
And then knew I had to have you

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through  
How many times must I tell you I love  
Tell you I love you times before  
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses  
I'm worth more then this , but you ignore  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying, yeah  
  
Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way  
Come talkin' my way , you'll find out  
My love for you will be stronger then truer  
I'll look at you and there's no doubt  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying, yeah  
  
I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through  
Baby, baby, baby  
My love, until the day we say auf wiedersehen

I see she  
Knowing what I came here for  
Get a little of your womanifestation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it grow  
We can draw the line on where we  
Let the fingers go  
  
Now I know me  
Never wanna lose control  
Making me the subject  
Of your warm initiation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it show  
You make me nervous but it's now or never  
  
Oh Oh  
You can be my message from above  
And it's time to say you're sorry  
We can sanctify our love  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the wind  
You can't just go movin' out  
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
  
It's you or me  
Gotta be a kill or cure  
Maybe undergo a lover's operation  
Nothing cuts like a knife can  
You don't wanna hurt me more  
Look at all that damage  
We could do together  
  
Oh no  
You can wear me closer to the bone  
It don't work to make me worry  
But the demon seed is sown  
  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the sky  
You can't make me hold on  
Better you shoot my love between the eyes  
  
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie  
And what I see as fact is fiction  
You won't let me die  
And I'm bound to be abused  
I won't let you cut me loose  
This love is out to get you  
When the blood begins to flow

True love is one thing I've been dreaming of  
I give my soul to you and when I do  
You are to me, the very deepest part of me  
In the darkness, is you that always shows the way  
The very air I breathe  
When hope is gone  
You give me all the strength I need to carry on  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
When you hurt me, then I become the night time  
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good  
It shows this heart is not made of wood  
When you stay with me then I can feel the sunlight  
The love light fills my eyes  
And through the tears I feel my fears just melt away  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be

I should thank you for the flowers  
Can't imagine how you came to think of those  
That same colour rose, for me  
My world is made up of memories  
You and I, the laughter and tears  
You never need to worry  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
I remember all the good things  
When you held me for the first time  
Things were right  
On that rainy night, for us  
Love, then, now and forever  
No time real and right where we are  
As good as my eyes can be  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be some many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
No one ever cried  
No one ever stood in the way  
Ev'rybody lies  
Ev'rybody buys what love is today  
You can be a fool  
In the beginning, baby you were there  
And when you're winning  
What do you do  
Don't ask me  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others but...  
  
(repeat last verse and fade out)

Look at me I'm riding high  
Don't know what's wrong with me.  
Can't you see I'm not the guy  
That I pretend to be.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
The more I try the more I fail,  
I'd like to run away.  
But if I try you pass me by,  
I know that I can't stay.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes  
I close my eyes. [Repeat: x3]

Now that we're alone.  
No more hide and seek.  
You are the highest dream to me.  
And as you softly sleep  
then I can tell you what it means.  
  
Locked in my arms like lovers lie,  
I will not let you slip away.  
Is this the summer of them all.  
Is this my night of nights  
that you came to stay.  
  
Here you are, owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
if you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.  
  
Seasons may come and seasons go  
but these are the truest words I know.  
Face to face, eye to eye.  
This is the summer of of our lives.  
One love that cannot die.  
  
Here you are, owner of my soul,  
never let you say goodbye.  
And there is something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last, we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside.  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that I could not love you more.  
  
Here you are (you are), owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last (at last), we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside (ah).  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.

It's too late to turn back now  
There ain't no space back there  
And how did I begin to lose my self control  
How did I begin to lose my self control  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be the one  
Remember it was only fun  
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
You know as well as I know you're my only friend  
You're my only friend  
My only friend  
My only friend

Mother, I'm going to join the Air Force today.  
I don't care what the neighbors may say,  
But I'm going to join the Air Force today.  
  
Mother,I don't care what my father might think.  
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink.  
But I don't care what my father might think.  
Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right.  
Don't ask me why, it's my mind ,  
It's better, it's better than being alone,  
Alone on the ground. Now I find  
  
Mother,I've got to join the Air Force you see,  
I've seen my friends and they all agree  
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea  
  
Mother,I've go to join the Air Force you see  
I've seen my friends and they all agree.  
That's it's better then joining the army or going to sea.  
Mother, Mother, Mother.

I held a party and nobody came  
Strangely I was upset  
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying  
"Have no regrets. Maybe your gentle friends had some delay.  
Don't try to take on the world"  
  
Made up my bed and decided to sleep  
Dreaming I was awake  
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink  
Nice clan, cordial crowd  
Birkworth suggested we sleep through the night  
I never knew him so well

For so long  
You and me been finding each other for so long  
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl  
Take it from me  
If you give a little more than you're asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
Darling mine  
I would wait forever for those lips of wine  
Build my world around you, darling  
This love will shine girl  
Watch it and see  
If you give a little more than you're asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
  
I, I just want to be your everything  
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be  
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string  
Oh baby mine, if I'd stay here without you, darlin', I would die.  
I want you laying in the love I have to bring  
I'd do anything to be your ev'rything  
  
Darling for so long  
You and me been finding each other for so long

The circus is coming to see you.  
The elephant smiles.  
Everybody can hear you say that's out of style.  
My brother is friendly for reasons, if I am the same.  
Just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain.  
  
So I laugh in your face.  
Your only one race.  
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
You lie just like the rest.  
But there's nobody best.  
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
  
I'll pull out your plug so your small.  
You'll slide down the drain.  
On the steps of St. Peter's you all look the same.  
  
So I laugh in your face.  
Your only one race.  
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
You lie just like the rest.  
But there's nobody best.  
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
  
The circus is coming to see you.

So I laugh in your face and I'm right.

Only last night when your arms held me tight  
you told me you thought our love could last forever, forever  
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought  
that our love could last forever, forever  
  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
And everyone cries as teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And when darkness falls  
can't seem right there at all  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
  
I lay down and die.  
The teardrops begin.  
I lay down and die.  
And die.  
And die.  
I lay down and die.  
  
The whole world joins in  
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin  
I lay down and die and I lay down and die

You say you don't need me  
I know where your love goes  
You go missing after midnight  
I should know better and the bed is cold  
And if you think I'm not the real thing  
I don't want to die of hunger  
I got my world created for you  
But you don't stay  
Not my imagination no more  
I can't be dealing with the bad girl  
Lives in your head  
You got your someone I , don't cry  
You go and take a strangers love instead  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
You know I love the way you do it  
When you do it right  
You ain't no one man woman  
Were you ever  
If you don't come back running  
When you've had enough  
And baby , you got it , I want it  
Show me what's left of your love  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
I won't be no dirty weekend  
I stay with you for good  
He can be your outside lover  
I've got eyes  
I know he's in your blood  
Just let me hold you for the hour  
I go where you lead me  
I need some inspiration from you  
I'm ready for the mystery , take me  
Don't let me fall  
Don't let me drown down here in the rain  
There is no alibi , don't lie  
You love a stranger and the world is pain  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)

I started a joke which started the whole world crying  
But I didn't see that the joke was on me oh no  
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing  
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me  
  
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes  
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said  
'Till I finally died which started the whole world living  
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me  
  
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes  
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said  
'Till I finally died which started the whole world living  
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me  
Oh no that the joke was on me

From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own (oh).  
  
You come to me, conspiracy of the night.  
The heart that you want just happens to be mine.  
Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains  
but you wind up on my side, and what will be will be.  
  
That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit.  
The face of a friend invisible on the street.  
If you are battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat  
and I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.  
  
Anybody want me, anyone know my name.  
Do it in a lifetime,  
you be dust and the soul survives.  
Evens up the score (ah).  
  
From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own.  
  
And I surrender,  
take me for all time.  
Love that lasts forever,  
and I surrender.  
  
We are elite, prisoners of the night.  
We fight to the finish and savour the delights.  
It's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet,  
I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.  
  
(I surrender)  
I will walk through fire to keep you safe and sound (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh no),  
and I surrender, take me for all time.  
  
You are the air that I breathe (oh)  
  
I will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound.  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh).  
This is my life (life) story (story), I've been lost and found (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour (in the final hour), turn my life around (oh no).  
  
And I surrender (surrender),  
take me for all time.  
I surrender , ah  
love as warm as wine  
I surrender ah ah...

I was a lover, a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy, my feet on the ground  
I didn't know I was on the way down  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
I had a billion or two in the bank  
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks  
You gave me all that a woman could give  
Less you're affection, I don't want to live  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
Cause you don't feel the same  
I was a lover, a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy, my feet on the ground  
I didn't know, I was on the way down  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game , it's only a game

Is this your voice I heard  
Speakin' my name  
I hang on every word.  
Each letter that I write  
Every day, every night  
But I just can't live and learn  
  
Talkin' to myself and believin'  
I could live without you  
Livin' on the lies and beleivin' that  
Love would stay  
Listen to me please and I'm beggin' on  
My knees before you  
But you don't show me the way  
No you don't show me the way  
  
He may change you're world and someday  
He may break your heart  
And you deserve no better  
If you love him I will step aside  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
So this is who you are  
And the rest of my life  
I dedicate to you  
And I know that love can't wait  
There's a moon and a sun  
And a dream that sees me through  
  
A little bit of change and  
A little bit of my desire  
I was shakin' all over and  
I didn't know what to say  
I'm the man in the middle and  
The middle man catches fire  
But I don't know how to go away  
No I don't know how to go away  
  
He became your hero somehow  
I became your clown  
And you deserve no better but my love  
Is here and all I found  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't take your heart  
You know I will  
  
It ain't wise  
It ain't smart  
You say there's no doubt about it  
If you decide  
You got somebody else  
When I want you to myself  
I can't stop  
I can't look  
I can't say no more about it  
But my love will go on  
Just as long as the river flows  
  
He will be your king but someday  
He may let you down  
Follow to the letter that my love is  
Real and what I found  
I offer it to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will

(Kenny Rogers On Vocals)  
  
I saw you tonight  
In the room where love had started once before.  
And we opened up the skies.  
With your loving eyes  
You take me back where you belong in my heart.  
  
One love frozen in time.  
Never be a bad love.  
Yours and mine.  
But I still remain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you.  
And then being close to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
You are inside of me.  
One more time.  
Don't you remember me.  
And the days that lie ahead  
May all go wrong.  
  
But tonight, my love,  
There's no question in my mind where we should be.  
It's clear that you're alone and I'm alone.  
And all the fools have gone.  
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes.  
  
True love can never die.  
We can make it one day, if we try.  
Be there, sunshine or rain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
I got a memory  
For all time.  
Don't you remember me.  
Now my dream will come true  
If you love me.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.

I been thinking sitting on a pole.  
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.  
Just me and the mirror and my brain.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
  
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.  
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.  
Fifteen million years I spent down the line.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone  
  
That was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone.  
  
That's when I got an idea [Repeat: x2]

Don't know why  
I'm surviving every lonely day  
When there's got to be  
No chance for me  
  
My life would end  
And it don't matter how I cry  
My tears of love  
Are a waste of time  
If I turn away  
  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh  
  
Can't let go  
And it doesn't matter how I try  
I gave it all so easily  
To you my love  
  
To dreams that never will come true  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh

I could be king of kings, wear a crown and all the things  
I'd want I'd never need.  
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane and every year I'd fly to Spain.  
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tell me how to say goodbye.  
I see her face in myself.  
Why, tell me why I made her cry  
If only had my mind on something else.  
  
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.  
A hero with a medal for everyday.  
I find me fame,reach the top.  
I keep on pushing never stop.  
If I could just forget her name.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If only had my mind on something else.

Maybe it's been so long  
Our house looks kind of different  
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll kiss your memory  
As though you were here  
I'll hold your memories till you reappear  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over  
And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me  
And I will wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]

So this is who I am,  
And this is all I know.  
And I must choose to live,  
For all that I can give,  
The spark that makes the power grow.  
  
And I will stand for my dream if I can,  
Symbol of my faith in who I am,  
But you are my only.  
  
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead.  
And I won't let my heart control my head.  
But you are my only.  
  
We don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
And I know what I've got to be  
  
Immortality.  
I make my journey through eternity.  
I keep the memory of you and me inside.  
  
Fulfill your destiny.  
Is there within the child?  
My storm will never end.  
My fate is on the wind.  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild.  
  
But we don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
I'll make them all remember me.  
  
'cause I have found a dream that must come true.  
Every ounce of me must see it through.  
You are my only.  
  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play.  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way.  
I will make them give to me..(yeah)  
  
Immortality.(oh baby)  
There is a vision and a fire in me.(oh)  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside.  
  
We don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
With all my love for you.  
And what else we may do?..  
We don't say goodbye.

In the morning when the moon is at it's rest,  
You will see me at the time I love the best  
Watching rainbows play on sunlight,  
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning.  
'tis the morning of my life.  
  
In the daytime I will meet you as before.  
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor,  
Building castles in the shifting sands  
In a world that no one understands,  
In the morning.  
  
'tis the morning of my life,  
In the morning of my life the  
Minutes take so long to drift away  
Please be patient with your life  
It's only morning and you're still to live your day  
In the evening I will fly you to the moon  
To the top right hand corner of  
The ceiling in my room  
  
Where I'll stay until the sun shines  
Another day to swing on clothes lines  
May I be yawning  
  
It is the morning of my life  
It is the morning of my life  
In the morning  
In the morning  
In the morning

All day, all night you feel as if the earth could fly.  
Three more all for fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry,  
Fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry.  
  
Small town, closed down,  
There's nowhere else around to try.  
Disturbingly a voice would cry,  
"Go home, no loan,  
You'll have you gin and whiskey dry,  
You'll have your gin and whiskey dry".  
  
Four ten, four men lining up for their handy brandy.  
All's gone, you're none, came the bartender's reply.  
But I've tried and I'm tied to Indian Gin and whiskey dry.  
  
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry [Repeat: x4]

I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
You know I love getting up in the morning  
When the sun first strikes the trees  
All the morning birds are sing above  
Still bring back memories  
Of a girl who stood beside me  
When the rights I did were wrong  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
She never told me why she left me  
But the letter say goodbye  
Now my mornings are for wondering  
And my nights to reason why  
Why the stranger comes to steal the love  
Of a girl I had hold  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
So I sing  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.

In the name of love and life  
Turn your face to the lonely night  
But you're not alone when she calls you home  
And this your world is on the edge  
As good as lost but you know the way  
Through the faceless town  
And she pulls me down  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
So long ago  
And all through the years (never dies)  
All things must pass  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
God of love, god of gold  
Ring of fire in the days of old  
It's what I'm living for and love's the only law  
So answer Mayday, S.O.S.  
Search me North, East, South, or West  
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss  
  
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
I share to the end  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal magic  
How far can you go?  
The rolling of thunder and,  
You decide what you're after  
  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
We share to the end  
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
There's bound to be heartbreak  
You make it the hard way  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly

Hello angel , do you know me ,I'm you man  
Would that be hard for you to try and understand  
I've been waiting for this day for so so long  
Could lovin' you be so so wrong  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby , I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember all the nights  
And all the love we went through  
Well you know maybe I thought you had some left over  
Could I mean that much to you  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby, I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door  
  
Now open up your arms and take me  
Make me love you till I die  
You wouldn't have me when I was a young man  
But tonight I'm gonna try  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby , I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door

Don't get too close to me, don't overreact  
You're not the enemy as a matter of fact  
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore  
Gonna stick by you, gonna stumble over what to do  
  
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything  
I want it, good loving, bring out the beast in me  
I want it, good loving,wanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if you disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if you disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why  
  
So many tell you that you can't win  
It's a battle if you're lonely or if you're starting over  
Two-fisted and fast on your feet  
And you know there's something more  
And the city kicks it out of you and  
  
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything  
I want it, good loving, bring out the worst in me  
I want it, good loving, wanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You're in trouble if  
(Trouble)  
You disagree with me  
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong  
You find out why

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles  
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under  
The spell of her jingle jangle  
  
We used to cry on each others shoulder  
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead  
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of  
Silvery bangles, remain in my head  
  
Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles  
She used to wander and that's why I'm under  
The spell of her jingle jangle

I steal the night away  
Drivin' my life away, dancin'  
I was a romeo  
I knew the art of romancin'  
I was just one of the guys  
And I thought I had it made  
I needed someone to show me how to love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
The night was magic when we first met  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
For me and my baby, Juliet  
  
Fighting with destiny, fortune and fame but kept losing  
Playin' a joker's game, only myself I was foolin'  
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams  
You've broken down all the walls with your love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
  
Close your eyes, Juliet, don't let go  
  
On and on, our love is like the sun  
It keeps going strong throughout eternity  
I wanna love you in my life, sweet Juliet  
Livin' without you in my life, oh my girl Juliet  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet, Ah...  
Juliet, oh Juliet

Jumbo said to say goodnight  
See you in the morning  
Please don't lose your appetite  
He knows who is yawning  
tomorrow you can climb a moutain  
Sail a sailboat trough a fountain  
  
Jumbo said he say goodnight  
Play no games , he'd say to me  
We know who is wrong  
So please don't make no hesitation  
There will be no recriation  
  
Jumbo said to say goodnight  
He's a friend of yours  
Listen you can chew it  
If it's loud enough you can hear it  
  
'Cause it's narrow as a sparrow  
And it shoots a bow and arrow  
Thro'a top that's made with  
Powder with a gun it's even louder  
  
And it's shattering to hear  
Yuo mustn't listen with your ear  
But it gets to you  
Yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes !

Babe  
It seems every night and day, I get to lose  
And I always held the faith inside  
That love would find a way  
And I always reached for more  
Than the others ever saw  
  
I was always the first to follow  
My foolish prayer  
And the feelings that I have are more than  
Any soul can bare  
  
Only when I wake  
Then I can be sure of who I am  
I'm half the man I should be  
When you're gone and you're telling me  
  
This is love but just in case  
I keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Right here or out in space  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case, just in case.  
  
Tell the world that I come to claim  
Your tomorrows  
Let the universal word go out  
A million miles away  
And history has shown  
that when the seed is sown  
We are livig in a time when the tears fall  
Where they might  
But we hear each other much more than those who  
See  
We are not alone  
Love is there for everyone who needs  
And for anyone who cries  
And I will alaways have you here with me  
  
And you're telling me  
This is love, but just in case  
Keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Yours,mine and face to face  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case

I am a bird, watch me go drifting by.  
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by.  
That could mean everything.  
I am a street watching the people walk.  
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk.  
Then I hear everything.  
  
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours,  
Then I am everything.  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers  
  
That could mean everything.  
  
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours,  
Then I am everything  
  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers [Repeat: x4]

Never more aware of what you do.  
I got you leaving me and missing you  
And me believing that you've never done right  
When you've never done wrong.  
  
You been coming to me late at night.  
It's not the eye alone that gives you sight.  
I've never given anybody my soul,  
But I'm coming undone.  
  
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low,  
But I'm not ready to die.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life.  
  
Watch them hold you.  
Count their faces,  
A never-ending line.  
  
But they're only  
Imitations,  
Existing out of time.  
  
So now you're telling me it's just a ring.  
You say it's nothing but it's everything.  
I'm under pressure and I'm under  
Your gun and I'm fingers and thumbs.  
  
You got the questions and the answers I know.  
I'm being buried alive.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life.  
  
I can't stay here  
Lost without you.  
Strangers in the dark.  
  
Holy angel,  
Living for you  
To love and never cry.  
  
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low,  
But I'm not ready to die.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life, oh.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh

[Chorus:]  
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can  
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can  
  
When Kitty smiles, the world stands still  
I see a thousand golden daffodils  
But when she cries, the world just dies  
I see a million tears in Kitty's eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel  
She loves to see me looking like a fool  
I find a way with words I say  
To be in love in such a lonely way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now they are two and I am one  
I cannot fall in love with everyone  
So I must choose between the two  
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you  
  
[Chorus]

Alons, viens encore, cherie.  
J'attendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue.  
  
Then I may end.  
She had things to buy.  
I close my eyes.  
Yet I don't know why.  
I gave her money, said she knew someone.  
And she said she won't be long.  
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine.  
  
I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed.  
Then saw your face in an old photograph.  
I didn't think that I could live without you but what am I to do ?  
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine  
  
Come home again dear.  
I have waited year after year  
Under the lamp in our old avenue.  
If all in the world that's laughing, why should it make us cry?

Don't you drink with me ''cause you know that I'm a loser.  
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.  
Never did what people said. I should've.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
  
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy.  
Getting girls into trouble every day.  
Going from town to town.  
Now I tell you I've been around.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
  
Lay it on me, yeah,  
Don't you drink with me 'cause I tell you that I'm a loser.  
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.  
Going from town to town. Now I tell you I've been around.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.

Incidentally there should some changes made.  
You've got to work if you should have to save.  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.  
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.  
  
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear.  
You've got to take it easy if you dare.  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.  
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.  
  
Don't be blind you've got a thinking mind.  
Stop the bells that ring so loud.  
Don't nod your head you'll draw a crowd.  
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring.  
The lemon sings my song  
He's known it all along.

Let there be love, so I can be loved by you  
In Paradise Avenue  
Let there be life, so everyone lives to love  
Let it happen to me and you  
  
I am a man, so take me for what I am  
I'll never have everything, but let there be love  
Let there be love, let there be love  
  
I can be nothing, I can be something  
I've got to give you my life  
I'm tired of living without your giving  
I've got to get you for my wife  
  
Feeling's getting stronger  
Can't hold on much longer  
I never begged, but I'm begging now  
  
Let there be love, so I can be loved by you  
On Paradise Avenue, oh yo  
Let there be life, so we can live to love

Take a look at my face  
The world I say is you

When you look in my eyes (look in my eyes)  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else  

Lion in my winter.  
I'm a lion with no crown.  
  
You want to make me big man,  
A star on a screen,  
Some kind of James Brown,  
Or something in between.  
  
But when I look for money  
You smother me in charms.  
I can't live on glory  
When you're bending both my arms.  
  
I, I was a lion in winter.  
And, man, I had friends  
For miles around.  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.  
  
You're living in a cave, man,  
Upon your marble throne.  
You think you own the heavens,  
But you've got to be alone.  
  
You know, you know I prayed for sunshine,  
A woman with my name.  
I don't want to live, man,  
You gave away the game.  
  
I, I was a lion in winter.  
And, man, I had friends  
For miles around.  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.  
  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.

Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.  
Come sit beside me in your way.  
I see you every morning, outside the restaurants,  
The music plays so nonchalant.  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
  
Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.  
Come sit beside me in your way.  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?  
Lonely days, lonely nights.  
Where would I be without my woman?

Loose talk costs lives  
People like to play  
We're basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives  
  
Don't look at me as if you don't remember me at all  
There was laughter, there was pain  
But I won't make the same mistakes I made  
You are too beautiful to me  
I hide my tears inside the rain  
  
Am I the soul you cast your spell upon  
I had control and now it's gone  
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind  
And I will never say a word  
And I will never say goodbye  
  
Loose talk costs lives  
People like to play  
We're basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives  
  
I can see that someone hung a sign around your heart  
And it reads "do not return"  
And there is so much trouble I could cause  
Someone as beautiful as you  
You can feel my candle burn  
  
And I still recall some starry night  
We had it all, we held on tight  
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall  
And they will never know about us  
For just one moment you were mine  
  
Loose talk costs lives  
People like to play  
We're basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives  
  
For just one moment, just one moment, you were mine  
Loose talk costs lives  
(Our moment held in time)  
People like to play  
We're basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives  
  
Loose talk costs lives  
People like to play  
We're basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives

I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
There's been a diff'rence of opinion to the way I've been treating you  
But you know that I've tried to apologize,  
for all the bad times I've put you through  
On the chance that I could make you mine  
There's not a thing I would not do  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love  
  
I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies  
Through endless skies I will go  
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know  
That when I get you here inside my arms  
I never ever ever will let you go  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love  
  
I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling I was lost in your love

Love me  
Just a little bit longer  
Love me  
  
I remember times my love  
When we really had it all  
You were always there to make me smile  
To help me when I fall  
  
Ooh I can't believe you're leaving me  
When there's so much more to say  
I can't let you go  
Ooh Every time I look at you,  
I still can feel the glow  
Let it be, let it grow  
  
Ooh Love me, please  
Just a little bit longer  
Together, we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it  
  
Love me please,  
Just a little bit harder  
Together we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it.  
  
Oh all I ever wanted was  
To have you to myself  
Then I see you standing there  
In the arms of someone else  
  
Ooh You know a girl can stand so much  
And it's more than I can fake  
  
I can't let you go  
Ooh every time I look at you  
I still can feel the glow  
Let it be, let it grow  
  
Ooh Love me, please  
Just a little bit longer  
Together, we can make it  
Our love is much  
Too young to break it  
  
Love me, please  
Just a little bit harder  
  
Never even tried to see things my way  
It's hard on a woman  
When love ain't no love at all  
And when you walk away  
From me baby you're gonna be sorry  
I'm begging you please  
  
Love me, please love me, love me  
Just a little bit longer  
Together we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it  
  
Love me, please just a little bit harder  
Just a little bit harder (just a little bit harder)  
Together we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it  
Love me, please just a little bit longer

You say you saw the dark side  
Baby I know  
It Gets you through the night  
And love is like a red rose baby and so  
It's coming around again  
If we can take the same direction we'll find  
The road that never ends  
But love never dies  
It goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
This is the love you've been talking about  
You led her in till she couldn't get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
I go through holy war for you baby you know  
You say you ain't got a prayer  
I'll answer if you call for me  
Baby I'm yours  
To God above I swear  
I only wanna live in the shadow you make  
The soul never lies  
But love never dies it goes on forever  
Love never dies, love never dies  
It goes on forever  
You better run to the heart of the flame  
She don't change like the sun in the rain  
She don't understand why  
You made the little girl cry  
Love never dies, it goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
this is the love you've been talking about  
You led her in till she couldn't get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
You better run to the heart of the flame  
She don't change like the sun in the rain  
She don't understand why  
You made the little girl cry  
(repeat fade)  
  

She came on like the night and she held on tight  
And the world was right when she made love to me  
We were free  
She moved in like a friend, started loving me  
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms  
But the morning when I woke up  
I was here and she was gone  
Now I'm hanging on  
Maybe you can tell me how a love so right can turn out to be so wrong  
  
Where did she go when I need her close to me  
And the perfect story ended at the start  
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart  
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me  
  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
I could take it in my stride  
Start living for the moment  
Maybe half the things we sought were never there  
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size  
It isn't really fair

Love You Inside Out  
  
Baby, I can't figure it out  
Your kisses taste like honey  
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise  
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?  
  
Livin' on your cheatin'  
And the pain grows inside me  
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain  
Love you forever but you're  
Driving me insane  
And I'm hanging on  
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in  
  
Our love has got the power  
Too many lovers in one lifetime  
Ain't good for you  
You treat me like a vision in the night  
Someone there to stand behind you  
When your world ain't working right  
  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?  
Wrap myself up and take me home again  
Too many heartaches in one  
Lifetime ain't good for me  
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm  
  
Let this moment be forever  
We won't ever feel the storm  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?  
Don't try to tell me it's all over  
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line  
No man could love you more  
And that's what I'm cryin' for  
You can't change the way I feel inside  
  
You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow  
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow  
No man on earth can stand  
Between my love and I  
And no matter how you hurt me  
I will love you till I die  
  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?  
  
Repeat to fade

Everybody wants to leave  
Just like you and I  
I have all year to smile  
A tear for every eye  
  
Life closed it's eyes, broke my world, now I cry  
I've got to tell you, I've got the reasons  
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons, alive  
  
And would I pray  
What makes the world go round  
I haven't got today  
My mind is lost and found  
  
Life closed it's eyes and said goodbye, now I cry  
But I've got to tell you, I've got my reasons  
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons, alive  
And would I pray what makes the world go round  
I haven't got today, my mind is lost and found  
Do do do do do do do  
  
I'm a man for all seasons [Repeat: x4]

You've got a plan that could never go wrong.  
You took advantage and the damage done.  
It all comes back to me, baby.  
It all comes back to me.  
  
I played the fool and I went off the track.  
And when I think of all it cost,  
When the dice was cast,  
You know I had to be crazy,  
You know I had to be.  
  
I've been telling lies,  
And you forgive me but my heart still cries.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide, to hide....  
  
I know I let you down in so many ways.  
I know that sorry doesn't tell you  
What you need me to say.  
But, I would die for you, baby.  
Yes, I would die for you.  
  
I've been in disguise.  
And you forgive me and our love will rise.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah,yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah, yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle.  
The only man.  
The fool of a man in the middle.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man.  
The only man.  
That stupid man.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide

[Chorus]  
I'm a man on fire  
It's a burning thing  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby  
I'm a man on fire  
An eternal flame  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby, oh  
  
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour  
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feeling's got me  
I don't know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream, and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there, and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
I'm not a beginner  
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need  
Woman, when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]

Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,  
Something's telling me I must go home.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
The day I left her standing on her own.  
  
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,  
Gotta do the things I wanna do.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
They brought me back to see my way with you.  
  
Talk about the life in Massachusetts,  
Speak about the people I have seen,  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.  
  
I will remember Massachusetts

Who is the girl with the crying face looking at millions of signs?  
She knows that life is a running race,  
Her face shouldn't show any line.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a girl.  
  
Who is the girl at the window pane,  
Watching the rain falling down?  
Melody, life isn't like the rain  
Its just like a merry go round.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a girl.  
  
Who is the girl with the crying face,  
Looking at millions of signs?  
She knows that life is a running race.  
Her face shouldn't show any lines.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a girl.

I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know myself  
  
I've seen the lights of every city  
Tried to work out where I am  
I close my mind for the day  
I know the way  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know my self  
  
There's never ever anybody to rely on  
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
That's just circumstances , I must take my chances  
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying  
But I guess that's not true  
And you know that's true  
But there's a method to my madness  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes for the day  
I know the way

Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together, you and I.  
And all the bad is blown away.  
I never said goodbye.  
  
Is the writing on the wall  
That makes you see.  
And it's the saviour of my soul.  
And what I say that must be heard  
With love in every word.  
  
Close your eyes, don't let go,  
Don't get lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone you're not sure of.  
  
Broken wings don't arrive.  
It's a storm but you still survive.  
  
It's gonna take a miracle.  
  
So I go around believing you.  
I say good night, stay forever and  
Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night.  
And miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for.  
You were there and I was born,  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall,  
Tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Red, blue, black and white.  
True light shine on anyone.  
Two hearts make it right.  
And all that love can change.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall.  
We tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow

Girl, I've known you very well  
I've seen you growing every day  
I never really looked before  
But now you take my breath away  
  
Suddenly you're in my life  
A part of everything I do  
You got me workin' day and night  
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you  
  
Here in your arms I found my paradise  
My only chance for happiness  
And if I lose you now, I think I would die  
Say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
There are stories old and true  
Of people so in love like you and me  
And I can see myself  
Let history repeat itself  
  
Reflecting how I feel for you  
And thinking about those people then  
I know that in a thousand years  
I'd fall in love with you again  
  
This is the only way that we should fly  
This is the only way to go  
And if I lose your love, I know I would die  
Oh say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman
