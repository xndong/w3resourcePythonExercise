Well I rode a while, for a mile or so  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And the people I saw were the people I know  
And they all came down to take a view  
Oh the path was dark and borderless  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And it stung my tongue to repeat the words  
That I used to use only yesterday  
Meanings just dropped to the ground  
I tried to remember what I thought  
And what I used to say  
"don't let me go down" no don't let me go  
Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside  
The empty waste of another day  
Memories were blank to my eyes  
The fire and the glory of that night  
Seemed safely locked away  
Too hungry to rise. Too hungry to  
  
Well I rode a while, for a mile or so  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
And the people I saw were the people I know  
And they all came down to take a view  
Oh the path was dark and borderless  
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue  
But my head felt better as I turned the car  
And the airport slowly came to view  
One mile said the sign  
Checked my bags and made it straight to end gate 22  
Made it just in time, boy you've made it just in time

Baby, you're cool  
And even though you've never been to school  
I know you're fine  
But then you change your mind  
Then you start on driftin'  
And fall on behind  
  
You've been my girl  
You've been mine  
All of the time  
  
A bad night  
Its gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Ah, 'cause you left me waiting in the corner  
And I know you're never gonna come back for me  
And though you said you loved me  
And said you needed all of my love  
A bad, bad, bad, bad, bad night  
Its gonna be  
  
A bad night  
It's gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Maybe if the weather was just a little better  
It might not have happened that way  
But the situation was gettin' pretty bad, bad  
A bad bad bad bad bad night it's gonna be  
  
A bad night  
It's gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
I know I shall

In the blackness of the night  
I seem to wander endlessly  
With a hope burning out deep inside  
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out  
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt  
I'm alone and there is no one by my side  
  
In the blackness of the night  
I see a shadow passing by  
From the heels of an old soldier boy.  
There's no comprimising  
And his eyes are black as the sky  
For this bad, bad world he is going to die.  
He's alone and there is no one by his side  
  
In the blackness of the night  
I see a sparkle of a star  
From the sweet silver tear of a child  
And she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago  
When her parents were happy she was too young to know  
She's alone and there is no one by her side  
  
I'm alone and there is no one by my side  
In the blackness of the night  
I seem to wander endlessly  
With a hope burning out deep inside  
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out  
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt  
I'm alone, and there is no one by my side

Sit you down, sit you down young gentlemen  
There's something I want you to know  
You keep on asking me, keep on asking me why  
Oh why are we here? It started a long time ago  
Me and your mom on the night, yeah, yeah, yeah, we met  
  
I was on the road again, she was in C79  
I'll never, never forget, I'll never forget that night  
No, no, no, no  
  
We met in a back road, behind the stage  
She had the best figure by far  
A thousand hours I've looked at her eyes  
But I still don't know what color they are  
Yeah, me and your mom on the night, good lord, we met  
  
I was on the road again, she was in C79  
She was a junkie then, I was having a good time  
Back on the road again  
  
Oh momma, I was on the road again, she was in C79  
I'll never never forget, I'll never forget that time  
Back on the road again, yes, I'm traveling that line  
I was a pop star then, I'm still having a good time  
  
She believed me

I'm going home to the town where i was born  
Where little children laughed as they sang  
A happy song  
In the little town of Ceylon,  
Ceylon city, Ceylon city  
  
I've got a boat , i hope it's still afloat  
With rusty sails, and an old wooden oar  
It goes along, in the little town of Ceylon  
  
Ceylon city  
My daddy will be waiting there  
My sister will be combing down her silver hair  
My mama will be waiting there  
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere  
  
Ceylon city

Don't you feel a change a coming  
From another side of time  
Breaking down the walls of silence  
Lifting shadows from your mind  
Placing back the missing mirrors  
That before you couldn't find  
Filling mysteries of emptiness  
That yesterday left behind  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
That will stay and remain  
When your children see the answers  
That you saw the same  
When the clouds have all gone  
There will be no more rain  
And the beauty of all things  
Is uncovered again  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
And it won't be too soon  
When the people of the world  
Can all live in one room  
When we shake off the ancient  
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb  
We will all be born again  
Of the eternal womb  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Let's all start living  
Let's all start living, living, living, living  
For the one that's going last  
(The one that's going to last)  
(The one that's going to last)

I was a child  
Who ran full of laughter  
I was a child who lived for today  
My eyes full of sunshine  
My heart full of smiles  
I was a child for a day  
We were the children  
Who sang in the morning  
We were the children  
Who laughed at the sun  
Who listened to those who spoke with their wisdom  
We are the ones we would say, but  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday  
  
We are the men who worry of nothing  
We are the men who fight without aim  
We listen to no one, yet speak of our wisdom  
We are the pawns in the game  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday  
  
I was a child  
Who ran full of laughter  
I was a child who lived for today  
My eyes full of sunshine  
My heart full of smiles  
I was a child for a day  
  
We're getting older as time goes by  
A little older with everyday  
We were the children of yesterday

You never move, baby what's wrong with me?  
When we go dancin' , you're just there like a tree  
  
Baby come on and dance, you're holding me back

There are no words, I can use  
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose  
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you.  
  
Dreams I had just last night  
Made me scared, white with fright  
But I'm over to that sunnyside road  
Over to that sunnyside road  
  
Fortunes come and fortunes go  
But things get better babe, that's one thing I know  
And I'm over to that Sunnyside road  
Over to that Sunnyside road  
  
I have a friend that I have met  
Who gives me love and a certain respect  
Just a little respect, everybody needs just a little respect  
That means you...you...  
  
And in a little while our love will spread  
To you  
Ain't no matter who inside this world you know  
There'll he someone who will love you just for who you are  
Really are  
  
Dreams I had just last night  
Made me worried to face up to the light  
But I'm over to that Sunnyside road  
Over to that Sunnyside road  
  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on over and find yourself  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Oh darling, you see my face  
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place  
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste  
Can you...  
  
Oh love, sweet blue love  
No man can ever get enough  
But maybe one day we'll all die in love  
Will you...oh love, sweet love, my...love  
  
Oh babe, understand  
Take my love that's all I have at hand  
Please say you will...don't say you can't  
Oh will you will you will you  
  
The moment you walked inside my door  
I knew' that I need not look no more  
I've seen many other girls before, ah but darling  
Heaven must've programmed you  
  
The moment you fell inside my dreams  
I realized all I had not seen  
I've seen many other girls before, ah hot darling  
Heaven must've programmed you  
  
You can live in the largest house  
And eleven apartments too  
Run your own private plane  
And a boat in Malibu  
  
But 'till you know' deep down what inside you really need  
Well I love you baby, ooh my dear  
And I think about you sometimes  
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind  
  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on over and find yourself  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say  
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away.  
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you were born to
do'?  
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you.  
Love, love boy...  
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night.  
  
Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh  
Cause you've been a saving grace to me  
And I'd hate to face a day without you around  
My life would be without sound  
  
Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday  
Cause you taste to me as good as god made honey taste babe  
And the sky all glistens with gold  
When you're talking to me  
And the whirling wind turns to song  
Why it sets my soul free  
  
Love, love. love. Love must've made you on a Sunday  
There are no words. I can use  
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose  
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
And though my body's back I know it can't be real  
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel  
Oh where's it going, picked me up at seven  
When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning  
Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know  
This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time  
  
Back on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
The tied my body up, I'm forced to eat my meal  
A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too  
Now what's a soul to do  
Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me  
Is this a Eucharistic dove  
'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear  
But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place  
  
Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel.  
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel  
I made the cabin door, the pilot turned around  
He said we're Venus bound  
Oh please take me home  
After all I'm only human and the Earth is where I belong  
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face  
'Cause as he touched my head I saw myself back in bed  
  
I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel  
And though my body's back I know it can't be real  
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel  
The house of freezing steel

How great the wonder of the heaven  
And the timeless beauty of the night  
How great, then how great  
The Creator  
  
And its stars like priceless jewels  
Far beyond the reach of kings  
Bow down, for the shepherd  
Guiding him home  
  
But how many eyes are closed  
To the wonder of this night  
Like pearls hidden deep  
Beneath the dark stream of desires  
  
But like dreams vanished with the call to prayer  
And the dawn extinguishes night  
Here too are signs  
God is the Light, God is the Light  
  
How great the beauty of the earth  
And the creatures who dwell on her  
How great, then how great  
The Creator  
  
As its mountains pierce the clouds  
High above the lives of man  
Weeping rivers  
For thousands of years  
  
But how may hearts are closed  
To the wonders of this sight  
Like birds in a cage  
Asleep with closed wings  
  
But like works stops with the call to prayer  
And the birds recite  
Here too are signs  
God is the Light, God is the Light  
  
How great the works of man  
And the things he makes  
How great, then how great  
The Creator  
  
Though he strives to reach the heavens  
He can barely survive  
The wars of the world  
He lives in  
  
Yet how many times he's tried  
Himself to immortalize  
Like his parents before him  
In the garden of Eden  
  
But like the sun sets with the call to prayer  
And surrenders to the night  
Here to are signs  
God is the Light Everlasting  
God is the Light Everlasting  
God is the Light Everlasting

In the midnight moonlight I'll be walking a long and lonely mile.  
And every time I do, I keep seeing this picture of you.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.  
  
You never walk alone, and you're forever talking on the phone.  
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.  
  
I'm still waiting for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna
start.  
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'til then this is all that I can say.  
  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.  
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,  
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,  
Never to be mine, no matter how I try.

Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
  
Her father's rich, I think a millionaire  
But money doesn't make him better  
It just makes him better to be there  
So, you can tell him that it's quite alright with me  
No no, it's quite alright with me  
  
Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
  
See that shadow dancin' on the floor  
She's coming up behind me  
How I'd love to tell her she's a bore,  
But I tell her that it's quite alright, no no, it's quite alright with me  
  
Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
Oh oh

How many times must I get up  
Look out and see the same old view  
How many times must I wear the same old things  
And hear the same old things that I do, I do  
How many times must I clean this face my face  
And how many times must I shine my shoes, oh lord  
How many times must I drink the same old drink  
And dream the same old dreams that I do  
  
Because I, I know one thing  
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain  
But for your line and mine  
I want that loving again  
  
How many times must I pass your place. your place  
And how many times must I follow you, you  
How many times must I see the same old things  
When all I should be seeing is you  
  
Because I, I know one thing  
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain  
But for your line and mine  
I want that loving again, again

I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
All he asks from me is the food to give him strength  
All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get  
  
So, I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
All the pay I need comes shining through his eyes  
I don't need no cold water to make me realize that  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...  
  
I love my dog, baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na...  
I love my dog, baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na...

While lookin' into my drawer only yesterday  
You know, the things that I saw made me cry  
I saw the pictures and letters,  
I should have known better  
Than to try to deny  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
I'd do the same again  
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy  
  
And as I walked through the park where we used to play  
You know, the bench and the tree are still there  
And the pictures that you did,  
Why am I so stupid?  
They won't ever disappear  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
I'd do the same again  
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy

I used to trust nobody, trusting even less their words,  
Until I found somebody, there was no one I preferred,  
My heart was made of stone, my eyes saw only misty grey,  
Until you came into my life girl, I saw everyone that way.  
Until I found the one I needed at my side,  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.  
  
I think I see the light coming to me,  
Coming through me giving me a second sight.  
So shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine.  
  
I used to walk alone, every step seemed the same.  
This world was not my home, so there was nothing much to gain.  
Look up and see the clouds, look down and see the cold floor.  
Until you came into my life girl, I saw nothing, nothing more.  
Until I found the one I needed at my side,  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.  
  
I think I see the light coming to me,  
Coming through me giving me a second sight.  
So shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine.

You left me wearing nothing but a shell  
You left me wearing nothing but a shell  
This feeling you've left me,  
Is the image of hell  
  
I thought that you loved me  
Ah, but then I never could tell  
I thought that you loved me  
But then I never could tell  
This feeling you left me  
Is the image of hell  
  
If you loved me like you said that you did  
Oh, then darling you couldn't have done the things  
That you did  
You walk by my door, but you don't ring my bell  
You walk by my door, but you don't ring my bell  
This feeling you've left me, is the image of hell

I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
Tables of paper wood, windows of light  
And everything emptying into white.  
  
A simple garden, with acres of sky  
A Brown-haired dogmouse  
If one dropped by  
Yellow Delanie would sleep well at night  
With everything emptying into white.  
  
A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A Black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  
And everything emptying into white.  
  
I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
And everything emptying into white

I remember standing here  
Right on this very same site  
I was dying but for you  
It was just another night  
You once rocked me in your world  
You bought me my first shoes  
I was just another lonely child  
Oh and you were much amused  
  
So you took me and you dressed me well  
All for your friends to see  
Drained my body calmly till  
There was no more left in me  
Then you walked out and you cut me cold  
Out on the road somewhere  
Why it happened well I don't know  
And I still have no idea  
  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
You need a little help  
And who knows maybe one day you'll seek mine  
Only time will tell  
You once held me in your arms  
You made me feel so right  
I was flying but for you  
It was just another night  
  
But everybody needs a little help  
Whether or not you think you really do  
Everybody needs a little help  
Now the time has come for you  
  
I ain't looking to fight no wars  
No more talking trash  
I'm not seeking any more pain  
Cause I've had enough of that  
But don't you worry it's alright  
If you should come around  
Any night or any day  
I won't ever let you down

People polishing guns  
They've got nothing better to do  
Though they think they're having fun  
They're just living to die, if they but knew  
Now, now  
  
All day long they sit at home  
Waiting for the milk to come  
Watch them turn into stone  
Thinking 'bout the things they might have done,  
Now, now  
  
You missed the point, you missed the point  
You really missed the point  
  
Everybody's got to know  
Love's the reason we're here  
No matter which way you go  
Love's gonna meet you there  
  
Killing time, killing time  
Killing time, killing time  
  
You missed the point, you really missed the point  
Made me cry, I wonder why, why  
You missed the point, you missed the point  
You really missed the point

He was the King of trees  
Keeper of the leaves  
A deep green god of young  
Love stained memory  
We used to meet by him  
Far from the hustling town  
I loved you  
Now they've come to cut you down  
Down  
  
He was the guardian of days  
We held the same  
Beneath the shade he gave  
Shelter from the rain  
Oh Lord how its empty now  
With nothing save the breeze  
Now they've come to burn the leaves  
Don't burn the leaves  
  
And if my mind breaks up  
In all so many ways  
I know the meaning of  
The words I love you  
And if my body falls inside  
An early grave  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
So slowly as I roll  
Down the track  
  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
Please take me back  
  
He was the King of trees  
Keeper of the glades  
The way he enchanted my life  
Makes me so amazed  
We used to meet by him  
Many years ago  
I love you  
Now they've come to lay the road  
Don't lay the road

I was cold and so alone, but I couldn't help but moan  
When the life that I was shown started crumbling  
Then this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
I was searching all the world, looking for a girl  
Then a lady made an Earl of this poor boy  
Now this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
Now this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
I've never known a lady

Later,  
I want to talk it out with you  
Try to get my message through  
That's not all i want to do  
Later  
  
Later,  
I want to feel your body close  
From your head down to your toes  
Maybe help you fold your clothes  
Later  
  
I want to spread the news, don't want to soft soap you  
We're meant to live and love together girl . . . oh babe  
There's nothing i can do, oh darling  
I love you  
There's no way you can stay home, alone, babe  
Later  
  
I want to talk it out with you  
Try to get my message through  
That's not all i want to do  
Later  
Later...

Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
Love can take you by the hand  
Love can drop you where you stand  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
She can turn your head around  
He can lift you off the ground  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Love you make it what it is  
Life can change it with a kiss  
Love, love, love, love  

[Chorus]  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us  
Longer boats are coming to win us  
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door.  
  
I don't want no god on my lawn  
Just a flower I can help along  
'Cause the soul of no body knows  
How a flower grows  
Oh how a flower grows.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary dropped her pants by the sand  
And let a parson come and take her hand  
But the soul of no body knows  
Where the parson goes, where does the parson go?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Addition verse performed in live version of this song.  
  
Raise your mind up and look around  
You can see them, yes they're looking down  
From a lonely asteroid, in a vacant void.  
Dyin', but not destroyed.

Oh, the trees grow higher than the mountain  
In the land of free love and goodbye  
The rivers ever growin' the fish is flowin'  
And the love lives in the sky  
  
In the night flies a team of white horses  
And they glimmer clean in your eye  
The bird of dawn is bringin' the simpleness of singin'  
And the song lives in the sky  
  
The trees grow higher than the mountain  
In the land of free love and goodbye  
The rivers ever growin' the fish is flowin'  
And the love lives in the sky

Miles from nowhere  
I guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there  
  
Look up at the mountain  
I have to climb  
Oh yeah, to reach there.  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I won't need it when I reach the end  
  
Miles from nowhere  
I guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there  
  
I creep through the valleys  
And I grope through the woods  
'Cause I know when I find it my honey  
It's gonna make me feel good, yes  
  
I love everything  
So don't it make you feel sad  
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby  
I'll think to that, I'll think to that.  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Not a soul in sight  
Oh yeah, but it's alright  
  
I have my freedom  
I can make my own rules  
Oh yes, the ones that I choose  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I won't need it when I reach the end  
  
I love everything  
So don't it make you feel sad  
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby  
I'll think to that, I'll think to that.  
Oh yeah  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there.

One is the ever blazing star  
Sword of the immortal world  
And highest light  
Yes, this is our star.  
  
Out star is ever rising  
Born of the eternal lamp  
And holy fire  
  
Mighty burning mountain  
The everlasting love of one is  
One is one is one is one is one is  
One is the ever kindling star  
King of the immortal spark  
In heaven's eye  
  
Yes, this is our star.  
Yes, this is our star.  
Our star our star.

Well, first I have to tell you that I'm not insane  
And that once I was a famous archaeologist named  
In a recent expedition in a distant land.  
I just happened to be passing my hand in the sand  
  
And then I stopped, looked, and then I was hooked.  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone,  
Then the mist started, started to clear.  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone,  
And then it started to disappear  
  
Well, I walked and walked and never talked  
For many days,  
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place.  
I was just about to turn around and make way home  
When something told me that I had to see it again.  
  
And then I stopped, looked, and then I was hooked.  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone,  
Then the mist started, started to clear.  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone,  
And then it started to disappear.  
  
A vu ray, a vu ray.  
A vu ray.  
  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone  
Then the mist started, started to clear  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone  
And then it started to disappear,  
And then it started to disappear,  
And then it started to disappear.

(Cat Stevens, Milton Nascimento)  
  
Midnight come, colors are melting  
White moon shivering on the sea  
Like a ghost up to the mountain  
Wax Queen will carry me  
I can see the forest for miles  
All the creatures small and large  
If you crumble I won't be living  
For my love would have no house  
  
Mountain, oh mighty mountain  
Show me secrets you have  
So I may become brother to Moses  
And live, live and be glad  
I can feel all of your powers  
Growing lighter in the dark  
If you crumble I won't be living  
For my love would have no heart  
  
White moon, white as my skeleton  
Who has seen martyrs among my brothers  
Yet strength remained in me to write the song  
Say no more! The children already know  
And their dreams grow strong like the trees  
In their minds where thoughts are plotted  
Is also where crystal suns are forged  
  
And they will be older than a thousand years  
So that they may open the deserts of the heart  
And in these dreams of the mountain  
Friendship will surface

Yesterday I was on the edge  
Hoping everything was going to work itself out  
A good honest man doing the work of God  
Trying to make things better for Him  
A lover of life in a school for fools  
Trying to find another way to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
New Music, Music, New Music  
Sweet Music can lighten us  
Can brighten the world, can save us  
  
My friend said well, I think I found a way  
To help make myself richer  
I said don't you know , well, it won't be too long before  
The bad ol' devil will get you back  
Back, I said put back your heart and sing , sing while  
You know you're still living  
Sing, sing, sing , while you know there's still  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a look at the world  
Think about how it will end  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined the band  
Think about the light in your eyes  
Think about what you should know  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined in the show Oh Oh  
  
Think about the light in your eyes  
Think about what you should know  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined in the show  
In the show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday I was on the edge  
Hoping everything was going to work itself out  
A good honest man doing the work of God  
Trying to make things better for Him  
A lover of life in a school for fools  
Trying to find another way to survive

There is a wind, my Billy, and it's awful strong  
Come for you, and anyone who's helped you along.  
  
But I want to live, live, live and let the stars shine bright  
Yes, I want to live, live, live and let it on alright  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go  
  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
  
And with this gun goes everything I want to say  
Not for you, but for anyone who takes it away  
Let it fill his life, life, life until there's nothing left  
Let it kill his wife, wife, wife until he goes to bed  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go  
  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange

Once I had a dream, that worried me  
Like a drunken guillotine  
Lingering just above my head  
Why, why, why, why?  
Why was I born "The Nine"  
Cursed repeatedly  
Who would know if I should die.  
  
No one needed me  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
Cold and silent was the house my name was on  
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one  
  
S'dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
All at once my bones began to change  
I was tall and young again,  
Sweet as rain falling on the snow  
Who, who, who, who?  
Who is he, who am I, and  
What laid in between?  
  
How can I say goodbye? No one let me in  
Can't see no need for Nine no more  
Now it's too late to open the door.

Oh very young, what will you leave us this time  
You're only dancin' on this earth for a short while  
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now  
They will vanish away like your dads best jeans  
Denim blue, faded up to the sky  
And though you want them to last forever  
You know they never will  
(you know they never will)  
And the patches make the goodbye harder still.  
  
Oh very young what will you leave us this time  
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind  
And if you want this world to see a better day  
Will you carry the words of love with you  
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven  
And though you want to last forever  
You know you never will  
(you know you never will)  
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still.  
  
Will you carry the words of love with you  
Will you ride, oh, oooh  
  
Oh very young, what will you leave us this time  
You're only dancin' on this earth for a short while  
Oh very young, what will you leave us this time

Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
  
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had imaginings and we had  
All kinds of things and we laughed  
And needed love... Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had simplicity and we had  
Warm toast for tea and we laughed  
And needed love.. Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you  
  
You were my sweet love, my first sweet love  
My lovey dove, my love lovey dove  
No matter what place, whichever the place  
I still see your face, your smiling face  
In childish dreams, inside my dreams  
Like king and queen, God save our dreams  
N'though time may face, though time may fade  
It ain't never too late, to learn about love  
Learn about love  
  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you  
Remember the days of the old schoolyard  
When we had imaginings and we had  
All kinds of things and we laughed  
And needed love... Yes, I do  
Oh and I remember you

Well I left my happy home  
To see what I could find out  
I left my folk and friends  
With the aim to clear my mind out  
  
Well I hit the rowdy road  
And many kinds I met there  
And many stories told me on the way to get there  
  
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out  
  
In the end I'll know  
But on the way I wonder  
Through descending snow  
And through the frost and thunder  
  
I listen to the wind come howl  
Telling me I have to hurry  
I listen to the robin's song  
Saying not to worry  
  
So on, and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out  
  
Well I found myself alone  
Hoping someone would miss me  
Thinking about my home and the last woman to kiss me  
  
Well sometimes you have to moan  
When nothing seems to suit you  
But never the less you know  
Your locked towards the future  
  
So off and on you go, the seconds tick the time out  
There's so much left to know and I'm on the road to find out  
  
And I found my head one day  
When I wasn't even trying  
And here I have to say  
Cause there is no use in lying, lying  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup, pickup a good book now  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup, pickup a good book now  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup, pickup a good book now

Now I've been happy lately  
Thinking about the good things to come  
And I believe it could be  
Something good has begun  
I've been smiling lately  
Dreaming about the world as one  
And I believe it could be  
Something good's bound to come  
  
For out on the edge of darkness  
There runs the peace train  
Peace train take this country  
Come take me home again  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
Peace train's a holy roller  
Everyone jump upon the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
This is the peace train  
  
Get your bags together  
Come bring your good friends too  
Because it's getting nearer  
Soon it will be with you  
Come and join the living  
It's not so far from you  
And it's getting nearer  
Soon it will all be true  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
  
I've been crying lately  
Thinking about the world as it is  
Why must we go on hating?  
Why can't we live in bliss?  
  
For out on the edge of darkness  
There rides the peace train  
Peace train take this country  
Come take me home again  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
  
Come on, come on, come on the peace train

Getting hung up all day on smiles  
Walking down Portobello road for miles  
Greeting strangers in Indian boots,  
Yellow ties and old brown suits  
Growing old is my only danger  
  
Cuckoo clocks and plastic socks  
Lampshades of old antique leather  
Nothing looks weird, not even a beard  
Or the boots made out of feathers  
  
I'll keep walking miles till I feel  
A broom beneath my feet  
Or the hawking eyes of an old stuffed bull across the street  
  
Nothing's the same if you see it again  
It'll be broken down to litter  
Oh, and the clothes  
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her

Oh randy, if they knew.  
I think they'd take me away  
Just for loving you, you.  
All alone in my own quiet way  
'Cause that's the way that I want it.  
  
Wish I could see you now,  
You and your cherry black eyes.  
My heart would never lie down, down,  
'Cause that's the way my arrow flies,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
You never said it would rain.  
You only told me that the sun would come again.  
You never said it would rain.  
Oh randy if you did,  
It wouldn't mean a thing.  
It wouldn't hurt me a bit,  
'Cause only you can break my wings,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
You drew my face in the sand,  
And ever since that day you made me what I am.  
You drew my face in the sand.  
Oh randy if I could,  
There's nothing I wouldn't give  
To live with you for good.  
'Cause that's the way I'd like to live,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
Randy, oh my randy.  
Randy, oh my randy.  
Randy, oh my randy.

Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to laugh a lot.  
Oh don't you remember the days of the old school yard.  
When we had imaginings and we had all kinds of things  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do, oh and I remember you.  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to cry a lot.  
Oh don't you remember the days of the old school yard.  
When we had simplicity and we had warm toast for tea  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do, oh and I remember you.  
  
You were my sweet love (woman)  
My first sweet love (Cat)  
My lovey dove (woman)  
My love lovey dove (Cat)  
No matter what [unknown] (woman)  
What ever the place (Cat)  
I'd still see your face (woman)  
Your smiling face (Cat)  
You [unknown] me (woman)  
Inside my dreams (Cat)  
Like England's queen? (woman)  
God save our Queen. (Cat)  
Though time may fade (woman)  
Though time may fade (Cat)  
It ain't never too late (woman)  
To learn about love (both)  
learn about love (Cat)  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard

She hangs her head and cries on my shirt.  
She must be hurt very badly.  
Tell me what's making you sad, Li?  
Open your door, don't hide in the dark.  
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me.  
Cause you know that's how it must be.  
  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
Her eyes like windows, trickle in rain  
Upon the pain getting deeper.  
Though my love wants to relieve her.  
She walks alone from wall to wall.  
Lost in her hall, she can't hear me.  
Though I know she likes to be near me.  
  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
She sits in a corner by the door.  
There must be more I can tell her.  
If she really wants me to help her.  
I'll do what I can to show her the way.  
And maybe one day I will free her.  
Though I know no one can see her.  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

Silent sunlight, welcome in  
There is work I must now begin  
All my dreams have blown away  
And the children want to play  
They'll soon remember things to do  
When the heart is young  
And the night is done  
And the sky is blue  
  
Morning songbird, sing away  
Lend a tune to another day  
Bring your wings and choose a roof  
Sing a song of love and truth  
We'll soon remember if you do  
When all things were tall  
And our friends were small  
And the world was new  
  
Sleepy horses, heave away  
Put your backs to the golden hay  
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done  
For your work has just begun  
There'll be the evening in the end  
But till that time arrives  
You can rest your eyes  
And begin again

You cut me deep,  
But now I'm gonna see you weep, yeah  
This broken man  
Is gonna do the best he can, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
You played with me like a toy  
And a little baby  
After I broke  
You just didn't want to know, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
My time will come,  
And you'll know when it's begun, yeah  
  
You'll know because  
You're gonna be just where I was, yeah  
  
I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart  
Baby I'll do without  
There'll come a day  
When I'll smash your heart  
And then turn away

I would have given you all of my heart  
But there's someone who's torn it apart  
And she's taking almost all that I've got  
But if you want, I'll try to love again  
Baby I'll try to love again but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed  
When it comes to lovin' me she's worst  
But when it comes to being loved she's first  
That's how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
I still want you by my side  
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried  
Cause I'm sure gonna give you a try  
And if you want, I'll try to love again  
But baby, I'll try to love again, but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed  
When it comes to lovin' me she's worst  
But when it comes to being loved she's first  
That's how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest

I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul  
Where I'll end up, well I think only God really knows  
I've sat upon the setting sun...  
But never, never, never, never  
I never wanted water once  
No never, never, never  
  
I listen to my words but they fall far below  
I let my music take me where my heart wants to go  
I swam upon the Devil's lake...  
But never, never, never, never  
I'll never make the same mistake  
No - never, never, never

I was seventeen, ou were working for  
Matthew and son,  
(the) beatles me the queen, and I wrote  
I'm gonna get me a gun, yeah, yeah  
It was like a dream in the star machine,  
Oh, no, izitso, izitso?  
I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted  
To travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart  
I never wanted to be la-de-da, go to parties  
'avec le bourgeois'  
I only wanted to sing my song well,  
So I could ring a small bell in your heart  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I was on the road, sleeping between lorry  
Lights, oh no  
Stone-drunk and cold, heading into a bad  
Night, yeah, yeah  
Just another bean in the star machine, hi ho,  
Here I go, here I go  
  
I never wanted to be a star buy my mum a  
Ferrari car  
I only wanted to run my own race,  
So I could win a small place in your heart  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Nature found a way, it picked me up off the  
Dark side, yeah, yeah  
Showed me another day, it made me sing  
'i think I see the light'  
Not another bean in the star machine, oh no,  
This time I won't go  
I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted to travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart.

Trouble  
Oh trouble set me free  
I have seen your face  
And it's too much too much for me  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble can't you see  
You're eating my heart away  
And there's nothing much left of me  
  
I've drunk your wine  
You have made your world mine  
So won't you be fair  
So won't you be fair  
  
I don't want no more of you  
So won't you be kind to me  
Just let me go where  
I'll have to go there  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble move away  
I have seen your face  
And it's too much for me today  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble can't you see  
You have made me a wreck  
Now won't you leave me in my misery  
  
I've seen your eyes  
And I can see death's disguise  
Hangin' on me  
Hangin' on me  
  
I'm beat, I'm torn  
Shattered and tossed and worn  
Too shocking to see  
Too shocking to see  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble move from me  
I have paid my debt  
Now won't you leave me in my misery  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble please be kind  
I don't want no fight  
And I haven't got a lot of time

If I make a mark in time, I can't say the mark is mine.  
I'm only the underline of the Word.  
Yes, I'm like him, just like you, I can't tell you what to do.  
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard.  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa, Where do you go?  
When you don't want no one to know?  
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead  
  
Oh preacher won't you paint my dream, won't you show me where you've been  
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind.  
Cause I will learn to understand, if I have a helping hand.  
I wouldn't make another demand all my life.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's my sex, what's my name, all in all it's all the same.  
Everybody plays a different game, that is all.  
Now, man may live, man may die searching for the question why.  
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now every second on the nose, the humdrum of the city grows.  
reaching out beyond the throes of our time.  
We must try to shake it down. Do our best to break the ground.  
Try to turn the world around one more time.  
Yeah, we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground  
Try to turn the world around one more time  
  
[Chorus]

When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
They tell me to leave you, leave you behind  
They tell my to leave you, just get you out of my mind  
They tell me to leave you, leave you behind  
Ow, forget all the good times that are making me blind  
  
I know you run around, and you'll never settle down  
And I should quit while I'm still on top  
But when you hold me, baby, in your lovin' arms  
I could love you forever, baby, but  
  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
They tell me to leave you, leave you behind  
They tell my to leave you, just get you out of my mind  
They tell me to leave you, just leave you behind  
Ow, forget all the good times that are making me blind

I know I think a lot  
But somehow it just doesn't help  
It only makes it worse  
  
The more I think  
The more I know  
The more it hurts  
  
With only solitude to meet me like a friend  
Oh, where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Maybe she sits alone  
Beyond the storm  
Across the raging torrent of the sea  
She knows I want her  
And she knows I'll always be  
How can I live without the love I cannot see  
Oh where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Oh  
I know there's someone there  
I hear her breathe  
Behind the silence of the dark  
But I know that I won't see  
'Til we open up our eyes together  
She'll look at me  
What a moment that moment will be!  
  
And she looks so light  
I could fly her through the night  
  
Oh  
I know I think a lot  
But somehow it just doesn't help  
It only goes to show  
That what you never miss  
You never know  
But I have loved you from the moment that we knew  
Oh, I love you  
I love you  
But where are you?

Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes.  
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train.  
Switch on summer from a slot machine.  
Get what you want to if you want,  
Cause you can get anything.  
  
I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?  
  
Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass.  
For your lorryloads pumping petrol gas.  
And you make them long, and you make them tough.  
But they just go on and on,  
And it seems you can't get off.  
  
Oh, I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?  
  
When you crack the sky, scrapers fill the air.  
Will you keep on building higher  
Til there's no more room up there?  
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?  
Will you tell us when to live?  
Will you tell us when to die?  
  
I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?

Now that I've lost everything to you,  
You say you want to start something new,  
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving,  
Baby I'm grieving.  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear,  
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.  
  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world.  
I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do,  
And it's breaking my heart in two,  
Cause I never want to see you sad girl,  
Don't be a bad girl,  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,  
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  
  
Oh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile  
Oh baby baby it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la,  
Baby I love you  
  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,  
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  
  
Well, baby, baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby, baby, it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.
