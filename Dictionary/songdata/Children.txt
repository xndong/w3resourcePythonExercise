Every body Pauses and stares at me  
These two teeth are gone as you can see  
I don't know just who to blame for this catastrophe!  
But my one wish on Christmas Eve is as plain as it can be!  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth!  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeth,  
Then I could wish you  
"Merry Christmas."  
It seems so long since I could say,  
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"  
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth.  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeth,  
Then I could wish you  
"Merry Christmas!"

Hush a bye  
Don't you cry  
Go to sleep my little baby  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
In your bed  
Momma said  
Baby's riding off to dreamland  
One by one  
They've begun  
Dance and prance for little baby  
  
Blacks and bays  
Dapples and greys  
Running in the night  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
Can you see the little ponies  
Dance before your eyes  
All the pretty little ponies  
Will be there when you arise

Come on everybody, clap your hands  
And say hello to all your friends  
Come on everybody, we'll show you how

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds  
In a believer's ear  
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds  
And drives away his fear  
  
Must Jesus bear the cross alone  
And all the world go free?  
No, there's a cross for ev'ryone  
And there's a cross for me

O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God she'd His grace on thee,  
And crown thy good  
With brotherhood,  
From sea to shining sea!  
  
O beautiful for pilgrim feet  
Whose stern impassioned stress  
A thoroughfare for freedom beat  
Across the wilderness!  
America! America!  
God mend thine ev'ry flaw,  
Confirm thy soul  
In self-control,  
Thy liberty in law!  
  
O beautiful for heroes proved  
In liberating strife,  
Who more than self their country loved,  
And mercy more than life!  
America! America!  
May God thy gold refine  
Till all success  
In nobleness,  
And ev'ry gain divine!  
  
O beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears!  
America! America!  
God she'd His grace on thee  
And crown thy good  
With brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!

As with gladness men of old  
Did the guiding star behold  
As with joy they hailed it's light  
Leading onward, beaming bright  
So most gracious God may we  
Evermore be led by Thee  
  
As with joyful steps they sped  
To that lowly manger bed  
There to bend the knee before  
Him whom heav'n and earth adore  
So may we with willing feet  
Ever seek Thy mercy seat  
  
As they offered gifts most rare  
At that manger rude and bare  
So may we with holy joy  
Pure and free from sin's alloy  
All our costliest treasures bring  
Christ to Thee, our heav'nly King  
  
Holy Jesus ev'ry day  
Keep us in the narrow way  
And when earthly things are past  
Bring our ransomed souls at last  
Where they need no star to guide  
Where no clouds Thy glory hide

The sun has gone from the shining skies,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
The dandelions have closed their eyes,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
The stars are lighting their lamps to see  
If babes and squirrels and birds and bees,  
Are sound asleep as they should be,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
  
The squirrel keeps warm in his furs of gray,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
'Neath feathers, birdies are tucked away,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
In yellow jackets, the bees sleep tight  
And cuddle close through the chilly night,  
My baby's snug in her gown of white,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
  
The squirrel nests in a big oak tree,  
Bye, baby, bye,  
He finds a hole in the trunk, you see,  
Bye, baby, bye.  
The robin's home is a nest o'erhead,  
The bees, they nest in a hive instead,  
My baby's nest is her little bed,  
Bye, baby, bye.

Autumn winds are blowing free,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Leaves fall down from ev'ry tree,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Red and yellow, gold and brown,  
Softly leaves come tumbling down,  
Autumn winds are blowing free,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
  
Autumn winds are whistling 'round,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Leaves go spinning to the ground,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh!  
Big or little, all will fall,  
As they heed the windy call,  
Autumn winds are whistling 'round,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Away in a manger,  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down His sweet head  
  
The stars in the bright sky  
Looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus  
Asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
The poor Baby wakes  
But little Lord Jesus  
No crying He makes  
  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my side,  
'Til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus,  
I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with Thee there

Oh, don't you remember, a long time ago,  
Those two little babies, their names I don't know  
They were stolen away one bright, summer's day  
And left in a wood, so I've heard folks say.  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh, don't you remember  
Those babes in the wood  
  
Now the day being gone and the night coming on  
Those two little babies sat under a stone  
They sobbed and they sighed, they bitterly cried  
Those two little babies they laid down and died  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh, don't you remember  
Those babes in the wood  
  
Now the robins so red, how swiftly they sped  
They put out their wide wings and over them spread  
And all the day long on the branches among  
They sweetly did whistle and this was their song  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh, don't you remember  
Those babes in the wood

Here is baby's storybook,  
(Palms together, like in prayer)  
  
Opening up wide.  
('Open' the book, palms facing upward,  
With pinkies touching each other)  
  
Here are birdies flying high  
(Thumbs together, use other fingers  
To flap, like wings)  
  
That you'll find inside.  
  
  
Here's a little windmill  
Whirling 'round and 'round.  
(Pointer fingers facing each other,  
Spin them around in circles)  
  
And here is baby's rattle,  
(Hand in fist, as if holding a rattle)

This is how the baby  
Goes to sleep at night.  
(Cup hands together at shoulder,  
Resting head on hands, eyes closed)  
  
  
Here's the big round sun  
(Make big circle with arms over head)  
  
That wakes the baby up.  
  
And this is how she takes a drink  
From her little cup.  
(Hand fisted, as if holding a cup.  
Bring cup to mouth to 'drink')

I know that your powers of retention  
Are as wet as a warthog's backside  
But thick as you are, pay attention  
My words are a matter of pride  
  
It's clear from your vacant expressions  
The lights are not all on upstairs  
But we're talking kings and successions  
Even you can't be caught unawares  
  
So prepare for a chance of a lifetime  
Be prepared for sensational news  
A shining new era  
Is tiptoeing nearer  
  
And where do we feature?  
Just listen to teacher  
I know it sounds sordid  
But you'll be rewarded  
When at last I am given my dues!  
And injustice deliciously squared  
Be prepared!  
  
Be prepared for what?  
For the death of the king!  
Why? Is he sick?  
No, you fool, we're going to kill him... And Simba too!  
Great idea! Who needs a king?  
No king, No king, nah nah nah nah nah nah!  
Idiots! There will be a king!  
But you just said...  
I will be king!  
Stick with me, and you'll never be hungry again!  
Yea!!!!!! Long live the king!  
  
It's great that we'll soon be connected  
With a king who'll be all-time adored  
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected  
To take certain duties on board  
The future is littered with prizes  
And though I'm the main addressee  
The point that I must emphasize is  
You won't get a sniff without me  
  
So prepare for the coup of the century  
Be prepared for the murkiest scam  
(Ooooh!)  
Meticulous planning  
(We'll have food!)  
Tenacity spanning  
(Lots of food)  
Decades of denial  
(We repeat)  
Is simply why I'll  
(Endless meat)  
Be king undisputed  
(Aaaaaaaaaah!)  
Respected, saluted  
(Aaaaaaaaaah!)  
And seen for the wonder I am  
(Aaaaaaaaaah!)  
  
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared  
Be prepared!  
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared  
Be prepared!

In winter I get up at night,  
And dress by yellow candle light.  
In summer quite the other way,  
I have to go to bed by day,  
To go to bed by day,  
To go to bed by day.  
  
I have to go to bed and see  
The birds still hopping on the tree,  
Or hear the grown up people's feet  
Still going past me in the street,  
Past me in the street,  
Past me in the street.  
  
And does it not seem hard to you,  
When all the sky is clear and blue,  
And I should like so much to play,  
To have to go to bed by day?  
To go to bed by day?  
To go to bed by day?

Hear the merry laugh of children,  
Hear the chestnut horses neigh!  
See the mice all scurry,  
See the farmers hurry,  
When it's time for  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Good smells coming from the kitchen,  
We'll get lots of treats today!  
Cattle are a-mooing  
Pigeons are a-cooing,  
As they watch us  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Pitchforks shining in the sunlight,  
As the farmers work all day,  
They were early starting,  
And they won't be parting,  
'Til we finish  
Bringing in the hay.

Brown baby, brown baby,  
As you grow up I want you to drink from the plenty cup.  
I want you to stand up tall and proud.  
I want you to speak up clear and loud.  
  
Brown baby, brown baby, brown baby,  
As years roll by,  
I want you to go with your head held high.  
I want you to live by the justice code.  
I want you to walk down the freedom road.  
  
Brown baby, now lie away,  
Lie away sleeping,  
Lie away here in my arms,  
While your daddy and your momma protect you.  
And keep you safe from harm.  
  
Oh, brown baby, brown baby,  
It makes me glad that you will have  
Things I have never had.  
When out of men's hearts all the hate is hurled,  
You're going to live in a better world.  
  
Brown baby.

As I was walking down the street,  
Down the street, down the street,  
A pretty little gal I chanced to meet,  
Oh, she was fair to see.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I stopped her and we had a talk,  
Had a talk, had a talk,  
Her feet took up the whole sidewalk  
And left no room for me.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I asked her if she'd have a dance,  
Have a dance, have a dance,  
I thought that I might have a chance  
To shake a foot with her.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin',  
And her heel kept a-knockin', and her toes kept a-rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin'  
And we danced by the light of the moon.  
  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,  
Come out tonight, come out tonight.  
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon.

Deep the cellar, timbers high,  
(Both hands point down, then up -- arms full length.)  
  
Pointed roof up in the sky,  
(Bring fingertips together over the head.)  
  
Drive the nails in straight and true,  
(Hammer with one fist on the other.)  
  
Build a house for me and you.  
(Continue to hammer.)  
  
Windows, shining eyes to see,  
(Circle hands at eyes and 'peek' in.)  
  
Doors open wide to welcome me,  
(Open arms wide.)  
  
Fire glowing, oh, so bright,  
('Warm' hands in front of fire, then rub hands together.)  
  
That is home on winter's night.  
(Hug self as if snug and warm.)

Were up at Camp Menzies. The camp of  
Our dreams, were streams let me ender  
And sparkers and gleames. So come on and join us. For we are never blue.  
Be a member of our happy, happy, crew you too.  
  
At night round the camp fire. We laugh  
And we sing. Give a cheer for Camp Menzies  
And let the echoes ring. We'll cheer  
For our campers our garden leaders to.  
We'll cheer for you and you we do.

You ought to see my Cindy,  
She lives a-way down South,  
And she's so sweet the honey bees  
All swarm around her mouth.  
  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
I'll marry you someday.  
  
The first time that I saw her  
She was standin' in the door,  
Her shoes and stockings in her hand,  
Her feet all over the floor.  
  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
I'll marry you someday.  
  
I wish I was an apple  
A-hangin' on a tree,  
And every time my Cindy passed,  
She'd take a bite of me.  
  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy  
I'll marry you someday.

Close every door to me  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
Do what you want with me  
Hate me and laugh at me  
Darken my daytime  
And torture my night  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
For I know I shall find  
My own peace of mind  
For I have been promised  
A land of my own  
  
Close every door to me  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
  
Just give me a number  
Instead of my name  
Forget all about me  
And let me decay  
I do not matter  
I'm only one person  
Destroy me completely  
Then throw me away  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
For we know we shall find  
Our own peace of mind  
For we have been promised  
A land of our own

You get a line and I'll get a pole, Honey,  
You get a line and I'll get a pole, Babe.

Great Granddad, when the land was young,  
Barred the door with a wagon tongue,  
For the times was rough and the redskins mocked,  
And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked.  
  
Twenty-one children came to bless  
The old man's home in the wilderness,  
They slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats,  
And they hunted in the woods in their coonskin caps.  
  
Great Granddad was a busy man,  
Cooked his grub in a frying pan,  
He picked his teeth with his hunting knife,  
And he wore the same suit all his life.
