We are running out of time  
We've got one foot on the rock, and one foot over the line  
This love, this love's not turning back  
Well I don't know about you, but me I'm following that  
  
Late at night, watching you sleep, and I know inside, I'm over the edge  
  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
  
Oh you, you can run away  
You can shatter my world, scatter my dreams all over the place  
But I, I've grown to love these chains  
You can tear 'em apart but I don't want to escape  
  
I close my eyes, picture your smile and I know inside, I'm over the edge  
  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
  
Oh, I'm over the edge...in a blaze of love  
  
(Down, down, down, blaze of love) Blaze of love  
(Down, down, down) In a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin down, down, down, down, down, down  
In a blaze of love (Blaze of love)  
Down, down, down, in a blaze of love...

One night, one empty room, one man gettin' over you  
One star, one lonely moon, I make a wish, I know will never come true  
You call my name, and you beg me to hold you again  
But the truth remains, I'm only a fool who can't help but pretend  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't let go until the love is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart  
  
Some nights, I try in my mind, I see myself learning someone new  
Still I know, I'm wasting my time, no one can take the place of you  
So I close my eyes, I swear I feel you here by my side  
But it's all only a lie, I need to believe for my heart to survive  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't let go until the love is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart, I keep holding on  
  
All this time I've been drowning in hopeless illusions I'm keeping inside  
That someday you'll walk out of the shadows and back into my life  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't believe your love for me is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on (With a desperate heart)  
Yeah with my desperate heart, I can't let go until the love is gone  
(All over but I'm holding on) I keep holding on  
(All over but I'm holding on) I can't believe your love for me is gone  
(All over but I keep holding on)  
(All over but I'm holding on)  
(All over but I keep holding on)

You tell me to be strong, tell me to be strong  
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry, it ain't no big deal  
You say I'll get along, sure I'll get along  
You're so nonchalant that it's unreal  
  
Well I thought this love would be all I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you, you say sorry babe, it didn't work out that way  
Don't let it ruin you're day babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my heart you're breakin'  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
I'll be all right, oh yeah  
  
Don't act so concerned, no don't be concerned  
Don't know how much more of your kindness I can bear  
Guess I had to learn, just had to learn  
That after all this you just don't care  
  
Well don't let that worry your mind now  
I'll be okay, baby I'll be fine now  
It's just that I'm watching my world walking away  
Don't let it ruin you're day babe  
  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my world you're takin' (Yeah
babe)  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
I'll be all right, oh yeah  
  
I thought this love was all that I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you just say sorry babe, it didn't work out that way  
Don't let it ruin your day babe  
Don't lose any sleep now babe, oh,  
Don't lose any sleep now babe, oh,  
  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my heart you're breakin'  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my world you're takin', it's just my world you're takin'  
  
Don't you worry baby it's just my heart  
Can't you see it's breaking baby

You know it's been a long long road  
Since I packed up and left on my own  
And I can carry a heavy load  
Just try 'n' get back to her heart  
  
I sure ain't got no home  
I seem to find love where I ramble  
And when it's time to go  
I hear that voice again, say 'n'  
  
[Chorus]  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
  
Leave a message with the rain  
You can find me where the wind blows  
The snow across the pain  
And the frost upon the heart  
  
You got no place to be  
Still you wonder where you're goin'  
And why I had to leave  
I hear a voice and it says to me  
  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
To her heart, c'mon  
  
I know it's too late now  
But I wish I could go back in time  
And start all over somehow  
And get it right from the start  
  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back

Ooh  
(Give a good heart, give a good heart,  
Give a good heart, give a good heart)  
  
When it seems that all hope is gone  
And so called friends aren't there to rely on  
When the darkness makes it so hard to see  
Just lift up your eyes, you will see me, yeah  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Gonna give a good heart, that's solid and true  
And I will always stand by you  
  
When it seems no one's there to turn to  
Everyone's a stranger passing through  
And all that's left is a broken dream  
Just hold out your hand, reach out for me, yeah  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Give a good heart, that's solid and true  
And I will always stand by you  
  
Now there's no need to dance alone  
In these arms you found your home  
  
Ooh, whoa oh oh, give a good heart  
Take my good heart, take my good heart  
Take my good heart  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Gonna give a good heart, that's solid and true  
I will always stand by you  
  
Give a good heart, hold you so strong  
Give you my shoulder to lean on  
Gonna give a good heart, hold you're head up  
So lift you're head up, lift it up  
I'll show you a love to believe in, yeah  
  
I will always stand by you  
Take my good heart  
  
Give a good heart, hold you so strong  
Give you my shoulder to lean on  
Gonna give a good heart, solid and true  
I will always stand by you

When all the hope is gone, I'll be there to keep you strong  
I will lay your body down in healing waters  
Turn this darkness into light, help you stand, I'll help you fight  
But don't ever let them break your spirit  
  
And have faith, (A light will shine on you) and someday a light will shine on
you  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
I will lead you down to healing waters  
  
When you cry out to the moon, I'll be there beside you  
I won't let these shadows reach into your heart  
Raise up the spirit of kings, let the bells of freedom ring  
Don't ever let them put out this fire  
  
And have faith, (A light will shine on you) and someday a light will shine on
you  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
And have faith, (Oh have faith) and someday the sun will break on through  
Then I will lay your body down in healing waters  
  
All your troubles, oh they will be over  
  
Don't ever let them break your spirit  
  
And have faith, (Oh have faith) and someday a light will shine on you  
And I will lay your body down in healing waters  
And have faith, and someday the sun will break on through  
And I will lay your body down in healing waters  
I will walk you down to healing waters  
  
All your troubles, they will be over, and we'll never ever, won't give up  
  
(Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down, lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)  
Healing waters (Lay your body down)

My love is drifting in a sweet dream  
And my heart is beatin' like a drum  
And my words don't make a sound  
And I'm dancin', but my feet ain't on the ground  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
I am flyin'  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But, baby, you hold so tight  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no  
But, baby, you won't refuse  
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no  
It's heaven, it can't be wrong  
I didn't mean to stay all night  
  
My thoughts are runnin' in a race  
And my mind is slippin' into space  
'Cause your world is all around  
So I'm dancing, but my feet ain't on the ground  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
I am flyin'  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But, baby, you hold so tight  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no  
But, baby, you won't refuse  
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no  
It's heaven, it can't be wrong  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay  
But, baby, you got your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around  
But, baby, you held me down  
  
I didn't mean to stay all night  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you get your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you hold me down  
I didn't mean to turn you on, baby, oh no  
To make you fall in love  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, honey, oh no  
But you just can't refuse  
And I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But you won't let go  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you get your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around, oh no

Take me back in time, just before the warm sunrise  
With your love inside of mine, you make my body shine  
All the lonely rules were broken, one magic night  
  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want that feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
Come and hold me  
  
I can see your face in my mind when your body moves so near  
Love is crossing every line and all time just disappears  
All the shut? doors were opened one magic night  
  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want this feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
Come and hold me  
  
Yeah  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want this feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
  
I feel like a child today  
I don't know why  
Stay now

If you want my love tell me 'bout tomorrow  
Cause I can't wait one more day  
Cold in the night waiting for a promise  
So all alone I'm hanging on  
  
Woman don't play this game  
You'll never get my lovin this way  
All this time you've been livin' for the moment  
It works for some, but not for me no  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not enough, to tell me you love me  
It's not enough, to tell me that you care (Yeah)  
It's not enough, to tell me you want me  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
If you want my love, then girl you must show me  
(Not enough) Oh show me girl  
  
We can make it last if we hold on till tomorrow  
Or will we throw it away  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart won't make it right  
  
It's not enough to tell me you love me  
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
If you want my love, then girl you must show me  
(Not enough)  
  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart won't make it right no  
  
It's not enough to tell me you love me  
It's not enough to tell me that you care (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you want me  
Darlin' you know  
Not enough to tell me you need me  
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
It's just not enough (Not enough)  
  
Oh, if you really want to know girl (Not enough)  
What it takes if you want my love

Love among the cannibals, love among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals  
  
I heard you sing about love, but that was a long time ago  
I was one of the ones who believed your lies, now your true colors show  
So we stand upon the grave of the promises you made  
With nowhere left to hide and no more alibis  
  
Dark teeth, bite deep, better not turn your back  
No show, move slow, remember to cover your tracks, get back!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love among the cannibals (I want to stand and shout) two-faced animals  
  
I move alone in the dark, feelin' too weak to fight  
Cause I know the dream is about to die, in the dim and dusty light  
Where the river used to roll a caravan of souls  
Move naked and alone, shining like a bone  
  
Night falls, skin crawls, darkness everywhere  
Too much bad blood, nobody seems to care, beware!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love (Oh) among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals (Love), two-faced animals  
Love (Love) among the cannibals, two-faced animals.

No intentions  
Whatsoever  
I was gone for a night  
Nothing's forever  
The cruel daylight  
Brought me back to my senses (Back to my senses)  
Got caught in here  
Under false pretenses  
  
No way out  
None whatever  
I made up the story  
Thought it was clever  
She didn't ask  
And I got no reply (Got no reply)  
But later that night  
I heard her cry  
  
[Chorus]  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
  
No accusations  
Whatsoever  
But can she forget  
Nothing's forever  
Since yesterday  
She's a little bit colder (Little bit colder)  
Won't happen again  
What could I've told her  
  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
Doesn't buy my story  
  
How can she tell the truth from the lies  
When does she know when to close her eyes  
She doesn't want to lose me  
So she only sees what she wants to see  
  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out she doesn't buy my story  
No way out, no way  
No way out

Looking in your eyes I see a paradise  
This world that I've found  
Is too good to be true  
Standing here beside you  
Want so much to give you  
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you  
  
Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that  
Put your hand in my hand baby  
Don't ever look back  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now  
  
I'm so glad I found you  
I'm not gonna lose you  
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you  
Take it to the good times  
See it through the bad times  
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do  
  
Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know  
Put your arms around me baby  
Don't ever let go  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us  
  
Ooh, all that I need is you  
All that I ever need  
And all that I want to do  
Is hold you forever, ever and ever, hey  
  
And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us  
Nothing's gonna stop us, whoa  
Nothing's gonna stop us now, oh no  
  
Hey baby, I know, hey baby, nothing's gonna stop us  
Hey baby, woo, nothing, hey baby  
Nothing's gonna stop us now yeah

Know what she's done to me, and I have been around  
She sure can bring you pleasure, and she can bring you down  
I should not tell you, if you want to learn  
To take a tip from me now, don't turn your back on her  
  
When she's promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
Chorus:  
In a private room, she'll dance for you  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room, she'll take your heart  
And with you under her control, she will leave you all alone, all alone  
  
I was a midnight runner on her side of town  
I used to get there early, to watch her dance around  
She had this way of movin', to tantalize a crowd  
When she lays eyes on you, you'd better watch out  
  
While she's promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
In a private room, she'll dance for you  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room, she'll take your heart  
And when you're under her control, she will leave you all alone, all alone  
  
She's no angel  
  
Late at night she might get lonely, I know what she really needs  
Someone who can hold her all night long, all night long, in a private room  
  
In a private room, she'll dance for you, oh yeah  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes, not too much more  
In a private room  
  
In a private room, she'll dance, she'll dance, dance for you  
  
Oh!

Yeah!  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
  
And I want to say, it's not the same since you went away  
And it's not right, you're not here with me tonight  
And it's a crime, just lying here, wasting my precious time  
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue, thinkin' 'bout the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
  
And I want to know, don't you see how you hurt me so  
Going out of my head, yeah I'm here in this empty bed  
And it's a crime, whoa, just lying here, wasting my precious time  
I'm so lonely, baby, I'm so blue  
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you

No na, na na na na na na  
You're into my thoughts like a dream on the run  
You're a vision of hope in a world come undone  
When the feeling is strong and you know that you love someone  
Make it tonight, make it forever and a day  
Baby reach out to me, baby reach out to me  
And tell me when it's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Say when, when love can steal your soul  
Say when, when love can take control  
Say when, when love can make you whole  
Just, say when, just, say when  
Say when  
  
I stand in the dark all alone in my room  
And I stretch out these arms to a girl on the moon  
Make it tonight, make it forever and a day  
Baby reach out to me, baby reach out to me, come on reach out to me  
And tell me when it's right  
  
Say when, when love can steal your soul  
Say when, when love can take control  
Say when, when love can make you whole  
Just, say when, say when, say when, say when  
Just say when  
  
No na, na na na na na na  
Say when, when love can steal your soul  
Say when, when love can take control  
Say when, when love can make you whole  
Just, say when, say when, say when, say when  
Just say when, when love can steal your soul  
When love can take control

In a line of fire I stand and wait for you, I can't hold out for too long  
Searchin' every part of me for a sign, I'm in the middle of a storm  
I keep hopin', keep on dreamin', somehow you'll get through to me  
  
So I reach across the silence, in the air, I keep hopin' for a sound  
Just a word or two is all I need, how can I bring you back around  
Can you hear me, can I touch you, show me the way to your heart  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
In my dark and lonely night I look for you, won't you save me from myself  
When my senses melt away you will be here and I won't need nobody else  
I can't hold back, I won't fight it, roll back this stone from my heart  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
Everything you are (Everything you are)  
Means everything to me (Means everything to me)  
I will wait for you (I will wait)  
Time is all we need (Is all)  
  
I keep hopin', keep on dreamin', somehow you'll get through to me  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
(Send a, send a, send a, send a, send a, send a) I'm ready, I am ready  
Send a, send a  
Send me a, me a  
Send a, send a

Raindrops falling  
Winter feels so gloomy  
Hear the knock upon my door  
Stranger calling  
Eyes that look like mine  
Said you know I've called before  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Familiar stranger  
Should I know your name  
Did we meet some time ago  
I feel uncertain  
Shadows whisper to me now  
Sudden wind begins to blow  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Darkened doorways  
Strangest things can happen  
Don't know who you're talking to  
Find yourself  
When lightning strikes you now  
You could be looking back at you  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Stranger  
  
Familiar stranger  
Should I know your name  
Did we meet some time ago  
Are you someone I should know  
Did we meet sometime ago

Bad is better than the burn  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
I'll take the blame it's my mistake  
One heart goes free one heart just aches  
It's an easy kill within my range  
I made the break honey you kept the pain  
  
And yesterday means nothin' to me now (Doesn't matter)  
I'll keep it hid you'll live somehow  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
I fished love's kiss from the wishing well  
Wound up in heaven stayed around for hell  
It's a common crime to live this lie  
I see no point after love has died  
  
I'll be the one who said good-bye (Oh yeah)  
And I'll take the heat for the tears you cry  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Or the hurt that's hidden in the heart  
They say you pay with what you earn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Cold is the shoulder that turns away  
Curses the man on judgment day  
Damned by the brand done too soon  
Crawled out of this house and howled at the moon  
  
And yesterday means nothing to me now  
I'll keep it hid, you'll live somehow  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn

Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to know  
And ride the wings of change, to a better time  
Come take the hand of hope, and learn the ways of man  
For you're the path that leads to the other side  
The skin upon our faces has melt the ice of ages  
Now our destiny is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Children lift up your eyes to the heavens  
Send your vision out beyond  
Children take up the torch and we will follow  
You're the light of the world  
  
Hear echoes in the dark from voices of the heart  
You teach the song of life we take for granted  
We've given you the key, so you'll unlock the door  
We're looking through your eyes to another day  
You bring a change of season, something to believe in  
Now our destiny is yours  
  
Children lift up your eyes to the heavens  
Send your vision out beyond  
Children take up the torch and we will follow  
Bring some light into this world  
  
Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to show  
Your voices will be heard, wish I learned  
We shelter from the storm, we can't make it on our own  
So lift our spirit to the other side  
  
Children lead us away from the sorrow  
You're the arrows from the bow  
Another kingdom awaits your arrival  
Giving freedom to the soul  
  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see

You already made up your mind  
Just who you're looking for and what kind of love you'll find  
Holding out for a dream  
But I can see you're lonely, living isn't only a fantasy  
  
I don't fit into your plans, but you can reach for my hands  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, 'cause tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
Really hate to see you confused  
I want no promises, so what have you got to lose  
When you look in my eyes  
Don't think about tomorrow, this feeling isn't meant to be analyzed  
  
Why should you be all alone 'til your heart finds a home  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, 'cause tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, tomorrow) Let yourself go!  
(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, tomorrow)  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right  
  
Tomorrow doesn't matter at all, I'm holding you and it feels so right  
I know you didn't plan it this way, let yourself go if you want to stay  
It's all right, tomorrow doesn't matter tonight  
  
Tonight!

(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
She's a special girl who wants to treat me right  
I can tell by the way that she walks  
A woman of the world who likes the city lights  
I can tell by the way that she talks  
I can't remember where it happened all too fast  
I don't know what you really want me to say  
But when she walked on by there was no turning back  
I knew she'd steal my emotions away  
Oh all this talk about what's wrong or right  
We gotta get to the bottom of this tonight  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now I've got trouble in mind (Little trouble)  
  
The word will get around that's just the way it is  
But don't believe everything that you hear  
'Cause when it all comes down to a love like this  
All the rumors will soon disappear  
Oh love can travel on a broken line  
But baby everybody has to take a chance sometime  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now I've got some, some trouble in mind  
  
Somehow there's something that I'm missin'  
I can't let you know oh-no  
(Right now) I gotta try and make you listen  
I'll be back in time  
Waiting at the end of the line  
  
Love can travel on a broken line  
Everybody has to take a chance sometime  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
'Cause we can always look back on what should have been  
'Cause you know honey right now I've got trouble in mind  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I won't give you up oh-no  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But baby right now I've got trouble in mind  
  
Nothin but trouble  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
Lock me up and throw away the key  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)  
I've got it bad  
(You know right now I've got trouble in mind)...

[Chorus]  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face  
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place  
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight  
Too many runaways eating up the night  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone's always playing corporation games  
Who cares they're always changing corporation names  
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage  
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street  
Police have got the choke hold, oh, then we just lost the beat  
  
Who counts the money underneath the bar  
Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars  
Don't tell us you need us, 'cause we're just simple fools  
Looking for America, coming through your schools  
  
(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge  
Out on a gorgeous sunny Saturday and I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic)  
  
Don't you remember (remember)  
  
(Here's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city  
The city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps)  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus:Repeats x2]  
  
(We built, we built this city) built this city (we built, we built this city)  
(Repeats out)

(Wake up, wake up, wake up, time to dream)  
We dream, we dream, we dream in color  
Wake me up in the middle of the night, tell me what you've seen  
Ivory clouds in a sea of blue, fields of endless green  
But we lie here and we search for stars  
Or big letters all the way from Mars  
The sky is black and the moon is pale, and we cry for this world of ours  
In the dark we still believe (oh you know that we still believe)  
In the dark we see  
Chorus:  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color like a rainbow in the night  
We dream of peace, we dream of love, but still the dream is not enough  
We dream in color  
Oh yes we dream  
I wake up in the middle of the day, locked within this cell  
The sun is weak on the gun gray street, a cold and concrete hell  
So I close my eyes and remember the days  
Of a blood red sky and a purple haze  
The flag was yours and the flag was mine, but we let it fade away  
In the dark we still believe (oh you know that we still believe)  
In the dark we see  
chorus  
This is where it all comes down, this is where the truth is found  
Someone's gotta keep this dream alive  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color like a rainbow in the night  
We dream of peace, we dream of love, we dream of life!  
We dream in color  
We dream in color we dream, yes we dream  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color and hold on to each other  
We dream in color lover to lover, sister to brother, we hold on  
We dream in color (repeats out)

A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter sky  
As the world and I go screaming into the phantom night  
It doesn't matter where it leads, I got nowhere left to go  
If there's any chance at all, it's somewhere down this road  
  
[Chorus]  
To be wild again, no one's child again  
Yeah I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again  
Oh to be wild again  
  
The fading light is cold on the shoulders of the trees  
Oh the star wind blows right through me, and I never felt so free  
Oh there had to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line  
And it came down to the question, is this life I'm livin' mine  
  
Had to be wild again, no one's child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again (Fire again)  
I want to be wild again (Wild again)  
  
There has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line  
And it comes down to the question, what is theirs and what is mine  
  
Wild again, no one's child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror, burn with life again (Life again)  
Yeah  
I want to be wild (Wild again), let the change begin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all, want to burn with life again  
want to be wild again, yeah, I want to be wild again  
Wild again

A close up of your soul is printed in your eyes  
I know I've lost control, I'm getting close to paradise  
Who knows to what I'm holding on  
So many ways it can go wrong  
And all my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
  
My heart is where you are, I'll always trust in what you do  
Your love will take me far, I'll only see the best in you  
But what if you feel like movin' on  
Leaving before the night is gone  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Oh that's all my heart needs to know  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't let me guess if your eyes speak goodbyes  
Heaven seems to be a place not meant for me  
  
It's quiet round my heart, there's no need for empty words  
Just let me go my way and leave before the silence hurts  
There's always one more chance to take  
There's always one more heart to break  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Is it time  
All my heart needs to know  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
Woo  
  
Someone's grip is always stronger  
Someone cares just a little bit more  
I'm holdin' on a little longer  
Just a little, just a little bit more  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Don't let me guess if your eyes mean good thoughts  
  
Oh baby don't let me fly  
Don't let me fly  
Don't let me down easy
